The action of 13-LOX on linolenic acid enables production of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) and its downstream products, termed ""jasmonates."" As signals, jasmonates have related yet distinct roles in the regulation of plant resistance against insect and pathogen attack. A similar pathway involving 9-LOX activity on linolenic and linoleic acid leads to the 12-OPDA positional isomer, 10-oxo-11-phytodienoic acid (10-OPDA) and 10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid (10-OPEA), respectively; however, physiological roles for 9-LOX cyclopentenones have remained unclear. In developing maize (Zea mays) leaves, southern leaf blight (Cochliobolus heterostrophus) infection results in dying necrotic tissue and the localized accumulation of 10-OPEA, 10-OPDA, and a series of related 14- and 12-carbon metabolites, collectively termed ""death acids."" 10-OPEA accumulation becomes wound inducible within fungal-infected tissues and at physiologically relevant concentrations acts as a phytoalexin by suppressing the growth of fungi and herbivores including Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium verticillioides, and Helicoverpa zea. Unlike previously established maize phytoalexins, 10-OPEA and 10-OPDA display significant phytotoxicity. Both 12-OPDA and 10-OPEA promote the transcription of defense genes encoding glutathione S transferases, cytochrome P450s, and pathogenesis-related proteins. In contrast, 10-OPEA only weakly promotes the accumulation of multiple protease inhibitor transcripts. Consistent with a role in dying tissue, 10-OPEA application promotes cysteine protease activation and cell death, which is inhibited by overexpression of the cysteine protease inhibitor maize cystatin-9. Unlike jasmonates, functions for 10-OPEA and associated death acids are consistent with specialized roles in local defense reactions.","10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid; 9-Lipoxygenase; Defense; Maize; Oxylipin","10 oxo 11 phytodienoic acid; 10 oxo 11 phytoenoic acid; 12 oxo phytodienoic acid; 13 hydroperoxide; 9 hydroperoxide; cyclopentenone; cystatin 9; cysteine proteinase; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; fatty acid; glutathione transferase; jasmonic acid; linoleic acid; lipoxygenase; oxylipin; phytoalexin; proteinase inhibitor; unclassified drug; Article; Aspergillus flavus; cell death; Cochliobolus heterostrophus; controlled study; cytotoxicity; fungus growth; Fusarium verticillioides; genetic transcription; Helicoverpa zea; herbivore; leaf blight; maize; nonhuman; plant damage; plant leaf; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; tissue necrosis",,"cyclopentenone, 28982-58-3, 930-30-3; cysteine proteinase, 37353-41-6; glutathione transferase, 50812-37-8; jasmonic acid, 6894-38-8; linoleic acid, 1509-85-9, 2197-37-7, 60-33-3, 822-17-3; lipoxygenase, 9027-17-2, 9029-60-1; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1",,,,"Wasternack, C., Hause, B., Jasmonates: Biosynthesis, perception, signal transduction and action in plant stress response, growth and development.

We found that many of the most abundant proteins are not associated with detectable levels of their mRNAs, and we provide evidence for three potential explanations: transport of proteins between tissues; diurnal, outof- phase accumulation of mRNAs and cognate proteins; and differential lifetimes of mRNAs compared with proteins. Likewise, many of the most abundant mRNAs were not associated with detectable levels of their proteins. Across the entire dataset, protein abundance was poorly correlated with mRNA levels and was largely independent of phosphorylation status. Comparisons between proteotypes revealed the quantitative contribution of specific proteins and phosphorylation events to the spatially and temporally regulated starch and oil biosynthetic pathways. Reconstruction of signaling networks established associations of proteins and phosphoproteins with distinct biological processes acting during seed development. Additionally, a protein kinase substrate network was reconstructed, enabling the identification of 762 potential substrates of specific protein kinases. Finally, examination of 694 transcription factors revealed remarkable constraints on patterns of expression and phosphorylation within transcription factor families.

As the first described plant peptide signal, systemin regulates antiherbivore defenses in the Solanaceae, but in other plant families, peptides with analogous activity have remained elusive. In the current study, we demonstrate that a member of the maize (Zea mays) plant elicitor peptide (Pep) family, ZmPep3, regulates responses against herbivores. Consistent with being a signal, expression of the ZmPROPEP3 precursor gene is rapidly induced by Spodoptera exigua oral secretions. At concentrations starting at 5 pmol per leaf, ZmPep3 stimulates production of jasmonic acid, ethylene, and increased expression of genes encoding proteins associated with herbivory defense. These include proteinase inhibitors and biosynthetic enzymes for production of volatile terpenes and benzoxazinoids. In accordance with gene expression data, plants treated with ZmPep3 emit volatiles similar to those from plants subjected to herbivory. ZmPep3-treated plants also exhibit induced accumulation of the benzoxazinoid phytoalexin 2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4- benzoxazin-3-one glucoside. Direct and indirect defenses induced by ZmPep3 contribute to resistance against S. exigua through significant reduction of larval growth and attraction of Cotesia marginiventris parasitoids. ZmPep3 activity is specific to Poaceous species; however, peptides derived from PROPEP orthologs identified in Solanaceous and Fabaceous plants also induce herbivory-associated volatiles in their respective species. These studies demonstrate that Peps are conserved signals across diverse plant families regulating antiherbivore defenses and are likely to be the missing functional homologs of systemin outside of the Solanaceae.","Innate immunity; Molecular ecology; Secondary metabolism; Tritrophic interactions","2 hydroxy 4,7 dimethoxy 1,4 benzoxazin 3 one glucoside; benzoxazinoid derivative; elicitor peptide; ethylene; hydroxamic acid derivative; jasmonic acid; peptide; phytoalexin; terpene; unclassified drug; article; Cotesia marginiventris; gene; gene expression; herbivore; herbivory; larva; larval development; maize; nonhuman; parasitoid; plant defense; plant leaf; priority journal; Solanaceae; Spodoptera exigua; Animals; Bodily Secretions; Cyclopentanes; Ethylenes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Herbivory; Host-Parasite Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Oxylipins; Protease Inhibitors; Protein Precursors; Signal Transduction; Spodoptera; Zea mays; Cotesia marginiventris; Hexapoda; Solanaceae; Spodoptera exigua; Zea mays",,"ethylene, 74-85-1; jasmonic acid, 6894-38-8; Cyclopentanes; Ethylenes; Oxylipins; Protease Inhibitors; Protein Precursors; ethylene, 91GW059KN7; jasmonic acid, 6RI5N05OWW",,,,"Green, T.R., Ryan, C.A., Wound-induced proteinase inhibitor in plant leaves: A possible defense mechanism against insects (1972) Science, 175 (4023), pp. 776-777; Chen, H., Gonzales-Vigil, E., Wilkerson, C.G., Howe, G.A., Stability of plant defense proteins in the gut of insect herbivores (2007) Plant Physiol, 143 (4), pp. 1954-1967; Gooday, G.W., Aggressive and defensive roles for chitinases (1999) EXS, 87, pp. 157-169; Vandenborre, G., Smagghe, G., Van Damme, E.J., Plant lectins as defense proteins against phytophagous insects (2011) Phytochemistry, 72 (13), pp. 1538-1550; Howe, G.A., Jander, G., Plant immunity to insect herbivores (2008) Annu Rev Plant Biol, 59, pp. 41-66; Adio, A.M., Biosynthesis and defensive function of Nδ-acetylornithine, a jasmonate-induced Arabidopsis metabolite (2011) Plant Cell, 23 (9), pp. 3303-3318; Schmelz, E.A., Grebenok, R.J., Ohnmeiss, T.E., Bowers, W.S., Interactions between Spinacia oleracea and Bradysia impatiens: A role for phytoecdysteroids (2002) Arch Insect Biochem Physiol, 51 (4), pp. 204-221; De Moraes, C.M., Mescher, M.C., Tumlinson, J.H., Caterpillar-induced nocturnal plant volatiles repel conspecific females (2001) Nature, 410 (6828), pp. 577-580; Turlings, T.C., Tumlinson, J.H., Lewis, W.J., Exploitation of herbivore-induced plant odors by host-seeking parasitic wasps (1990) Science, 250 (4985), pp. 1251-1253; Kessler, A., Baldwin, I.T., Plant responses to insect herbivory: The emerging molecular analysis (2002) Annu Rev Plant Biol, 53, pp. 299-328; Rasmann, S., Recruitment of entomopathogenic nematodes by insectdamaged maize roots (2005) Nature, 434 (7034), pp. 732-737; Unsicker, S.B., Kunert, G., Gershenzon, J., Protective perfumes: The role of vegetative volatiles in plant defense against herbivores (2009) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 12 (4), pp. 479-485; Engelberth, J., Alborn, H.T., Schmelz, E.A., Tumlinson, J.H., Airborne signals prime plants against insect herbivore attack (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101 (6), pp. 1781-1785; Heil, M., Silva Bueno, J.C., Within-plant signaling by volatiles leads to induction and priming of an indirect plant defense in nature (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104 (13), pp. 5467-5472; Kessler, A., Halitschke, R., Specificity and complexity: The impact of herbivoreinduced plant responses on arthropod community structure (2007) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 10 (4), pp. 409-414; Poelman, E.H., Van Loon, J.J., Dicke, M., Consequences of variation in plant defense for biodiversity at higher trophic levels (2008) Trends Plant Sci, 13 (10), pp. 534-541; Wu, J., Baldwin, I.T., New insights into plant responses to the attack from insect herbivores (2010) Annu Rev Genet, 44, pp. 1-24; Alborn, H.T., An elicitor of plant volatiles from beet armyworm oral secretion (1997) Science, 276, pp. 945-949; Schmelz, E.A., Fragments of ATP synthase mediate plant perception of insect attack (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103 (23), pp. 8894-8899; Doss, R.P., Bruchins: Insect-derived plant regulators that stimulate neoplasm formation (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 97 (11), pp. 6218-6223; Little, D., Gouhier-Darimont, C., Bruessow, F., Reymond, P., Oviposition by pierid butterflies triggers defense responses in Arabidopsis (2007) Plant Physiol, 143 (2), pp. 784-800; Mithöfer, A., Wanner, G., Boland, W., Effects of feeding spodoptera littoralis on lima bean leaves.

Auxin responses are initiated through activation of a transcriptional response mediated by the TIR1/AFB family of F-box protein auxin receptors as well as the AUX/IAA and ARF families of transcriptional regulators. However, there is little information on how auxin regulates a specific cellular response. To begin to address this question, we have focused on auxin regulation of cell expansion in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. We show that auxin-mediated hypocotyl elongation is dependent upon the TIR1/AFB family of auxin receptors and degradation of AUX/IAA repressors. We also use microarray studies of elongating hypocotyls to show that a number of growth-associated processes are activated by auxin including gibberellin biosynthesis, cell wall reorganization and biogenesis, and others. Our studies indicate that GA biosynthesis is required for normal response to auxin in the hypocotyl but that the overall transcriptional auxin output consists of PIF-dependent and -independent genes. We propose that auxin acts independently from and interdependently with PIF and GA pathways to regulate expression of growth-associated genes in cell expansion. © 2012 Chapman et al.",,"auxin; F box protein; gibberellic acid; phytochrome; protein AFB; protein TIR1; repressor protein; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis protein; auxin receptor, plant; cell surface receptor; F box protein; indoleacetic acid derivative; TIR1 protein, Arabidopsis; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; cell expansion; controlled study; enzyme synthesis; gene expression regulation; microarray analysis; nonhuman; plant growth; protein degradation; protein family; protein synthesis; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; F-Box Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hypocotyl; Indoleacetic Acids; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plant Proteins; Receptors, Cell Surface",,"gibberellic acid, 77-06-5; phytochrome, 117102-58-6; Arabidopsis Proteins; F-Box Proteins; Indoleacetic Acids; Plant Proteins; Receptors, Cell Surface; TIR1 protein, Arabidopsis; auxin receptor, plant",,,,"Davies, P., The Plant Hormones: Their Nature, Occurrence, and Functions (2004) Plant Hormones: Biosynthesis, Signal Transduction, Action!
