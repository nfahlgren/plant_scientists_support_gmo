The goal of this research was to increase the bioavailable zinc in the edible portion of cassava roots to improve the overall zinc nutrition of populations that rely on cassava as a dietary staple. To increase zinc concentrations, two Arabidopsis thaliana genes coding for ZIP1 and MTP1 were overexpressed with a tuber-specific or constitutive promoter. Eighteen transgenic events from four constructs, out of a total of 73 events generated, showed significantly higher zinc concentrations in the edible portion of the storage root compared to the non-transgenic controls. The zinc content in the transgenic lines ranged from 4 to 73 mg/kg dry weight (DW) as compared to the non-transgenic control which contained 8 mg/kg. Striking changes in whole plant phenotype such as smaller plant size and chlorotic leaves were observed in transgenic lines that over accumulated zinc. In a confined field trial five transgenic events grown for 12 months showed a range of zinc concentrations from 18 to 217 mg/kg DW. Although the overexpression of zinc transporters was successful in increasing the zinc concentrations in 25% of the transgenic lines generated, it also resulted in a decrease in plant and tuber size and overall yield due to what appears to be zinc deficiency in the aerial parts of the plant. © 2015 Gaitán-Solís, Taylor, Siritunga, Stevens and Schachtman.","Cassava; Deficiency; Plant; Storage root; Zinc; Zinc transporters","Arabidopsis thaliana; Manihot esculenta",,,,,,"Becher, M., Talke, I.N., Krall, L., Kramer, U., Cross-species microarray transcript profiling reveals high constitutive expression of metal homeostasis genes in shoots of the zinc hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri (2004) Plant J, 37, pp. 251-268; Broadley, M., Brown, P., Cakmak, I., Rengel, Z., Zao, F., Function of nutrients: Micronutrients (2012) Marschner's Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants, pp. 191-248. , 3rd Edn, ed.

This obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen attacks both leaf and berry, greatly affecting yield and quality. To investigate possible mechanisms of nutrient acquisition by successful biotrophs, we characterized a candidate NITRATE TRANSPORTER1/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER FAMILY (NPF, formerly NRT1/PTR) member, grapevine NFP3.2, that was up-regulated in E. necator-inoculated susceptible V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon leaves, but not in resistant V. aestivalis Norton. Expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements showed that VvNPF3.2 is a low-affinity transporter for both nitrate and nitrite and displays characteristics of NPF members from other plants. We also cloned the Arabidopsis ortholog, AtNPF3.1, and showed that AtNPF3.1 similarly transported nitrate and nitrite with low affinity. With an Arabidopsis triple mutant that is susceptible to E. necator, we found that AtNPF3.1 is up-regulated in the leaves of infected Arabidopsis similarly to VvNPF3.2 in susceptible grapevine leaves. Expression of the reporter β-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the promoter of VvNPF3.2 or AtNPF3.1 in Arabidopsis indicated that both transporters are expressed in vascular tissue, with expression in major and minor veins, respectively. Interestingly, the promoter of VvNPF3.2 allowed induced expression of GUS in minor veins in PM-infected leaves. Our experiments lay the groundwork for investigating the manipulation of host nutrient distribution by biotrophic pathogens and characterizing physiological variables in the pathogenesis of this difficult to study grapevine disease. © 2013 The Author.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Erysiphe necator; Nitrate transporters; Powdery mildew; Vitis aestivalis; Vitis vinifera","anion transport protein; messenger RNA; nitrate transporters; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; article; Ascomycetes; Erysiphe necator; gene expression regulation; genetics; grape; metabolism; microbiology; mutation; pH; physiology; plant disease; plant leaf; powdery mildew; sequence homology; transgenic plant; transport at the cellular level; Vitis; Vitis aestivalis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Erysiphe necator; Nitrate transporters; Powdery mildew; Vitis aestivalis; Vitis vinifera; Anion Transport Proteins; Arabidopsis; Ascomycota; Biological Transport; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mutation; Nitrates; Nitrites; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Vitis","GENBANK: KF649633","nitrite, 14797-65-0",,,,"Aslam, M., Travis, R.L., Huffaker, R.C., Comparative kinetics and reciprocal inhibition of nitrate and nitrite uptake in roots of uninduced and induced barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings (1992) Plant Physiol., 99, pp. 1124-1133; Ayres, P.G., Press, M.C., Spencer-Phillips, P.T.N., Effects of pathogens and parasitic plants on source-sink relationships (1996) Photoassimilate Distribution in Plants and Crops, pp. 479-499. , Edited by Zamski, E. and Schaffer, A.A., Marcel Decker Inc, New York; Bannai, H., Tamada, Y., Maruyama, O., Nakai, K., Miyano, S., Extensive feature detection of N-terminal protein sorting signals (2002) Bioinformatics, 18, pp. 298-305; Chandran, D., Inada, N., Hather, G., Kleindt, C.K., Wildermuth, M.C., Laser microdissection of Arabidopsis cells at the powdery mildew infection site reveals site-specific processes and regulators (2010) Proc.

More recently evolved root mutualisms have recruited components of the AM signalling pathway as identified with molecular approaches in model legume research. Earlier we reported that the reduced mycorrhizal colonisation (rmc) mutation of tomato mapped to chromosome 8. Here we report additional functional characterisation of the rmc mutation using genotype grafts and proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Our results led to identification of the precise genome location of the Rmc locus from which we identified the mutation by sequencing. The rmc phenotype results from a deletion that disrupts five predicted gene sequences, one of which has close sequence match to the CYCLOPS/IPD3 gene identified in legumes as an essential intracellular regulator of both AM and rhizobial symbioses. Identification of two other genes not located at the rmc locus but with altered expression in the rmc genotype is also described. Possible roles of the other four disrupted genes in the deleted region are discussed. Our results support the identification of CYCLOPS/IPD3 in legumes and rice as a key gene required for AM symbiosis. The extensive characterisation of rmc in comparison with its 'parent' 76R, which has a normal mycorrhizal phenotype, has validated these lines as an important comparative model for glasshouse and field studies of AM and non-mycorrhizal plants with respect to plant competition and microbial interactions with vascular plant roots. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis; Common Sym pathway; Fast neutron mutagenesis; Solanum lycopersicum; The Tomato Genome Consortium","arbuscular mycorrhiza; chromosome; gene expression; genome; mutation; phenotype; root system; vascular plant; vegetable; Arbuscular; Embryophyta; Lycopersicon esculentum; Tracheophyta; vegetable protein; article; Fabaceae; fungus; genetics; microbiology; mutation; mycorrhiza; physiology; symbiosis; tomato; Fabaceae; Fungi; Lycopersicon esculentum; Mutation; Mycorrhizae; Plant Proteins; Symbiosis",,,,,"#DP0342496, ARC, Australian Research Council","Alabouvette, C., Olivain, C., Migheli, Q., Steinberg, C., Microbiological control of soil-borne phytopathogenic fungi with special emphasis on wilt-inducing Fusarium oxysporum (2009) New Phytol, 184, pp. 529-544. , doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03014.x; Ané, J.M., Kiss, G.B., Riely, B.K., Penmetsa, R.V., Oldroyd, G.E.D., Ayax, C., Levy, J., Kalo, P., Medicago truncatula dmi1 required for bacterial and fungal symbioses in legumes (2004) Science, 303, pp. 1364-1367. , doi:10.1126/science.1092986; Barker, S.J., Stummer, B., Gao, L., Dispain, I., O'Connor, P.J., Smith, S.E., A mutant in Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. with highly reduced VA mycorrhizal colonization: isolation and preliminary characterisation (1998) Plant J, 15, pp. 791-797; Barker, S.J., Edmonds-Tibbett, T.L., Forsyth, L., Klingler, J.P., Toussaint, J.-P., Smith, F.A., Smith, S.E., Root infection of the reduced mycorrhizal colonization (rmc) mutant of tomato reveals genetic interaction between symbiosis and parasitism (2006) Physiol Molec Plant Path, 67, pp. 277-283. , doi:10.1016/j.pmpp.2006.03.003; Berkelman, T., Stenstedt, T., (1998) 2-D Electrophoresis, , Piscataway: Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Bournival, B.L., Scott, J.W., Vallejos, C.E., An isozyme marker for resistance to race 3 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici in tomato (1989) Theor Appl Genet, 78, pp. 489-494. , doi:10.1007/BF00290832; Bradford, M.M., A rapid and sensitive method for quantitation of micro gram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding (1976) Anal Bioch, 72, pp. 248-254. , doi:10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-3; Cavagnaro, T.R., Smith, F.A., Lorimer, M.F., Haskard, K.A., Ayling, S.A., Smith, S.E., Quantitative development of Paris-type arbuscular mycorrhizas formed between Asphodelus fistulosus and Glomus coronatum (2001) New Phytol, 149, pp. 105-113. , doi:10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00001.x; Cavagnaro, T.R., Smith, F.A., Hay, G., Carne-Cavagnaro, V.L., Smith, S.E., Inoculum type does not affect overall resistance of arbuscular mycorrhiza-defective tomato mutant to colonisation but inoculation does change competitive interactions with wild-type tomato (2004) New Phytol, 161, pp. 485-494. , doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.00967.x; Cavagnaro, T.R., Jackson, L.E., Six, J., Ferris, H., Goyal, S., Asami, D., Scow, K.M., Arbuscular mycorrhizas, microbial communities, nutrient availability, and soil aggregates in organic tomato production (2006) Plant Soil, 282, pp. 209-225. , doi:10.1007/s11104-005-5847-7; Cavagnaro, T.R., Sokolow, S.K., Jackson, L.E., Mycorrhizal effects on growth and nutrition of tomato under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (2007) Functl Plant Biol, 34, pp. 730-736. , doi:10.1071/FP06340; Cavagnaro, T.R., Langley, A.J., Jackson, L.E., Smukler, S.M., Koch, G.W., Growth, nutrition, and soil respiration of a mycorrhiza-defective tomato mutant and its mycorrhizal wild-type progenitor (2008) Functl Plant Biol, 35, pp. 228-235. , doi:10.1071/FP07281; Cavagnaro, T.R., Barrios-Masias, F.H., Jackson, L.E., Arbuscular mycorrhizas and their role in plant growth, nitrogen interception and soil gas efflux in an organic production system (2012) Plant Soil, 353, pp. 181-194. , doi:10.1007/s11104-011-1021-6; Duc, G., Trouvelot, A., Gianinazzi-Pearson, V., Gianinazzi, S., First report of non-mycorrhizal plant mutants (myc-) obtained in pea (Pisum sativum L.) and fababean (Vicia faba L.)

Most land plants can associate with this specialized group of soil fungi (in the Glomeromycota), which enhance plant nutrient uptake in return for C derived from plant photosynthesis. Elucidating the mechanisms involved in the symbiosis between obligate symbionts such as AM fungi and plant roots is challenging because AM fungal transcripts in roots are in low abundance and reference genomes for the fungi have not been available. A deep sequencing metatranscriptomics approach was applied to a wild-type tomato and a tomato mutant (Solanum lycopersicum L. cultivar RioGrande 76R) incapable of supporting a functional AM symbiosis, revealing novel AM fungal and microbial transcripts expressed in colonized roots. We confirm transcripts known to be mycorrhiza associated and report the discovery of more than 500 AM fungal and novel plant transcripts associated with mycorrhizal tomato roots including putative Zn, Fe, aquaporin, and carbohydrate transporters as well as mycorrhizal-associated alternative gene splicing. This analysis provides a fundamental step toward identifying the molecular mechanisms of mineral and carbohydrate exchange during the symbiosis. The utility of this metatranscriptomic approach to explore an obligate biotrophic interaction is illustrated, especially as it relates to agriculturally relevant biological processes. © Crop Science Society of America.",,,,,,,,"Allen, J.W., Shachar-Hill, Y., Sulfur transfer through an arbuscular mycorrhiza (2009) Plant Physiol, 149, pp. 549-560. , doi:10.1104/ pp.108.129866; Aroca, R., Vernieri, P., Ruiz-Lozano, J.M., Mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Lactuca sativa plants exhibit contrasting responses to exogenous ABA during drought stress and recovery (2008) J.

HAK5, an Arabidopsis high-affinity K transporter gene, plays an important role in K uptake. Its expression is up-regulated in response to K deprivation and is rapidly down-regulated when sufficient K levels have been re-established. To identify transcription factors regulating HAK5, an Arabidopsis TF FOX (Transcription Factor Full-length cDNA Over-eXpressor) library containing approximately 800 transcription factors was used to transform lines previously transformed with a luciferase reporter gene whose expression was driven by the HAK5 promoter. When grown under sufficient K levels, 87 lines with high luciferase activity were identified, and endogenous HAK5 expression was confirmed in 27 lines. Four lines overexpres-sing DDF2 (Dwarf and Delayed Flowering 2), JLO (Jagged Lateral Organs), TFII-A (Transcription initiation Factor II-A gamma chain) and bHLH121 (basic Helix-Loop-Helix 121) were chosen for further characterization by luciferase activity, endogenous HAK5 level and root growth in K-deficient conditions. Further analysis showed that the expression of these transcription factors increased in response to low K and salt stress. In comparison with controls, root growth under low K conditions was better in each of these four TF FOX lines. Activation of HAK5 expression by these four transcription factors required at least 310bp of upstream sequence of the HAK5 promoter. These results indicate that at least these four transcription factors can bind to the HAK5 promoter in response to K limitation and activate HAK5 expression, thus allowing plants to adapt to nutrient stress. © The Author 2013.","Arabidopsis TFs FOX; HAK5; Potassium-deficient signaling","Arabidopsis protein; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; beta glucuronidase; bHLH121 protein, Arabidopsis; cotransporter; DDF2 protein, Arabidopsis; JAGGED LATERAL ORGANS protein, Arabidopsis; luciferase; potassium; potassium transporter, Arabidopsis; repressor protein; sodium chloride; transcription factor; transcription factor II; transcription initiation factor IIA subunit 2, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis TFs FOX; article; gene expression regulation; genetics; HAK5; metabolism; Potassium-deficient signaling; promoter region; protein binding; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis TFs FOX; HAK5; Potassium-deficient signaling; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucuronidase; Luciferases; Plants, Genetically Modified; Potassium; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; Repressor Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sodium Chloride; Symporters; Transcription Factors; Transcription Factors, TFII",,"beta glucuronidase, 9001-45-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5",,,"2200509, JSPS, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","Ahn, S.J., Shin, R., Schachtman, D.P., Expression of KT/KUP genes in arabidopsis and the role of root hairs in K+ uptake (2004) Plant Physiol., 134, pp. 1135-1145; Amberg, D.C., Burke, D.J., Strathern, J.N., High-efficiency transformation of yeast (2006) Cold Spring Harbor Protoc.; An, S.Y., Park, S., Jeong, D.H., Lee, D.Y., Kang, H.G., Yu, J.H., Generation and analysis of end sequence database for T-DNA tagging lines in rice (2003) Plant Physiol., 133, pp. 2040-2047; Aoyama, T., Chua, N.H., A glucocorticoid-mediated tran-scriptional induction system in transgenic plants (1997) Plant J., 11, pp. 605-612; Armengaud, P., Breitling, R., Amtmann, A., The potassium-dependent transcriptome of arabidopsis reveals a prominent role of jasmonic acid in nutrient signaling (2004) Plant Physiol., 136, pp. 2556-2576; Armengaud, P., Sulpice, R., Miller, A.J., Stitt, M., Amtmann, A., Gibon, Y., Multilevel analysis of primary metabolism provides new insights into the role of potassium nutrition for glycolysis and nitrogen assimilation in arabidopsis roots (2009) Plant Physiol., 150, pp. 772-785; Ashley, M.K., Grant, M., Grabov, A., Plant responses to potassium deficiencies: A role for potassium transport proteins (2006) J.

These processes are coordinated with photosynthesis and the carbon status of the plant. Here, we present the characterization of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Conquistador') plants engineered to overexpress an intragenic gain-of-function allele of the type I proton translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The proton-pumping and inorganic pyrophosphate hydrolytic activities of these plants are augmented compared with control plants. Immunohistochemical data show a conspicuous increase in H+-PPase protein abundance at the vasculature of the transgenic plants. Transgenic plants displayed an enhanced rhizosphere acidification capacity consistent with the augmented plasma membrane H+-ATPase proton transport values, and ATP hydrolytic capacities evaluated in vitro. These transgenic lines outperform control plants when challenged with NO3- limitations in laboratory, greenhouse, and field scenarios. Furthermore, we report the characterization of a lettuce LsNRT2.1 gene that is constitutive up-regulated in the transgenic plants. Of note, the expression of the LsNRT2.1 gene in control plants is regulated by NO3- and sugars. Enhanced accumulation of 15N-labeled fertilizer by transgenic lettuce compared with control plants was observed in greenhouse experiments. A negative correlation between the level of root soluble sugars and biomass is consistent with the strong root growth that characterizes these transgenic plants. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Root-knot nematodes induce the formation of a highly specialized feeding site consisting of several giant cells surrounded by a network of vascular tissues. Nutrients, including amino acids and sugars, are transferred apoplastically from the vascular tissues to the feeding site. Using Arabidopsis thaliana lacking the vascular-expressed amino acid permeases (AAP) AAP3 or AAP6, we demonstrate that disruption of amino acid transport can affect nematode parasitism. Nematode infestation levels are significantly reduced on the aap3 and aap6 mutants. AAP3 and AAP6 act distinctly in the transport of amino acids to the feeding site, as demonstrated by differences in their carrying capacity profiles. Furthermore, analyses of promoter: β-glucuronidase lines show different expression patterns for AAP3 and AAP6 in infected roots. In the aap3-3 mutant, part of the decrease in infestation is connected to a defect in early infection, where juveniles enter but then leave the root. Both aap3-3 and aap6-1 produce fewer females and produce more adult male nematodes. Additionally, detrimental effects are observed in the nematodes harvested from aap3-3 and aap6-1 mutants, including decreased egg hatching and infectivity and lower levels of lipid reserves. The transport of amino acids by AAP3 and AAP6 is important for nematode infection and success of the progeny. © 2013 The American Phytopathological Society.",,"AAP3 protein, Arabidopsis; AAP6 protein, Arabidopsis; amino acid; amino acid transporter; Arabidopsis protein; plant RNA; animal; Arabidopsis; article; female; genetics; growth, development and aging; host parasite interaction; lipid metabolism; male; metabolism; mutation; parasite identification; parasitology; physiology; plant disease; plant leaf; tobacco; transgenic plant; transport at the cellular level; Tylenchoidea; Amino Acid Transport Systems; Amino Acid Transport Systems, Basic; Amino Acids; Animals; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biological Transport; Female; Host-Parasite Interactions; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mutation; Parasite Egg Count; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA, Plant; Tobacco; Tylenchoidea; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Meloidogyne; Meloidogyne incognita; Meloidogyne javanica; Nematoda",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; AAP3 protein, Arabidopsis; AAP6 protein, Arabidopsis; Amino Acid Transport Systems; Amino Acid Transport Systems, Basic; Amino Acids; Arabidopsis Proteins; RNA, Plant",,,,"Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Kim, C.J., Chen, H., Shinn, P., Stevenson, D.K., Ecker, J.R., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Ashrafi, K., Chang, F.Y., Watts, J.L., Fraser, A.G., Kamath, R.S., Ahringer, J., Ruvkun, G., Genome-wide rnai analysis of caenorhabditis elegans fat regulatory genes (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 268-272; Barcala, M., García, A., Cabrera, J., Casson, S., Lindsey, K., Favery, B., García-Casado, G., Escobar, C., Early transcriptomic events in microdissected arabidopsis nematode-induced giant cells (2010) Plant J., 61, pp. 698-712; Bird, D.M., Signaling between nematodes and plants (2004) Curr.

The transcription factor RAP2.11 was identified as a component in the response to low potassium through regulation of the high-affinity K+ uptake transporter AtHAK5 and other components of the low-potassium signal transduction pathway. RAP2.11 was identified through the activation tagging of Arabidopsis lines that contained a luciferase marker driven by the AtHAK5 promoter that is normally only induced by low potassium. This factor bound to a GCC-box of the AtHAK5 promoter in vitro and in vivo. Transcript profiling revealed that a large number of genes were up-regulated in roots by RAP2.11 overexpression. Many regulated genes were identified to be in functional categories that are important in low-K+ signaling. These categories included ethylene signaling, reactive oxygen species production, and calcium signaling. Promoter regions of the up-regulated genes were enriched in the GCCGGC motif also contained in the AtHAK5 promoter. These results suggest that RAP2.11 regulates AtHAK5 expression under low-K+ conditions and also contributes to a coordinated response to low-potassium conditions through the regulation of other genes in the low-K+ signaling cascade. © The Author 2012.

Connecting the molecular study of the AM symbiosis with agriculturally- and ecologically-relevant field environments remains a challenge and is a largely unexplored research topic. Methods: This study utilized a cross-disciplinary approach to examine the transcriptional, metabolic, and physiological responses of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) AM roots to a localized patch of nitrogen (N). A wild-type mycorrhizal tomato and a closely-related non-mycorrhizal mutant were grown at an organic farm in soil that contained an active AM extraradical hyphal network and soil microbe community. Results: The majority of genes regulated by upon enrichment of nitrogen were similarly expressed in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots, suggesting that the primary response to an enriched N patch is mediated by mycorrhiza-independent root processes. However where inorganic N concentrations in the soil were low, differential regulation of key tomato N transport and assimilation genes indicate a transcriptome shift towards mycorrhiza-mediated N uptake over direct root supplied N. Furthermore, two novel mycorrhizal-specific tomato ammonium transporters were also found to be regulated under low N conditions. A conceptual model is presented integrating the transcriptome response to low N and highlighting the mycorrhizal-specific ammonium transporters. Conclusions: These results enhance our understanding of the role of the AM symbiosis in sensing and response to an enriched N patch, and demonstrate that transcriptome analyses of complex plant-microbe-soil interactions provide a global snapshot of biological processes relevant to soil processes in organic agriculture. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Mycorrhizal symbiosis; Nitrogen metabolism; Plant-microbe-soil interaction; Root transcriptome; Tomato","agricultural practice; ammonium; arbuscular mycorrhiza; concentration (composition); fertilizer; field method; fruit; fungus; gene expression; metabolism; molecular analysis; mutation; nitrogen; numerical model; nutrient uptake; pesticide; physiological response; rhizosphere; root; soil microorganism; symbiosis; wild population; Arbuscular; Fungi; Lycopersicon esculentum; Solanum",,,,,,"Allen, J.W., Shachar-Hill, Y., Sulfur transfer through an arbuscular mycorrhiza (2009) Plant Physiol, 149, pp. 549-560; Aono, T., Maldonado-Mendoza, I.E., Dewbre, G.R., Harrison, M.J., Saito, M., Expression of alkaline phosphatase genes in arbuscular mycorrhizas (2004) New Phytol, 162, pp. 525-534; Asghari, H.R., Chittleborough, D.J., Smith, F.A., Smith, S.E., Influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis on phosphorus leaching through soil cores (2005) Plant and Soil, 275, pp. 181-193; Banerjee, R., Evande, R., Kabil, Ã., Ojha, S., Taoka, S., Reaction mechanism and regulation of cystathionine Î 2-synthase (2003) Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta- Proteins and Proteomics, 1647, pp. 30-35; Barker, S.J., Stummer, B., Gao, L., Dispain, I., O'Connor, P.J., Smith, S.E., A mutant in Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. with highly reduced VA mycorrhizal colonization: Isolation and preliminary characterisation (1998) Plant J, 15, pp. 791-797; Bevan, M., Bancroft, I., Bent, E., Love, K., Goodman, H., Dean, C., Bergkamp, R., Chalwatzis, N., Analysis of 1.9 Mb of contiguous sequence from chromosome 4 of Arabidopsis thaliana (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 485-488; Blee, K.A., Anderson, A.J., Regulation of arbuscule formation by carbon in the plant (1998) Plant J, 16, pp. 523-530; Blilou, I., Ocampo, J.A., García-Garrido, J.M., Resistance of pea roots to endomycorrhizal fungus or Rhizobium correlates with enhanced levels of endogenous salicylic acid (1999) J Exp Bot, 50, pp. 1663-1668; Blilou, I., Ocampo, J.A., García-Garrido, J.M., Induction of LTP (lipid transfer protein) and Pal (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) gene expression in rice roots colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae (2000) J Exp Bot, 51, pp. 1969-1977; Bloom, A.J., Meyerhoff, P.A., Taylor, A.R., Rost, T.L., Root development and absorption of ammonium and nitrate from the rhizosphere (2002) J Plant Growth Regul, 21, pp. 416-431; Bruce, A., Smith, S.E., Tester, M., The development of mycorrhizal infection in cucumber: effects of P supply on root growth, formation of entry points and growth of infection units (1994) New Phytol, 127, pp. 507-514; Bucher, M., Functional biology of plant phosphate uptake at root and mycorrhiza interfaces (2007) New Phytol, 173, pp. 11-26; Burger, M., Jackson, L.E., Plant and microbial nitrogen use and turnover: rapid conversion of nitrate to ammonium in soil with roots (2005) Plant and Soil, 266, pp. 289-301; Burger, M., Jackson, L.E., Lundquist, E.J., Louie, D.T., Miller, R.L., Rolston, D.E., Scow, K.M., Microbial responses and nitrous oxide emissions during wetting and drying of organically and conventionally managed soil under tomatoes (2005) Biol Fertil Soils, 42, pp. 109-118; Cavagnaro, T.R., Jackson, L.E., Six, J., Ferris, H., Goyal, S., Asami, D., Scow, K.M., Arbuscular mycorrhizas, microbial communities, nutrient availability, and soil aggregates in organic tomato production (2006) Plant and Soil, 282, pp. 209-225; Cavagnaro, T.R., Langley, A.J., Jackson, L.E., Smukler, S.M., Koch, G.W., Growth, nutrition, and soil respiration of a mycorrhiza-defective tomato mutant and its mycorrhizal wild-type progenitor (2008) Funct Plant Biol, 35, pp. 228-235; Conyers, M.K., Moody, P.W., A conceptual framework for improving the P efficiency of organic farming without inputs of soluble P fertiliser (2009) Crop and Pasture Science, 60, pp. 100-104; Cruz, C., Egsgaard, H., Trujillo, C., Ambus, P., Requena, N., Martins-Loução, M.A., Jakobsen, I., Enzymatic evidence for the key role of arginine in nitrogen translocation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (2007) Plant Physiol, 144, pp. 782-792; Fitter, A.H., Helgason, T., Hodge, A., Nutritional exchanges in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis: implications for sustainable agriculture (2011) Fungal Biology Reviews, 25, pp. 68-72; Foster, J.C., Soil nitrogen (1995) Methods in Applied Soil Microbiology and Biochemistry, pp. 79-87. , K.

To reduce input costsñand to minimize the potential environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilizer that has been used to optimize yield, an increasedñunderstanding of the molecular responses to nitrogen under field conditions is critical for our ability to further improveñagricultural sustainability. Using maize (Zea mays) as a model, we have characterized the transcriptional response of plantsñgrown under limiting and sufficient nitrogen conditions and during the recovery of nitrogen-starved plants. We show that añlarge percentage (approximately 7%) of the maize transcriptome is nitrogen responsive, similar to previous observations inñother plant species. Furthermore, we have used statistical approaches to identify a small set of genes whose expression profilesñcan quantitatively assess the response of plants to varying nitrogen conditions. Using a composite gene expression scoringñsystem, this single set of biomarker genes can accurately assess nitrogen responses independently of genotype, developmentalñstage, tissue type, or environment, including in plants grown under controlled environments or in the field. Importantly, theñbiomarker composite expression response is much more rapid and quantitative than phenotypic observations. Consequently,ñwe have successfully used these biomarkers to monitor nitrogen status in real-time assays of field-grown maize plants underñtypical production conditions. Our results suggest that biomarkers have the potential to be used as agronomic tools to monitorñand optimize nitrogen fertilizer usage to help achieve maximal crop yields. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.

A typical cassava-based diet, however, provides less than 30% of the minimum daily requirement for protein and only 10%â€""20% of that for iron, zinc, and vitamin A. The BioCassava Plus (BC+) program has employed modern biotechnologies intended to improve the health of Africans through the development and delivery of genetically engineered cassava with increased nutrient (zinc, iron, protein, and vitamin A) levels. Additional traits addressed by BioCassava Plus include increased shelf life, reductions in toxic cyanogenic glycosides to safe levels, and resistance to viral disease. The program also provides incentives for the adoption of biofortified cassava. Proof of concept was achieved for each of the target traits. Results from field trials in Puerto Rico, the first confined field trials in Nigeria to use genetically engineered organisms, and ex ante impact analyses support the efficacy of using transgenic strategies for the biofortification of cassava.

Previous findings suggest a connection between three 14-3-3 isoforms and plant nutrient signaling. To better understand how these 14-3-3s regulate metabolism in response to changes in plant nutrient status, putative new targets involved in nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) metabolisms have been identified. The interactions between these 14-3-3s and multiple proteins involved in N and S metabolism and altered activity of the target proteins were confirmed in planta.

As soils become dry, root-sourced signals are transported via the xylem to leaves. Nitrate is thought to play a role in modifying root to shoot signaling under drought. We present new data on experiments that used nitrate and ammonium nutrition to modify xylem sap pH. The changes in xylem sap composition in maize grown under either nitrate or ammonium nutrition were comprehensively measured. Our analysis of these results suggests a new hypothesis in which many of the changes in xylem sap composition are due to charge balance needing to be achieved when different types of solutes are transported into the xylem.

We have recently reported that expression of ABA biosynthetic genes in roots only increases in the later stage of water stress. Our results support the hypothesis that in early water stress, increased levels of ABA in xylem sap are due to leaf biosynthesis and translocation to roots and from there to xylem. If so, other xylem-borne chemicals may be the primary stress signal(s) inducing ABA biosynthesis in leaves. We found that apart from ABA, sulfate was the only xylem-borne chemical that consistently showed higher concentrations from early to later water stress. We also found increased expression of a sulfate transporter gene in roots from early water stress onwards. Moreover, using bioassays we found an interactive effect of ABA and sulfate in decreasing maize transpiration rate, as compared to ABA alone. While ABA is undoubtedly the key mediator of water stress responses such as stomatal closure, it may not be the primary signal produced by roots perceiving water stress. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.","Aba biosynthesis;

To gain more insight into the role of root-sourced ABA, the timing and location of the expression of genes for key enzymes involved in ABA biosynthesis in Zea mays roots was measured and a comprehensive analysis of root xylem sap constituents from the early to the later stages of water stress was conducted. Xylem sap and roots were sampled from plants at an early stage of water stress when only a reduction in leaf conductance was measured, as well as at later stages when leaf xylem pressure potential decreased. It was found that the majority of ABA biosynthetic genes examined were only significantly expressed in the elongation region of roots at a later stage of water stress. Apart from ABA, sulphate was the only xylem-borne chemical that consistently showed significantly higher concentrations from the early to the later stages of stress. Moreover, there was an interactive effect of ABA and sulphate in decreasing maize transpiration rate and Vicia faba stomatal aperture, as compared to ABA alone. The expression of a sulphate transporter gene was also analysed and it was found that it had increased in the elongation region of roots from the early to the later stages of water stress. Our results support the suggestion that in the early stage of water stress, increased levels of ABA in xylem sap may not be due to root biosynthesis, ABA glucose ester catabolism or pH-mediated redistribution, but may be due to shoot biosynthesis and translocation to the roots. The analysis of xylem sap mineral content and bioassays indicate that the anti-transpirant effect of the ABA reaching the stomata at the early stages of water stress may be enhanced by the increased concentrations of sulphate in the xylem which is also transported from the roots to the leaves. © 2010 The Author(s).","ABA biosynthesis; Abscisic acid; Corn; Drought; pH; Stomatal conductance; Sulphate; Water stress; Zea mays","abscisic acid; plant RNA; sulfate; water; abscisic acid; soil; sulfate; article; biosynthesis; chemistry; dehydration; enzymology; evapotranspiration; genetics; maize; metabolism; plant leaf; plant root; signal transduction; soil; transport at the cellular level; xylem; analysis; biosynthesis; chemistry; maize; plant root; soil; xylem; Abscisic Acid; Biological Transport; Dehydration; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Transpiration; RNA, Plant; Signal Transduction; Soil; Sulfates; Water; Xylem; Zea mays; Vicia faba; Zea mays; Abscisic Acid; Biological Transport; Dehydration; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Transpiration; RNA, Plant; Signal Transduction; Soil; Sulfates; Water; Xylem; Zea mays",,"abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; sulfate, 14808-79-8; water, 7732-18-5; Abscisic Acid, 21293-29-8; RNA, Plant; Soil; Sulfates; Water, 7732-18-5; Abscisic Acid; RNA, Plant; Soil; Sulfates; Water",,,,"Alvarez, S., Goodger, J.Q.D., Marsh, E.L., Chen, S.X., Asirvatham, V.S., Schachtman, D.P., Characterization of the maize xylem sap proteome (2006) Journal of Proteome Research, 5, pp. 963-972; Alvarez, S., Marsh, E.L., Schroeder, S.G., Schachtman, D.P., Metabolomic and proteomic changes in the xylem sap of maize under drought (2008) Plant, Cell and Environment, 31, pp. 325-340; Assmann, S.M., Shimazaki, K.I., The multisensory guard cell.

Studies in solution culture over-simplify the complex soil environment where microbial competition and spatial and temporal heterogeneity challenge roots' ability to acquire adequate amounts of nutrients required for plant growth. In this study, various ammonium treatments (as 15N) were applied to a discrete volume of soil containing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots to simulate encounters with a localized enriched patch of soil. Transcriptome analysis was used to identify genes differentially expressed in roots 53 hrs after treatment.Results: The ammonium treatments resulted in significantly higher concentrations of both ammonium and nitrate in the patch soil. The plant roots and shoots exhibited increased levels of 15N over time, indicating a sustained response to the enriched environment. Root transcriptome analysis identified 585 genes differentially regulated 53 hrs after the treatments. Nitrogen metabolism and cell growth genes were induced by the high ammonium (65 μg NH 4 +-N g -1soil), while stress response genes were repressed. The complex regulation of specific transporters following the ammonium pulse reflects a simultaneous and synergistic response to rapidly changing concentrations of both forms of inorganic N in the soil patch. Transcriptional analysis of the phosphate transporters demonstrates cross-talk between N and phosphate uptake pathways and suggests that roots increase phosphate uptake via the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in response to N.Conclusion: This work enhances our understanding of root function by providing a snapshot of the response of the tomato root transcriptome to a pulse of ammonium in a complex soil environment. This response includes an important role for the mycorrhizal symbiosis in the utilization of an N patch. © 2010 Ruzicka et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Arbuscular; Lycopersicon esculentum; Solanum; nitrogen; phosphate transporter; quaternary ammonium derivative; article; cell division; cell wall; cytology; DNA microarray; drug effect; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; physiological stress; plant gene; plant root; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; soil; tomato; Cell Division; Cell Wall; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Lycopersicon esculentum; Nitrogen; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phosphate Transport Proteins; Plant Roots; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Soil; Stress, Physiological; Transcription, Genetic",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Phosphate Transport Proteins; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Soil",,,,"Burger, M., Jackson, L.E., Microbial immobilization of ammonium and nitrate in relation to ammonification and nitrification rates in organic and conventional cropping systems (2003) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 35, pp. 29-36; Booth, M.S., Stark, J.M., Rastetter, E., Controls on nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems: A synthetic analysis of literature data (2005) Ecological Monographs, 75, pp. 139-157; Schimel, J.P., Bennett, J., Nitrogen mineralization: Challenges of a changing paradigm (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 591-602; Hodge, A., The plastic plant: root responses to heterogeneous supplies of nutrients (2004) New Phytologist, 162, pp. 9-24; Granato, T.C., Raper, C.D., Proliferation of maize (Zea mays L) roots in response to localized supply of nitrate (1989) Journal of Experimental Botany, 40, pp. 263-275. , 10.1093/jxb/40.2.263, 11542157; Garnett, T., Conn, V., Kaiser, B.N., Root based approaches to improving nitrogen use efficiency in plants (2009) Plant, Cell and Environment, 32, pp. 1272-1283; Tibbett, M., Roots foraging and the exploration of soil nutrient patches: the role of the mycorrhizal symbiosis (2000) Functional Ecology, 14, pp. 397-399; Cavagnaro, T.R., Jackson, L.E., Six, J., Ferris, H., Goyal, S., Asami, D., Scow, K.M., Arbuscular mycorrhizas, microbial communities, nutrient availability, and soil aggregates in organic tomato production (2006) Plant and Soil, 282, pp. 209-225; Lea, P.J., Azevedo, R.A., Nitrogen use efficiency. 1.

Activation-tagged lines of Arabidopsis plants containing the AtHAK5 promoter driving luciferase were screened for bioluminescence under potassium-sufficient conditions. A member of the type III peroxidase family, RCI3, was isolated and when it was overexpressed by the activation tag, this led to the enhanced expression of luciferase and the endogenous AtHAK5. RCI3 was found to be up-regulated upon potassium deprivation. Plants overexpressing RCI3 (RCI3-ox) showed more ROS production and AtHAK5 expression whereas the ROS production and AtHAK5 expression were reduced in rci3-1 under K+-deprived conditions. These results suggested that RCI3 is involved in the production of ROS under potassium deprivation and that RCI3-mediated ROS production affects the regulation of AtHAK5 expression. This peroxidase appears to be another component of the low-potassium signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis roots.","Abiotic/environmental stress; Arabidopsis; Nutrition; Peroxidase; ROS production; Signal transduction","Arabidopsis protein; cotransporter; peroxidase; potassium; potassium transporter, Arabidopsis; RCI3 protein, Arabidopsis; reactive oxygen metabolite; Arabidopsis; article; cell wall; endoplasmic reticulum; genetics; metabolism; plant root; polymerase chain reaction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Wall; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Peroxidases; Plant Roots; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Potassium; Reactive Oxygen Species; Symporters; Arabidopsis",,"peroxidase, 9003-99-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; Arabidopsis Proteins; Peroxidases, 1.11.1.-; Potassium, 7440-09-7; RCI3 protein, Arabidopsis, 1.11.1-; Reactive Oxygen Species; Symporters; potassium transporter, Arabidopsis",,,,"Ahn, S.J., Shin, R., Schachtman, D.P., Expression of KT/ KUP genes in Arabidopsis and the role of root hairs in K+ uptake (2004) Plant Physiol, 134, pp. 1135-1145; Allan, A.C., Fluhr, R., Two distinct sources of elicited reactive oxygen species in tobacco epidermal cells (1997) Plant Cell, 9, pp. 1559-1572; Apel, K., Hirt, H., Reactive oxygen species: Metabolism, oxidative stress, and signal transduction (2004) Annu.

In this study, we identified and characterized a new Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein, Nuclear Protein X1 (NPX1), which was up-regulated by stress and treatment with exogenous ABA. Stomatal closure, seed germination, and primary root growth are well-known ABA responses that were less sensitive to ABA in NPX1-overexpressing plants. NPX1-overexpressing plants were more drought sensitive, and the changes in response to drought were due to the altered guard cell sensitivity to ABA in transgenic plants and not to a lack of ABA production. The nuclear localization of NPX1 correlated with changes in the expression of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and ABA signal transduction. To understand the function of NPX1, we searched for interacting proteins and found that an ABA-inducible NAC transcription factor, TIP, interacted with NPX1. Based on the whole plant phenotypes, we hypothesized that NPX1 acts as a transcriptional repressor, and this was demonstrated in yeast, where we showed that TIP was repressed by NPX1. Our results indicate that the previously unknown protein NPX1 acts as a negative regulator in plant response to changes in environmental conditions through the control of ABA-regulated gene expression. The characterization of this factor enhances our understanding of guard cell function and the mechanisms that plants use to modulate water loss from leaves under drought conditions. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"abscisic acid; Arabidopsis protein; nuclear protein; phytohormone; plant DNA; transcription factor; Arabidopsis; article; DNA microarray; drought; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; germination; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular cloning; physiological stress; plant root; two hybrid system; Abscisic Acid; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Plant; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germination; Nuclear Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Roots; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; Abscisic Acid, 21293-29-8; Arabidopsis Proteins; DNA, Plant; Nuclear Proteins; Plant Growth Regulators; Transcription Factors",,,,"Abe, H., Urao, T., Ito, T., Seki, M., Shinozaki, K., Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K., Arabidopsis AtMYC2 (bHLH) and AtMYB2 (MYB) function as transcriptional activators in abscisic acid signaling (2003) Plant Cell, 15, pp. 63-78; Adie, B.A., Perez-Perez, J., Perez-Perez, M.M., Godoy, M., Sanchez-Serrano, J.J., Schmelz, E.A., Solano, R., ABA is an essential signal for plant resistance to pathogens affecting JA biosynthesis and the activation of defenses in Arabidopsis (2007) Plant Cell, 19, pp. 1665-1681; Aida, M., Ishida, T., Fukaki, H., Fujisawa, H., Tasaka, M., Genes involved in organ separation in Arabidopsis: An analysis of the cup-shaped cotyledon mutant (1997) Plant Cell, 9, pp. 841-857; Assmann, S.M., OPEN STOMATA1 opens the door to ABA signaling in Arabidopsis guard cells (2003) Trends Plant Sci, 8, pp. 151-153; Chen, Y., Ji, F., Xie, H., Liang, J., Overexpression of the regulator of G-protein signalling protein enhances ABA-mediated inhibition of root elongation and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis (2006) J Exp Bot, 57, pp. 2101-2110; Christmann, A., Weiler, E.W., Steudle, E., Grill, E., A hydraulic signal in root-to-shoot signalling of water shortage (2007) Plant J, 52, pp. 167-174; Clough, S.J., Bent, A.F., Floral dip: A simplified method for Agro-bacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana (1998) Plant J, 16, pp. 735-743; Collinge, M., Boller, T., Differential induction of two potato genes, Stprx2 and StNAC, in response to infection by Phytophthora infestans and to wounding (2001) Plant Mol Biol, 46, pp. 521-529; Earley, K.W., Haag, J.R., Pontes, O., Opper, K., Juehne, T., Song, K., Pikaard, C.S., Gateway-compatible vectors for plant functional genomics and proteomics (2006) Plant J, 45, pp. 616-629; Fujita, M., Fujita, Y., Maruyama, K., Seki, M., Hiratsu, K., Ohme-Takagi, M., Tran, L.S., Shinozaki, K., A dehydration-induced NAC protein, RD26, is involved in a novel ABA-dependent stress-signaling pathway (2004) Plant J, 39, pp. 863-876; Fujita, M., Fujita, Y., Noutoshi, Y., Takahashi, F., Narusaka, Y., Yamaguchi-shinozaki, K., Shinozaki, K., Crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress responses: A current view from the points of convergence in the stress signaling networks (2006) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 9, pp. 436-442; Fujita, Y., Fujita, M., Satoh, R., Maruyama, K., Parvez, M.M., Seki, M., Hiratsu, K., Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K., AREB1 is a transcription activator of novel ABRE-dependent ABA signaling that enhances drought stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (2005) Plant Cell, 17, pp. 3470-3488; Furihata, T., Maruyama, K., Fujita, Y., Umezawa, T., Yoshida, R., Shinozaki, K., Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K., Abscisic acid-dependent multisite phosphorylation regulates the activity of a transcription activator AREB1 (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 1988-1993; Gollery, M., Harper, J., Cushman, J., Mittler, T., Girke, T., Zhu, J.K., Bailey-Serres, J., Mittler, R., What makes species unique?

This suggests a highly adept mechanism of parasitism which enables powdery mildews to avoid detection or evade defenses by their host. To better understand this plant-pathogen interaction, we employed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), differential hybridization and quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR for the identification of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) genes that were specifically up-regulated in response to the grape powdery mildew Erysiphe necator Schwein. We identified 25 grapevine transcripts that increased in abundance upon infection in leaves of the susceptible host V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite the compatible interaction between the pathogen and plant, several of the E. necator-induced transcripts represented typical defense response genes. Among the transcripts identified were those that encoded a leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine kinase-like receptor, an MYB transcription factor, and two ubiquitination-associated proteins, indicating the stimulation of intracellular signal transduction and regulatory functions. A number of genes characteristic of senescence processes, including metallothioneins, a deoxyribonuclease, an aspartyl protease and a subtilase-like serine protease, also were identified. These transcripts expanded the list of previously identified E. necator-responsive grapevine genes and facilitated a more comprehensive view of the molecular events that underlie this economically important plant-pathogen interaction. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Defense;

The signalling events may be unique to higher plants, as they lack animal purinoceptor homologues. Although it is known that plant cytosolic free Ca 2+ can be elevated by extracellular ATP, the mechanism is unknown. Here, we have studied roots of Arabidopsis thaliana to determine the events that lead to the transcriptional stress response evoked by extracellular ATP. Root cell protoplasts were used to demonstrate that signalling to elevate cytosolic free Ca2+ is determined by ATP perception at the plasma membrane, and not at the cell wall. Imaging revealed that extracellular ATP causes the production of reactive oxygen species in intact roots, with the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase AtRBOHC being the major contributor. This resulted in the stimulation of plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels (determined using patch-clamp electrophysiology), which contribute to the elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+. Disruption of this pathway in the AtrbohC mutant impaired the extracellular ATP-induced increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of Ca2+ channels, and the transcription of the MAP kinase3 gene that is known to be involved in stress responses. This study shows that higher plants, although bereft of purinoceptor homologues, could have evolved a distinct mechanism to transduce the ATP signal at the plasma membrane. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adenosine triphosphate; Calcium; Channel; MAP kinase; Reactive oxygen species","adenosine triphosphate; Arabidopsis protein; calcium; calcium channel; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; Arabidopsis; article; calcium signaling; cell membrane; metabolism; plant root; Adenosine Triphosphate; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium; Calcium Channels; Calcium Signaling; Cell Membrane; NADPH Oxidase; Plant Roots; Reactive Oxygen Species; Animalia; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Embryophyta","GENBANK: AF055355","adenosine triphosphate, 15237-44-2, 56-65-5, 987-65-5; calcium, 7440-70-2; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, 9032-22-8; Adenosine Triphosphate, 56-65-5; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium, 7440-70-2; Calcium Channels; NADPH Oxidase, 1.6.3.1; Reactive Oxygen Species",,,,"Able, A.J., Guest, D.I., Sutherland, M.W., Use of a new tetrazolium-based assay to study the production of superoxide radicals by tobacco cell cultures challenged with avirulent zoospores of Phytophthora parasitica var nicotianae (1998) Plant Physiology, 117 (2), pp. 491-499; Apel, K., Hirt, H., Reactive oxygen species: Metabolism, oxidative stress, and signal transduction (2004) Annual Review of Plant Biology, 55, pp. 373-399. , DOI 10.1146/annurev.arplant.55.031903.141701; Bienert, G.P., Moller, A.L.B., Kristiansen, K.A., Schulz, A., Moller, I.M., Schjoerring, J.K., Jahn, T.P., Specific aquaporins facilitate the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide across membranes (2007) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 282 (2), pp. 1183-1192. , http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/282/2/1183, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M603761200; Bolwell, G.P., Wojtaszek, P., Mechanisms for the generation of reactive oxygen species in plant defence - A broad perspective (1997) Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology, 51 (6), pp. 347-366. , DOI 10.1006/pmpp.1997.0129; Carol, R.J., Takeda, S., Linstead, P., Durrant, M.C., Kakesova, H., Derbyshire, P., Drea, S., Dolan, L., A RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor spatially regulates growth in root hair cells (2005) Nature, 438 (7070), pp. 1013-1016. , DOI 10.1038/nature04198, PII NATURE04198; Chivasa, S., Ndimba, B.K., Simon, W.J., Robertson, D., Yu, X.-L., Knox, J.P., Bolwell, P., Slabas, A.R., Proteomic analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana cell wall (2002) Electrophoresis, 23 (11), pp. 1754-1765. , DOI 10.1002/1522-2683(200206)23:11<1754::AID-ELPS1754>3.0.CO;2-E; Chivasa, S., Ndimba, B.K., Simon, W.J., Extracellular ATP functions as an endogenous external metabolite regulating plant cell viability (2005) Plant Cell, 17, pp. 3019-3034; Demidchik, V., Bowen, H.C., Maathuis, F.J.M., Shabala, S.N., Tester, M.A., White, P.J., Davies, J.M., Arabidopsis thaliana root non-selective cation channels mediate calcium uptake and are involved in growth (2002) Plant Journal, 32 (5), pp. 799-808. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-313X.2002.01467.x; Demidchik, V., Nichols, C., Oliynyk, M., Dark, A., Glover, B.J., Davies, J.M., Is ATP a Signaling Agent in Plants?

How plants sense and transduce the stress signals initiated by potassium deprivation is poorly understood. Both ethylene production and the transcription of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis increase when plants are deprived of potassium. To elucidate the role of ethylene in low potassium signaling pathways, we used both genetic and chemical approaches. Our results showed that ethylene is important in tolerance to low potassium and for changes in both root hair and primary root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that ethylene acts upstream of reactive oxygen species in response to potassium deprivation. The expression of High-Affinity K + Transporter5 was used as a marker of potassium deprivation and was found to be dependent on ethylene signaling. In the ethylene insensitive2-1 (ein2-1) mutant, the ethylene-mediated low potassium responses were not completely eliminated, suggesting that some potassium deprivation-induced responses are either ethylene independent or EIN2 independent. Ethylene signaling is a component of the plant's response to low potassium that stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species and is important for changes in root morphology and whole plant tolerance to low potassium conditions. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"aminoethoxyvinylglycine; Arabidopsis protein; cotransporter; drug derivative; ethylene; ethylene derivative; glycine; potassium; potassium transporter, Arabidopsis; reactive oxygen metabolite; silver; Arabidopsis; article; biosynthesis; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiological stress; plant root; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Ethylenes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glycine; Plant Roots; Potassium; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Silver; Stress, Physiological; Symporters; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"aminoethoxyvinylglycine, 73360-07-3; ethylene, 74-85-1; glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; potassium, 7440-09-7; silver, 7440-22-4; Arabidopsis Proteins; Ethylenes; Glycine, 56-40-6; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Reactive Oxygen Species; Silver, 7440-22-4; Symporters; aminoethoxyvinylglycine, 49669-74-1; ethylene, 74-85-1; potassium transporter, Arabidopsis",,,,"Achard, P., Cheng, H., De Grauwe, L., Decat, J., Schoutteten, H., Moritz, T., Van Der Straeten, D., Harberd, N.P., Integration of plant responses to environmentally activated phytohormonal signals (2006) Science, 311, pp. 91-94; Achard, P., Vriezen, W.H., Van Der Straeten, D., Harberd, N.P., Ethylene regulates arabidopsis development via the modulation of DELLA protein growth repressor function (2003) Plant Cell, 15, pp. 2816-2825; Ahn, S.J., Shin, R., Schachtman, D.P., Expression of KT/ KUP genes in Arabidopsis and the role of root hairs in K + uptake (2004) Plant Physiol, 134, pp. 1135-1145; Armengaud, P., Breitling, R., Amtmann, A., The potassiumdependent transcriptome of Arabidopsis reveals a prominent role of jasmonic acid in nutrient signaling (2004) Plant Physiol, 136, pp. 2556-2576; Ashley, M.K., Grant, M., Grabov, A., Plant responses to potassium deficiencies: A role for potassium transport proteins (2006) J.

We describe how the hormone auxin, which originates from the developing lateral root, acts as a local inductive signal which re-programmes adjacent cells. Auxin induces the expression of a previously uncharacterized auxin influx carrier LAX3 in cortical and epidermal cells directly overlaying new primordia. Increased LAX3 activity reinforces the auxin-dependent induction of a selection of cell-wall-remodelling enzymes, which are likely to promote cell separation in advance of developing lateral root primordia.",,"auxin; carrier protein; protein lax3; Arabidopsis; article; cell separation; cell wall; controlled study; epidermis cell; nonhuman; oocyte; plant cell; plant root; plant tissue; primordium; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; Xenopus; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Indoleacetic Acids; Membrane Transport Proteins; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Roots",,"carrier protein, 80700-39-6; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Indoleacetic Acids; LAX3 protein, Arabidopsis; Membrane Transport Proteins; Plant Growth Regulators",,,,"Casimiro, I., Auxin transport promotes Arabidopsis lateral root initiation (2001) Plant Cell, 13, pp. 843-852; Dubrovsky, J.G., Early primordium morphogenesis during lateral root initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana (2001) Planta, 214, pp. 30-36; Malamy, J.E., Benfey, P.N., Organisation and cell differentiation in lateral roots of Arabidopsisthaliana (1997) Development, 124, pp. 33-44; Lloret, P.G., Casero, R.J., Lateral root initiation (2002) Plant roots: The hidden half, , eds.

As soils become dry, root-sourced signals are transported via the xylem to leaves and result in reduced water loss and decreased leaf growth. The presence of chemical signals in xylem sap is accepted, but the identity of these signals is controversial. Abscisic acid (ABA), pH, cytokinins, a precursor of ethylene, malate and other unidentified factors have all been implicated in root to shoot signaling under drought. This review describes current knowledge of, and advances in, research on chemical signals that are sent from roots under drought. The contribution of these different potential signals is discussed within the context of their role in stress signaling. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous work showed that the maize primary root adapts to low w (-1.6 MPa) by maintaining longitudinal expansion in the apical 3 mm (region 1), whereas in the adjacent 4 mm (region 2) longitudinal expansion reaches a maximum in well-watered roots but is progressively inhibited at low w. To identify mechanisms that determine these responses to low w, transcript expression was profiled in these regions of water-stressed and well-watered roots. In addition, comparison between region 2 of water-stressed roots and the zone of growth deceleration in well-watered roots (region 3) distinguished stress-responsive genes in region 2 from those involved in cell maturation. Results. Responses of gene expression to water stress in regions 1 and 2 were largely distinct. The largest functional categories of differentially expressed transcripts were reactive oxygen species and carbon metabolism in region 1, and membrane transport in region 2. Transcripts controlling sucrose hydrolysis distinguished well-watered and water-stressed states (invertase vs. sucrose synthase), and changes in expression of transcripts for starch synthesis indicated further alteration in carbon metabolism under water deficit. A role for inositols in the stress response was suggested, as was control of proline metabolism. Increased expression of transcripts for wall-loosening proteins in region 1, and for elements of ABA and ethylene signaling were also indicated in the response to water deficit. Conclusion. The analysis indicates that fundamentally different signaling and metabolic response mechanisms are involved in the response to water stress in different regions of the maize primary root elongation zone.",,"Zea mays; water; article; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; maize; metabolism; plant root; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plant Roots; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Water; Zea mays",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,,"Nguyen, H.

Some of these compounds are vital for signalling and adaptation to environmental stress such as drought. In this study, we screened the xylem sap using mass spectrometry to quantify the changes in new and previously identified sap constituents under extended drought. We detected and quantified the changes in the concentration of 31 compounds present in the xylem sap under progressively increasing drought stress. We found changes in the hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin, and the presence of high concentrations of the aromatic cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). Several phenylpropanoid compounds (coumaric, caffeic and ferulic acids) were found in xylem sap. The concentrations of some of these phenylpropanoid compounds changed under drought. In parallel, an analysis of the xylem sap proteome was conducted. We found a higher abundance of cationic peroxidases, which with the increase in phenylpropanoids may lead to a reduction in lignin biosynthesis in the xylem vessels and could induce cell wall stiffening. The application of new methodologies provides insights into the range of compounds in sap and how alterations in composition may lead to changes in development and signalling during adaptation to drought. © 2008 The Authors.","Abscisic acid; Cytokinins; LC-MS/MS; Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM); Peroxidases; Phenylpropanoids","proteome; vegetable protein; water; abscisic acid; abundance; adaptation; drought stress; maize; metabolism; shoot; xylem; article; cell culture; disaster; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; maize; metabolism; pH; plant; plant root; proteomics; signal transduction; time; xylem; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Natural Disasters; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Proteome; Proteomics; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Water; Xylem; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"water, 7732-18-5; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Alvarez, S., Goodger, J.Q., Marsh, E.L., Chen, S., Asirvatham, V.S., Schachtman, D.P., Characterization of the maize xylem sap proteome (2006) Journal of Proteome Research, 5, pp. 963-972; Bahrun, A., Jensen, C.R., Asch, F., Mogensen, V.O., Drought-induced changes in xylem pH, ionic composition, and ABA concentration act as early signals in field-grown maize (Zea mays L.)

Warson Road, St Louis, MO 63132, United States","Caesium (Cs+) is a potentially toxic mineral element that is released into the environment and taken up by plants. Although Cs+ is chemically similar to potassium (K+), and much is known about K + transport mechanisms, it is not clear through which K+ transport mechanisms Cs+ is taken up by plant roots. In this study, the role of AtHAK5 in high affinity K+ and Cs+ uptake was characterized. It is demonstrated that AtHAK5 is localized to the plasma membrane under conditions of K+ deprivation, when it is expressed. Growth analysis showed that AtHAK5 plays a role during severe K+ deprivation. Under K+-deficient conditions in the presence of Cs +, Arabidopsis seedlings lacking AtHAK5 had increased inhibition of root growth and lower Cs+ accumulation, and significantly higher leaf chlorophyll concentrations than wild type. These data indicate that, in addition to transporting K+ in planta, AtHAK5 also transports Cs +. Further experiments showed that AtHAK5 mediated Cs+ uptake into yeast cells and that, although the K+ deficiency-induced expression of AtHAK5 was inhibited by low concentrations of NH4 + in planta, Cs+ uptake by yeast was stimulated by low concentrations of NH4 +. Interestingly, the growth of the Arabidopsis atakt1-1 mutant was more sensitive to Cs+ than the wild type. This may be explained, in part, by increased expression of AtHAK5 in the atakt1-1 mutant. It is concluded that AtHAK5 is a root plasma membrane uptake mechanism for K+ and Cs+ under conditions of low K + availability. © The Author [2008].

Burr., but little is known about the transcriptional basis of the defense to PM. Our microscopic observations showed that PM produced less hyphal growth and induced more brown-colored epidermal cells on leaves of PM-resistant Vitis aestivalis 'Norton' than on leaves of PM-susceptible Vitis vinifera 'Cabernet sauvignon'. We found that endogenous salicylic acid levels were higher in V. aestivalis than in V. vinifera in the absence of the fungus and that salicylic acid levels increased in V. vinifera at 120 h postinoculation with PM. To test the hypothesis that gene expression differences would be apparent when V. aestivalis and V. vinifera were mounting a response to PM, we conducted a comprehensive Vitis GeneChip analysis. We examined the transcriptome at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h postinoculation with PM. We found only three PM-responsive transcripts in V. aestivalis and 625 in V. vinifera. There was a significant increase in the abundance of transcripts encoding ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, WRKY, PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1, PATHOGENESIS-RELATED10, and stilbene synthase in PM-infected V. vinifera, suggesting an induction of the basal defense response. The overall changes in the PM-responsive V. vinifera transcriptome also indicated a possible reprogramming of metabolism toward the increased synthesis of the secondary metabolites. These results suggested that resistance to PM in V. aestivalis was not associated with overall reprogramming of the transcriptome. However, PM induced defense-oriented transcriptional changes in V. vinifera. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"article; Ascomycetes; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation;

To gain a comprehensive understanding of how cell wall protein (CWP) composition changes in association with the differential growth responses to water deficit in different regions of the elongation zone, a proteomics approach was used to examine water soluble and loosely ionically bound CWPs. The results revealed major and predominantly region-specific changes in protein profiles between well-watered and water-stressed roots. In total, 152 water deficit-responsive proteins were identified and categorized into five groups based on their potential function in the cell wall: reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, defense and detoxification, hydrolases, carbohydrate metabolism, and other/unknown. The results indicate that stress-induced changes in CWPs involve multiple processes that are likely to regulate the response of cell elongation. In particular, the changes in protein abundance related to ROS metabolism predicted an increase in apoplastic ROS production in the apical region of the elongation zone of water-stressed roots. This was verified by quantification of hydrogen peroxide content in extracted apoplastic fluid and by in situ imaging of apoplastic ROS levels. This response could contribute directly to the enhancement of wall loosening in this region. This large-scale proteomic analysis provides novel insights into the complexity of mechanisms that regulate root growth under water deficit conditions and highlights the spatial differences in CWP composition in the root elongation zone. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Plant cell culture; Proteins; Solubility; Water; Cell wall protein (CWP) composition; Proteomics approach; Water deficit; Water-stressed roots; Crops; proteome; reactive oxygen metabolite; vegetable protein; water; adaptation; article; cell enlargement; cell wall; growth, development and aging; maize; metabolism; physiology; plant root; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Adaptation, Physiological; Cell Enlargement; Cell Wall; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Proteome; Reactive Oxygen Species; Water; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"water, 7732-18-5; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Reactive Oxygen Species; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Apel, K., Hirt, H., Reactive oxygen species: Metabolism, oxidative stress, and signal transduction (2004) Annu Rev Plant Biol, 55, pp. 373-399; Bayer, E.M., Bottrill, A.R., Walshaw, J., Vigouroux, M., Naldrett, M.J., Thomas, C.L., Maule, A.J., Arabidopsis cell wall proteome defined using multidimensional protein identification technology (2006) Proteomics, 6, pp. 301-311; Bendtsen, J.D., Jensen, L.J., Blom, N., von Heijne, G., Brunak, S., Feature-based prediction of non-classical and leaderless protein secretion (2004) Protein Eng Des Sel, 17, pp. 349-356; Blee, K.A., Wheatley, E.R., Bonham, V.A., Mitchell, G.P., Robertson, D., Slabas, A.R., Burrell, M.M., Bolwell, G.P., Proteomic analysis reveals a novel set of cell wall proteins in a transformed tobacco cell culture that synthesises secondary walls as determined by biochemical and morphological parameters (2001) Planta, 212, pp. 404-415; Boudart, G., Jamet, E., Rossignol, M., Lafitte, C., Borderies, G., Jauneau, A., Esquerre-Tugaye, M.T., Pont-Lezica, R., Cell wall proteins in apoplastic fluids of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes: Identification by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics (2005) Proteomics, 5, pp. 212-221; Boyer, J.S., Knipling, E.B., Isopiestic technique for measuring leaf water potentials with a thermocouple psychrometer (1965) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 54, pp. 1044-1051; Chivasa, S., Ndimba, B.K., Simon, W.J., Robertson, D., Yu, X.L., Knox, J.P., Bolwell, P., Slabas, A.R., Proteomic analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana cell wall (2002) Electrophoresis, 23, pp. 1754-1765; Cho, H.T., Kende, H., Expansins and internodal growth of deepwater rice (1997) Plant Physiol, 113, pp. 1145-1151; Dani, V., Simon, W.J., Duranti, M., Croy, R.R.D., Changes in the tobacco leaf apoplast proteome in response to salt stress (2005) Proteomics, 5, pp. 737-745; Dracup, M., Gibbs, J., Greenway, H., Melibiose, a suitable, nonpermeating osmoticum for suspension-cultured tobacco cells (1986) J Exp Bot, 37, pp. 1079-1089; Fan, L., Linker, R., Gepstein, S., Tanimoto, E., Yamamoto, R., Neumann, P.M., Progressive inhibition by water deficit of cell wall extensibility and growth along the elongation zone of maize roots is related to increased lignin metabolism and progressive stelar accumulation of wall phenolics (2006) Plant Physiol, 140, pp. 603-612; Fan, L., Neumann, P.M., The spatially variable inhibition by water deficit of maize root growth correlates with altered profiles of proton flux and cell wall pH (2004) Plant Physiol, 135, pp. 2291-2300; Ferry-Dumazet, H., Houel, G., Montalent, P., Moreau, L., Langella, O., Negroni, L., Vincent, D., Plomion, C., PROTICdb: Aweb-based application to store, track, query, and compare plant proteome data (2005) Proteomics, 5, pp. 2069-2081; Fry, S.C., (1988) The Growing Plant Cell Wall: Chemical and Metabolic Analysis, , Longman Scientific & Technical, Harlow, UK; Fry, S.C., Oxidative scission of plant cell wall polysaccharides by ascorbate-induced hydroxyl radicals (1998) Biochem J, 332, pp. 507-515; Fry, S.C., Dumville, J.C., Miller, J.G., Fingerprinting of polysaccharides attacked by hydroxyl radicals in vitro and in the cell walls of ripening pear fruit (2001) Biochem J, 357, pp. 729-737; Fry, S.C., Smith, R.C., Renwick, K.F., Martin, D.J., Hodge, S.K., Matthews, K.J., Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, a new wall-loosening enzyme activity from plants (1992) Biochem J, 282, pp. 821-828; Gross, G.G., Cell wall-bound malate dehydrogenase from horseradish (1977) Phytochemistry, 16, pp. 319-321; Hartung, W., Sauter, A., Hose, E., Abscisic acid in the xylem: Where does it come from, where does it go to?

These studies rely on sophisticated equipment and methodologies including confocal fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography that are beyond the scope of traditional laboratory courses. To equip the advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students with an enabling base of knowledge and initial experience with advanced protein research methodologies, a laboratory course entitled Plant Cells and Proteins was developed in a partnership between Washington University and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis. In this one semester course, 10-12 students obtain hands-on experience with plant tissue culture, gene transformation, subcellular localization of fluorescent recombinant proteins using confocal microscopy, purification of affinity-tagged recombinant proteins, isolation of total protein extracts, enzymatic assays, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF and ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry, protein crystallization, and X-ray diffraction. The course is taught as a series of modules, each led by an expert researcher. Students are evaluated based on a series of graded written reports and tests of their mastery of key concepts, interpretations, and the limitations of the experimental methods. © 2007 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.","Fundamental skills; Graduate; Interdisciplinary; Teaching laboratory; Undergraduate","article; cellular distribution; confocal microscopy; course content; cytology; education program; enzyme assay; fluorescence microscopy; gel electrophoresis; genetic transformation; graduate student; human; mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; molecular biology; plant cell; protein function; protein purification; proteomics; teaching; tissue culture; X ray crystallography; X ray diffraction",,,,,,"Eberhardt, E.S., Hansen, J., Riservato, L., Cole, M., Smaglo, B., Szaniawski, P., Preparing undergraduates to participate in the post-genome era: A capstone laboratory experience in proteomics (2003) Biochem.

Approximately 12% of the genes were differentially expressed in the two grapevine species (P < 0.001). Over 200 probe sets were identified which consistently detected transcripts in one grapevine species, but not in the other. We were unable to identify any broad functional category in which transcript abundance was overall different in any one species. Of the genes expressed only in V. aestivalis leaves, we identified a class IV chitinase which was previously shown by others to have a flower- and fruit-specific expression in V. vinifera. Among the transcripts which were differentially expressed (P < 0.001) in both species, we identified genes encoding key enzymes in flavonoid, monolignol, and proanthocyanindin biosynthesis. Statistical exploration of the data suggested that sequence divergence between the predominantly V. vinifera-derived GeneChip probes and the V. aestivalis cRNA did not confound the hybridization data and that the reliability of the microarray results was similar in the two grapevine species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Chitinase; Gene expression; Grapevine; Microarray; Phenylpropanoid metabolism; Species-specificity; Transcriptome; Vitis vinifera","comparative study; cultivar; dicotyledon; enzyme activity; gene expression; genetic analysis; genomics; hybridization; leaf; organic nitrogen compound; Vitaceae; Vitis; Vitis aestivalis; Vitis vinifera",,,,,,"Adam-Blondon, A.-F., Genome sequencing projects: Strategies and perspectives (2006) 9th International Conference on Grape Genetics and Breeding, , Paper presented at the University of Udine, Italy, 2-6 July 2006; Adam-Blondon, A.-F., Aubourg, S., Guichard, C., Pelsy, F., This, P., Paillard, S., Rathnaparkhe, M., Weissenbach, J., Update of our knowledge on the structure of the grapevine genome (2005) Proceedings of the International Grape Genomics Symposium, , Qiu WP, Kovács LG (eds) Saint Louis, 2005; (2001) Microarray Suite User's Guide, , http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manuals.affx, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, Cited 22 May 2006; (2002) Statistical Algorithm Description Document, , http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper. pdf, Affymetrix, Sanat Clara, California, Cited 22 May 2006; (2004) Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual, , http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, Cited 22 May 2006; Alleweldt, G., Spiegel-Roy, P., Reisch, B.J., Grapes (Vitis) (1990) Genetic Resources of Temperate Fruit and Nut Crops, 290, pp. 291-337. , Moore JN, Ballington JR (eds) ISHS, Wageningen, The Netherlands; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J Mol Biol, 215, pp. 403-410; Aradhya, M.K., Dangl, G.S., Prins, B.H., Bourisqou, J.M., Walker, M.A., Meredith, C.P., Simon, C.J., Genetic structure and differentiation in cultivated grape Vitis vinifera L (2003) Genet Res, 81, pp. 179-192; Barker, C.L., Donald, T., Pauquet, J., Ratnaparkhe, M.B., Bouquet, A., Adam-Blondon, A.-F., Thomas, M.R., Dry, I., Genetic and physical mapping of the grapevine powdery mildew resistance gene, Run1, using a bacterial artificial chromosome library (2005) Theor Appl Genet, 111, pp. 370-377; Bieza, K., Lois, R., An Arabidopsis mutant tolerant to lethal ultraviolet-B levels shows constitutively elevated accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolics (2001) Plant Physiol, 126, pp. 1105-1115; Bisson, L.F., Waterhouse, A.L., Ebeler, S.E., Walker, M.A., Lapsley, J.T., The present and future of the international wine industry (2002) Nature, 418, pp. 696-699; Derckel, J.P., Legendre, L., Audren, J., Haye, B., Lambert, B., Chitinases of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.): Five isoforms induced in leaves by salicylic acid are constitutively expressed in other tissues (1996) Plant Sci, 119, pp. 31-37; Dixon, R.A., Xie, D.Y., Sharma, S.B., Proanthocyanidins - A final frontier in flavonoid research?

In this study, we report a new Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor, MYB77, that is involved in auxin response. In MYB77 knockout plants, we found that auxin-responsive gene expression was greatly attenuated. Lateral root density in the MYB77 knockout was lower than the wild type at low concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and also under low nutrient conditions. MYB77 interacts with auxin response factors (ARFs) in vitro through the C terminus (domains III and IV) of ARFs and the activation domain of MYB77. A synergistic genetic interaction was demonstrated between MYB77 and ARF7 that resulted in a strong reduction in lateral root numbers. Experiments with protoplasts confirmed that the coexpression of MYB77 and an ARF C terminus enhance reporter gene expression. R2R3 MYB transcription factors have not been previously implicated in regulating the expression of auxin-inducible genes. Also it was previously unknown that ARFs interact with proteins other than those in the Aux/IAA family via conserved domains. The interaction between MYB77 and ARFs defines a new type of combinatorial transcriptional control in plants. This newly defined transcription factor interaction is part of the plant cells' repertoire for modulating response to auxin, thereby controlling lateral root growth and development under changing environmental conditions. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Arabidopsis thaliana; Auxin; Genetic interactions; Plant development; Plant hormones; Environmental impact; Genes; Growth kinetics; Hormones; Nutrients; Signal transduction; Transcription factors; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis protein; ARF7 protein, Arabidopsis; indoleacetic acid derivative; Myb77 protein, Arabidopsis; transcription factor; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis; article; chemistry; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; plant root; protein binding; protoplast; reporter gene; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Reporter; Indoleacetic Acids; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Protein Binding; Protoplasts; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"ARF7 protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Indoleacetic Acids; Myb77 protein, Arabidopsis; Transcription Factors",,,,"Abel, S., Nguyen, M., Theologis, A., The PS-IAA4/5-like family of early auxin-inducible mRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana (1995) J.

To adapt and grow in nutrient-deprived environments plants must sense changes in external and internal mineral nutrient concentrations and adjust growth to match resource availability. The sensing and signal transduction networks that control plant responses to nutrient deprivation are not well characterized for nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur deprivation. One branch of the signal transduction cascade related to phosphorus-deprivation response has been defined through the identification of a transcription factor that is regulated by sumoylation. Two different microRNAs play roles in regulating gene expression under phosphorus and sulfur deprivation. Reactive oxygen species increase rapidly after mineral nutrient deprivation and may be one upstream mediator of nutrient signaling. A number of molecular analyses suggest that both short-term and longer-term responses will be important in understanding the progression of signaling events when the external, then internal, supplies of nutrients become depleted.

The uptake mechanism is probably facilitated by a proton gradient generated by proton H +-ATPases. We investigated expression of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. H+-ATPases in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants to determine if any are specifically regulated in response to colonization. Tissue expression and cellular localization of H+-ATPases were determined by RNA gel blot analysis and in situ hybridization of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots. LHA1, LHA2, and LHA4 had high levels of expression in roots and were expressed predominantly in epidermal cells. LHA1 and LHA4 were also expressed in cortical cells containing arbuscules. The presence of arbuscules in root sections was correlated with lower levels of expression of these two isoforms in the epidermis. These results suggest that LHA1 and LHA4 expression is decreased in epidermal cells located in regions of the root that contain arbuscules. This provides evidence of differential regulation between molecular mechanisms involved in proton-coupled nutrient transfer either from the soil or fungus to the plant. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; ATPase; In situ hybridization; Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato)","plant RNA; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; arbuscular mycorrhiza; colonization; enzyme; gene expression; hybridization; vegetable; article; enzymology; gene; gene expression; genetics; growth, development and aging; microbiology; mycorrhiza; symbiosis; tomato; Gene Expression; Genes, Plant; Lycopersicon esculentum; Mycorrhizae; Proton-Translocating ATPases; RNA, Plant; Symbiosis; Arbuscular; Fungi; Lycopersicon esculentum",,"Proton-Translocating ATPases, EC 3.6.3.14; RNA, Plant",,,,"Agresti, A., Coull, B.A., Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions (1998) Am Stat, 52, pp. 119-126; Baxter, I., Tchieu, J., Sussman, M.R., Boutry, M., Palmgren, M.G., Gribskov, M., Harper, J.F., Axelsen, K.B., Genomic comparison of P-type ATPase ion pumps in Arabidopsis and rice (2003) Plant Physiol, 132, pp. 618-628; Benabdellah, K., Azcon-Aguilar, C., Ferrol, N., Plasma membrane ATPase and H+ transport activities in microsomal membranes from mycorrhizal tomato roots (1999) J Exp Bot, 50, pp. 1343-1349; Blilou, I., Bueno, P., Ocampo, J.A., Garcia-Garrido, J., Induction of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities in tobacco roots inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal Glomus mosseae (2000) Mycol Res, 104, pp. 722-725; Bonanomi, A., Oetiker, J.H., Guggenheim, R., Boller, T., Wiemken, A., Vögeli-Lange, R., Arbuscular mycorrhizas in mini-mycorrhizotrons: First contact of Medicago truncatula roots with Glomus intraradices induces chalcone synthase (2001) New Phytol, 150, pp. 573-582; Colwell, J.D., The estimation of phosphorous fertilizer requirements of wheat in southern N.S.W. by soil analysis (1963) Aust J Exp Agric Anim Husb, 3, pp. 190-197; Ewing, N.N., Bennett, A.B., Assessment of the number and expression of P-type H+-ATPase genes in tomato (1994) Plant Physiol, 106, pp. 547-557; Ewing, N.N., Wimmers, L.E., Meyer, D.J., Chetelat, R.T., Bennett, A.B., Molecular cloning of tomato plasma membrane H+-ATPase (1990) Plant Physiol, 94, pp. 1874-1881; Ferrol, N., Pozo, M.J., Antelo, M., Azcon-Aguilar, C., Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis regulates plasma membrane H+-ATPase gene expression in tomato plants (2002) J Exp Bot, 53, pp. 1683-1687; Gao, L.L., Knogge, W., Delp, G., Smith, F.A., Smith, S.E., Expression patterns of defense-related genes in different types of arbuscular mycorrhizal development in wild-type and mycorrhiza-defective mutant tomato (2004) Mol Plant Microbe Interact, 17, pp. 1103-1113; Gianinazzi-Pearson, V., Smith, S.E., Gianinazzi, S., Smith, F.A., Enzymatic studies on the metabolism of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas, V.

When this kinase is over expressed in Arabidopsis, the plants grow larger. To understand how this kinase modulates growth, we identified some of the proteins that are phosphorylated by this kinase. A new phosphoproteomic method was used in which total protein from plants overexpressing the kinase was compared with total protein from plants in which the kinase was inactivated. Protein profiles were compared on two-dimensional gels following staining by a dye that recognizes phosphorylated amino acids. Candidate target proteins were confirmed with in vitro phosphorylation assays, using the kinase and target proteins that were purified from Escherichia coli. Seven target proteins were confirmed as being phosphorylated by SnRK2.8. Certain targets, such as 14-3-3 proteins, regulate as yet unidentified proteins, whereas other targets, such as glyoxalase I and ribose 5-phosphate isomerase, detoxify byproducts from glycolysis and catalyze one of the final steps in carbon fixation, respectively. Also, adenosine kinase and 60S ribosomal protein were confirmed as targets of SnRK2.8. Using mass spectrometry, we identified phosphorylated residues in the SnRK2.8, the 14-3-3κ, and the 14-3-3χ. These data show that the expression of SnRK2.8 is correlated with plant growth, which may in part be due to the phosphorylation of enzymes involved in metabolic processes. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","14-3-3;

Amino acid transporters in plants often show tissue-specific expression patterns and are used by plants to transport these metabolites from source to sink during development and under changing environmental conditions. We identified one amino acid transporter, AtCAT6, which is expressed in sink tissues such as lateral root primordia, flowers and seeds. Additionally AtCAT6 was induced during infestation of roots by the plant-parasitic root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed nematode inducibility throughout the duration of nematode infestation and in nematode-induced feeding sites. Promoter analyses confirmed expression in endogenous sink tissues and nematode-induced feeding sites. In Xenopus oocytes, AtCAT6 mediated electrogenic transport of proteinogenic as well as non-proteinogenic amino acids with moderate affinity. AtCAT6 transported large, neutral and cationic amino acids in preference to other amino acids. Knockout mutants of this transporter failed to grow on medium containing l-glutamine as the sole nitrogen source. Our data suggest that AtCAT6 plays a role in supplying amino acids to sink tissues of plants and nematode-induced feeding structures. © 2006 The Authors.","Amino acid transporter; Essential amino acid; Meloidogyne incognita; Nematode; Pathogen interaction; Sink tissue","Amino acid transporter; Essential amino acids; Meloidogyne incognita; Pathogen interaction; Sink tissue; Amino acids; Enzyme kinetics; Mutagenesis; Seed; Tissue; Plants (botany); carrier protein; essential amino acid; primer DNA; animal; Arabidopsis; article; enzyme specificity; kinetics; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; physiology; polymerase chain reaction; transport at the cellular level; Xenopus laevis; Amino Acids, Essential; Animals; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Biological Transport; Carrier Proteins; DNA Primers; Kinetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Substrate Specificity; Xenopus laevis; Amino Acids; Enzymatic Activity; Flowers; Pathogens; Plants; Seeds; Tissue; Worms; Arabidopsis; Meloidogyne incognita; Meloidogyne javanica",,"carrier protein, 80700-39-6; Amino Acids, Essential; Carrier Proteins; DNA Primers",,,,"Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Bird, A.F., The ultrastructure and histochemistry of a nematode-induced giant cell (1961) J.

Warson Rd, St Louis, MO 63132, United States","Potassium accumulation is essential for grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) growth and development, but excessive levels in berries at harvest may reduce wine quality particularly for red wines. In addition to decreasing the free acid levels, potassium also combines with tartaric acid to form largely insoluble potassium bitartrate. This precipitates during winemaking and storage, resulting in an increase in wine pH that is associated with negative impacts on wine colour, flavour, and microbiological stability. For these reasons, a better understanding of potassium transport and accumulation within the vine and berries is important for producing fruit with improved winemaking characteristics. Here two genes encoding KUP/KT/HAK-type potassium transporters that are expressed in grape berries are described. Their function as potassium transporters was demonstrated by complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant. The two transporters are expressed most highly in the berry skin during the first phase of berry development (pre-veraison), with similar patterns in two grapevine varieties. The timing and location of expression of these transporters are consistent with an involvement in potassium accumulation in grape berries. © The Author [2006].

Although putative auxin-influx [6, 7] and -efflux [8-15] transporters have been identified by using molecular genetic approaches, a detailed functional understanding for many of these transporters remains undetermined. Here we present the functional characterization of the auxin-influx carrier AUX1. Upon expression of AUX1 in Xenopus oocytes, saturable, pH-dependent uptake of 3H-IAA was measured. Mutations in AUX1 that abrogate physiological responses to IAA in planta resulted in loss or reduction of 3H-IAA uptake in AUX1-expressing oocytes. AUX1-mediated uptake of 3H-IAA was reduced by the IAA analogs 2,4-D and 1-NOA, but not by other auxin analogs. The measured Km for AUX1-mediated uptake of 3H-IAA was at concentrations at which physiological responses are observed for exogenously added IAA and 2,4-D. This is the first report demonstrating detailed functional characteristics of a plant auxin-influx transporter. This biochemical characterization provides new insights and a novel tool for studying auxin entry into cells and its pivotal roles in plant growth and development. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To study the proteins in xylem sap, we characterized the identity and composition of the maize xylem sap proteome. The composition of the xylem sap proteome in maize revealed proteins related to different phases of xylem differentiation including cell wall metabolism, secondary cell wall synthesis, and programmed cell death. Many proteins were found to be present as multiple isoforms and some of these isoforms are glycosylated. Proteins involved in defense mechanisms were also present in xylem sap and the sap proteins were shown to have antifungal activity in bioassays. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Antifungal activity; Corn; Glycoprotein; Isoform; Maize; Plants; Proteome; Xylem sap","glycosylated protein; isoprotein; protein; vegetable protein; amino acid composition; antifungal activity; apoptosis; article; cell metabolism; cell wall; cell wall metabolism; cell wall synthesis; immunity; maize; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein content; proteomics; synthesis; tissue differentiation; xylem sap; Antifungal Agents; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Glycosylation; Histocytochemistry; Nanotechnology; Neurospora crassa; Peptide Mapping; Plant Components; Plant Extracts; Plant Proteins; Protein Isoforms; Proteome; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Trypsin; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"protein, 67254-75-5; Antifungal Agents; Plant Extracts; Plant Proteins; Protein Isoforms; Proteome; Trypsin, EC 3.4.21.4",,,,"Berger, D., Altmann, T., (2000) Genes Dev., 14, pp. 1119-1131; Biles, C.L., Abeles, F.B., (1991) Plant Physiol., 96, pp. 597-601; Else, M.A., Davies, W.J., Whitford, P.N., Hall, K.C., Jackson, M.B., (1994) J.

However, relatively little is known about the composition of CWPs in growing regions. We are using a proteomics approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of the identity of CWPs in the maize (Zea mays) primary root elongation zone. As the first step, we examined the effectiveness of a vacuum infiltration-centrifugation technique for extracting water-soluble and loosely ionically bound (fraction 1) CWPs from the root elongation zone. The purity of the CWP extract was evaluated by comparing with total soluble proteins extracted from homogenized tissue. Several lines of evidence indicated that the vacuum infiltration-centrifugation technique effectively enriched for CWPs. Protein identification revealed that 84% of the CWPs were different from the total soluble proteins. About 40% of the fraction 1 CWPs had traditional signal peptides and 33% were predicted to be nonclassical secretory proteins, whereas only 3% and 11%, respectively, of the total soluble proteins were in these categories. Many of the CWPs have previously been shown to be involved in cell wall metabolism and cell elongation. In addition, maize has type II cell walls, and several of the CWPs identified in this study have not been identified in previous cell wall proteomics studies that have focused only on type I walls. These proteins include endo-1,3;1,4-β-D-glucanase and α-L-arabinofuranosidase, which act on the major polysaccharides only or mainly present in type II cell walls. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Cells;

Warson Rd., St. Louis, MO 63132, United States","Root-knot plant-parasitic nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) account for much of the damage inflicted to plants by nematodes. The feeding sites of these nematodes consist of ""giant"" cells, which have characteristics of transfer cells found in other parts of plants. Increased transport activity across the plasma membrane is a hallmark of transfer cells, and giant cells provide nutrition for nematodes; therefore, we initiated a study to identify the transport processes that contribute to the development and function of nematode-induced feeding sites. The study was conducted over a 4-week period, during which time the large changes in the development of giant cells were documented. The Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip was used to identify the many transporter genes that were regulated by nematode infestation. Expression of 50 transporter genes from 18 different gene families was significantly changed upon nematode infestation. Sixteen transporter genes were studied in more detail using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to determine transcript abundance in nematode-induced galls that contain giant cells and uninfested regions of the root. Certain genes were expressed primarily in galls whereas others were expressed primarily in the uninfested regions of the root, and a third group was expressed evenly throughout the root. Multiple transport processes are regulated and these may play important roles in nematode feeding-site establishment and maintenance. © 2005 The American Phytopathological Society.","Membrane transport; Microarray","amino acid; carrier protein; active transport; animal; antibody specificity; Arabidopsis; article; cytology; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; nematode; parasitology; physiology; plant disease; plant root; Amino Acids; Animals; Arabidopsis; Biological Transport, Active; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Membrane Transport Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Organ Specificity; Plant Diseases; Plant Roots; Tylenchoidea; Arabidopsis; Meloidogyne; Nematoda",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; carrier protein, 80700-39-6; Amino Acids; Membrane Transport Proteins",,,,"Ane, J.-M., Kiss, G.B., Riely, B.K., Penmetsa, R.V., Oldroyd, G.E.D., Ayax, C., Levy, J., Cook, D.R., Medicago truncatula DMI1 required for bacterial and fungal symbioses in legumes (2004) Science, 303, pp. 1364-1367; Bassham, D.C., Raikhel, N.V., Unique features of the plant vacuolar sorting machinery (2000) Curr.

Moreover, the suitability of extraction techniques for use on plants grown under water-stress conditions has not been addressed. Xylem sap was extracted from both well-watered and water-stressed Zea mays plants using three different techniques. The main aim was to determine how the extraction method altered the correlations between sap constituents and stomatal conductance in order to determine which relationships change with extraction technique. A 'root pressure' technique was the simplest method of extracting large volumes of sap, but the low sap delivery rates altered the composition of sap. Two pressurization techniques that varied in the position from which sap was collected were tested. The pressurization techniques allowed for the control of delivery rates that influence sap constituent concentrations. The position from which xylem sap was collected on the plant was also found to be important. All three techniques produced consistent correlations between ABA and chloride delivery rates and changes in stomatal conductance, suggesting that each technique could be applied to identify certain putative xylem-borne signals. © The Author [2005].

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a role in root response to potassium deprivation. To determine the role of ROS in plant response to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency, studies were conducted using wild-type Arabidopsis and several root hair mutants. The expression of several nutrient-responsive genes was determined by Northern blot, and ROS were quantified and localized in roots. The monitored genes varied in intensity and timing of expression depending on which nutrient was deficient. In response to nutrient deprivation, ROS concentrations increased in specific regions of the Arabidopsis root. Changes in ROS localization in Arabidopsis and in a set of root hair mutants suggest that the root hair cells are important for response to nitrogen and potassium. In contrast, the response to phosphorus deprivation occurs in the cortex where an increase in ROS was measured. Based on these results, we put forward the hypothesis that root hair cells in Arabidopsis contain a sensing system for nitrogen and potassium deprivation. © 2005 JSPP.","Deprivation; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Roots; ROS; Starvation","hydrogen peroxide; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; reactive oxygen metabolite; Arabidopsis; article; gene; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; physiology; plant root; Arabidopsis; Gene Expression; Genes, Plant; Hydrogen Peroxide; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Roots; Potassium; Reactive Oxygen Species; Arabidopsis",,"hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; Hydrogen Peroxide, 7722-84-1; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Reactive Oxygen Species",,,,"Ahn, S.J., Shin, R., Schachtman, D.P., Expression of KT/KUP genes in Arabidopsis and the role of root hairs in K+ uptake (2004) Plant Physiol., 134, pp. 1135-1145; Apel, K., Hirt, H., Reactive oxygen species: Metabolism, oxidative stress and signal transduction (2004) Annu.

It is not known how plant root cells sense or signal the changes that occur after the onset of K+ deficiency. Changes in the kinetics of Rb+ uptake in Arabidopsis roots occur within 6 h after K+ deprivation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ethylene increased when the plants were deprived of K+. ROS accumulated in a discrete region of roots that has been shown to be active in K+ uptake and translocation. Suppression of an NADPH oxidase in Arabidopsis (rhd2), which is involved in ROS production, prevented the up-regulation of genes that are normally induced by K+ deficiency, but the induction of high-affinity K+ transport activity was unchanged. Application of H2O2 restored the expression of genes induced by K + deficiency in rhd2 and was also sufficient to induce high-affinity K+ transport activity in roots grown under K+-sufficient conditions. ROS production is an early root response to K+ deficiency that modulates gene expression and physiological changes in the kinetics of K+ uptake.",,"hydrogen peroxide; potassium; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; Arabidopsis; article; controlled study; gene control; gene expression; gene induction; nonhuman; nutritional deficiency; plant root; potassium transport; priority journal; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; Ethylenes; Gene Expression; Genes, Plant; Hydrogen Peroxide; Ion Transport; Plant Roots; Potassium; Reactive Oxygen Species; Rubidium; Arabidopsis",,"hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; potassium, 7440-09-7; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, 9032-22-8; ethylene, 74-85-1; Ethylenes; Hydrogen Peroxide, 7722-84-1; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Reactive Oxygen Species; Rubidium, 7440-17-7",,,,"Maser, P., Thomine, S., Schroeder, J.I., Ward, J.M., Hirschi, K., Sze, H., Talke, I.N., Sanders, D., (2001) Plant Physiol., 126, pp. 1646-1667; Kochian, L.V., Lucas, W.J., (1988) Advances in Botanical Research, 15, pp. 93-178. , Callow, J.

To ensure an adequate supply of K+, plants have multiple mechanisms for uptake and translocation. However, relatively little is known about the physiological role of proteins encoded by a family of 13 genes, named AtKT/KUP, that are involved in K+ transport and translocation. To begin to understand where and under what conditions these transporters function, we used reverse transcription-PCR to determine the spatial and temporal expression patterns of each AtKT/KUP gene across a range of organs and tested whether selected AtKT/KUP cDNAs function as K+ transporters in Escherichia coli. Many AtKT/KUPs were expressed in roots, leaves, siliques, and flowers of plants grown under K +-sufficient conditions (1.75 mM KCl) in hydroponic culture. AtHAK5 was the only gene in this family that was up-regulated upon K+ deprivation and rapidly down-regulated with resupply of K+. Ten AtKT/KUPs were expressed in root hairs, but only five were expressed in root tip cells. This suggests an important role for root hairs in K+ uptake. The growth and rubidium (Rb+) uptake of two root hair mutants, trh1-1 (tiny root hairs) and rhd6 (root hair defective), were studied to determine the contribution of root hairs to whole-plant K+ status. Whole-plant biomass decreased in the root hair mutants only when K+ concentrations were low; Rb+ (used as a tracer for K+) uptake rates were lower in the mutants at all Rb+ concentrations. Seven genes encoding AtKUP transporters were expressed in E. coli (AtKT3/KUP4, AtKT/KUP5, AtKT/KUP6, AtKT/KUP7, AtKT/KUP10, AtKT/KUP11, and AtHAK5), and their K+ transport function was demonstrated.",,"Escherichia coli; Genes; Growth kinetics; Proteins; Mutants; Translocations; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis protein; cation transport protein; messenger RNA; plant DNA; plant RNA; potassium; recombinant protein; rubidium; Arabidopsis; article; Escherichia coli; exon; gene; gene expression; genetic complementation; genetics; intron; ion transport; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; plant root; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA, Plant; Escherichia coli; Exons; Gene Expression; Genes, Plant; Genetic Complementation Test; Introns; Ion Transport; Plant Roots; Potassium; Recombinant Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Rubidium; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta; Escherichia coli; Eukaryota",,"potassium, 7440-09-7; rubidium, 7440-17-7; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA, Plant; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Recombinant Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Rubidium, 7440-17-7",,,,"Banuelos, M.A., Garciadeblas, B., Cubero, B., Rodriguez-Navarro, A., Inventory and functional characterization of the HAK potassium transporters of rice (2002) Plant Physiol, 130, pp. 784-795; Banuelos, M.A., Klein, R.D., Alexander-Bowman, S.J., Rodriguez-Navarro, A., A potassium transporter of the yeast Schwanniomyces occidentalis homologous to the Kup system of Escherichia coli has a high concentrative capacity (1995) EMBO J, 14, pp. 3021-3027; Bates, T.R., Lynch, J.P., Plant growth and phosphorus accumulation of wild type and two root hair mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) (2000) Am J Bot, 87, pp. 958-963; Buurman, E.T., Kim, K.T., Epstein, W., Genetic evidence for two sequentially occupied K+ binding sites in the Kdp transport ATPase (1995) J Biol Chem, 270, pp. 6678-6685; Deeken, R., Geiger, D., Fromm, J., Koroleva, O., Ache, P., Langenfeld-Heyser, R., Sauer, N., Hedrich, R., Loss of the AKT2/3 potassium channel affects sugar loading into the phloem of Arabidopsis (2002) Planta, 216, pp. 334-344; Elumalai, R.P., Nagpal, P., Reed, J.W., A mutation in the Arabidopsis KT2/KUP2 potassium transporter gene affects shoot cell expansion (2002) Plant Cell, 14, pp. 119-131; Epstein, E., Rains, D.W., Elzam, O.E., Resolution of dual mechanisms of potassium absorption by barley roots (1963) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 49, pp. 684-692; Epstein, W., Buurman, E., McLaggan, D., Naprstek, J., Multiple mechanisms, roles and controls of K+ transport in Escherichia coli (1993) Biochem Soc Trans, 21, pp. 1006-1010; Fernando, M., Kulpa, J., Siddiqi, M.Y., Adm, G., Potassium-dependent changes in the expression of membrane-associated proteins in barley roots: I.

Improved plant zinc efficiency will lead to increased yields when available zinc is limiting plant growth. The aim of our work was to test how the over-expression of zinc transporters in cereals affects plant growth, seed mineral content, and zinc transport rates. Known zinc transporters from Arabidopsis were over-expressed in Hordeum vulgare cv. Golden Promise by means of a ubiquitin promoter. Multiple transgenic lines were obtained, and the locus number and expression levels were verified. Transgenic lines were tested in long-term growth and short-term uptake experiments. Seeds from transgenic lines grown in soil had higher zinc and iron contents than controls. Short-term uptake rates were higher in the transgenic lines after zinc deprivation. Resupply of zinc after a period of deprivation resulted in the rapid decrease in zinc uptake even in transgenic lines in which a zinc transporter gene was constitutively expressed. Similar to processes in yeast and Arabidopsis, we hypothesize that this rapid decrease in zinc transport activity may be caused by the degradation of transporters in response to zinc-sufficient conditions. In the long-term growth experiments, there were no significant differences between transgenic and control lines in leaf zinc content or shoot biomass under zinc-sufficient or -deficient conditions. However, root-to-shoot ratios were higher in the transgenic plants grown under low-zinc conditions; this could impact zinc acquisition under field conditions. Increased seed zinc and iron content by over-expression of a zinc transporter provides a new strategy for increasing the micronutrient content of cereals.","Arabidopsis; barley; biofortification; over-expression; regulation; transporter; uptake; zinc","Transgenic lines; Zinc aquisition; Zinc transport activity; Biomass; Crops; Degradation; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Soils; Zinc; Molecular biology; Arabidopsis protein; cation transport protein; plant DNA; plant RNA; ZAT protein, Arabidopsis; zinc; article; barley; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Northern blotting; physiology; plant seed; Southern blotting; time; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis Proteins; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Southern; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA, Plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hordeum; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA, Plant; Seeds; Time Factors; Zinc; Biomass; Degradation; Farm Crops; Nutrition; Plants; Zinc; Arabidopsis; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Spermatophyta",,"zinc, 14378-32-6, 7440-66-6; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA, Plant; RNA, Plant; ZAT protein, Arabidopsis; Zinc, 7440-66-6",,,,"Aharon, R., Shahak, Y., Wininger, S., Bendov, R., Kapulnik, Y., Galili, G., Overexpression of a plasma membrane aquaporin in transgenic tobacco improves plant vigor under favorable growth conditions but not under drought or salt stress (2003) Plant Cell, 15, pp. 439-447; Assunção, A.G.L., Da Costa Martins, P., De Folter, S., Vooijs, R., Schat, H., Aarts, M.G.M., Elevated expression of metal transporter genes in three accessions of the metal hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens (2001) Plant Cell Environ., 24, pp. 217-226; Cakmak, I., Sari, N., Marschner, H., Ekiz, H., Kalayci, M., Yilmaz, A., Braun, H.J., Phytosiderophore release in bread and durum wheat genotypes differing in zinc efficiency (1996) Plant Soil, 180, pp. 183-189; Cakmak, I., Yilmaz, A., Kalayci, M., Ekiz, H., Torun, B., Erenoglu, B., Braun, H.J., Zinc deficiency as a critical problem in wheat production in Central Anatolia (1996) Plant Soil, 180, pp. 165-172; Christensen, A.H., Quail, P.H., Ubiquitin promoter-based vectors for high level expression of selectable and/or screenable marker genes in monocotyledonous plants (1996) Transgenic Res., 5, pp. 213-218; Connolly, E.L., Fett, J.P., Guerinot, M.L., Expression of the IRT1 metal transporter is controlled by metals at the levels of transcript and protein accumulation (2002) Plant Cell, 14, pp. 1347-1357; Curie, C., Alonso, J.M., Le Jean, M., Ecker, J.R., Briat, J.F., Involvement of NRAMP1 from Arabidopsis thaliana in iron transport (2000) Biochem.

Excess K levels in grape berries may have a negative impact on wine quality, mainly because it decreases free tartaric acid resulting in an increase in the pH of grape juice, must and wine. In Australia, high K status is common in most vineyards, which reflects the high K and high pH values of most Australian grape juice. This necessitates pH adjustment during the vinification process, and tartaric acid addition is a common practice in most Australian wineries. High K concentration may also lead to excessive loss of the additional tartaric acid by precipitation as potassium bitartrate and, as a consequence, pH adjustment becomes more difficult and expensive. Ensuring naturally low K levels in the berry will help reduce costs of input and waste management at the winery. Potential vineyard management options to manipulate berry K accumulation include selective use of rootstock/scion combination, canopy management and irrigation strategies. However, the impact of these practices on determining the optimum K concentration requires careful calibration of production parameters and the desirable grape juice and wine quality in relation to tissue K concentration. This paper reviews and discusses the possible functions of K in grape berries, translocation of K into the berry, and genetic and cultural factors that may affect the accumulation of K in the berry. This will help to identify the key research and management strategies needed for controlling K concentrations in grape berries.","Berry potassium; Grapevine; K+ transport; Potassium nutrition; Vitis vinifera L.; Wine quality","Vitis; Vitis sp.; Vitis vinifera",,,,,,"Ache, P., Becker, D., Deeken, R., Dreyer, I., Weber, H., Fromm, J., Hedrich, R., VFK1, a Vicia faba K+ channel involved in phloem unloading (2001) Plant Journal, 27, pp. 571-580; Archer, E., Strauss, H.C., Effect of shading on the performance of Vitis vinifera L. cv.

To understand zinc transport in cereals, we identified putative zinc transporters in gene databases. Three full-length cDNAs were identified and characterized from rice (Oryza sativa). Two of the cDNAs partially complemented a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant deficient in zinc uptake at low concentrations. The two transporters showed many similarities in function but differed in ionic selectivity and pH optimum of activity. Expression patterns also differed between the two genes. One gene was broadly expressed under all conditions, and the other gene was mainly induced by zinc deficiency to higher levels in roots than in leaves. Although the timing of expression differed between the two genes, localization of expression overlapped in roots. Comparisons of the protein sequences, ionic selectivity, and gene expression patterns of the two transporters suggest that they may play different roles in the physiology of the whole plant.",,"DNA; Genes;

We show that large amounts of Ca are accumulated as raphide crystals in the vacuoles of specialised cortical cells (idioblast cells) of the root apex. These crystal idioblast cells appeared to form a discontinuous cone of cells in the outer region of the root meristem. The raphide crystals within these cells were less apparent in older regions of the root, 10-12 mm basipetal to the root tip. We suggest that the raphide crystals could initially act as another Ca sink involved in the regulation of Ca levels in root apices. In older regions of the root these cells are spaced at intervals around the periphery of the cortex and the subsequent disappearance of the raphides may be indicative of remobilisation, perhaps in the zone of elongation where cell wall synthesis occurs and Ca demand is high. Calcium-accumulating cells were also observed in the older regions of the root, forming endodermal protrusions extending into the cortex. These cells may play a part in regulating Ca delivery to the xylem stream by sequestration of Ca from the radial flow of water at the endodermis. The observed distribution of Ca in root apices was different from the other major cations (e.g. K) and anions (e.g. Cl) because high concentrations were localised to specific cells. We interpret the results in the context of a model of the dynamics of grapevine root growth and cell differentiation, and the temporal balance of solute supply from the protophloem and the external medium.","Calcium crystals; Grapevine; Idioblast cells; Root meristem; SEM; Solute distribution","Calcium; Growth kinetics; Plants (botany); Synthesis (chemical); X ray analysis; Meristematic region; Cells; root; Vitis",,,,,,"Antcliff, A.J., Newman, H.P., Barrett, H.C., Variation in chloride accumulation in some American species of grapevine (1983) Vitis, 22, pp. 357-362; Arnott, H.J., (1962) The Seed, Germination and Seedling of Yucca, , University of California Publications in Botany; Arnott, H.J., Pautard, F.G., Calcification in plants (1970) Biological Calcification: Cellular and Molecular Aspects, pp. 375-446. , Ed.

In this study, we sought to determine whether rooted leaves could be used as a substitute for whole plants in ion accumulation studies. Grapevine leaves are particularly amenable for rooting since their petioles are of sufficient length for dipping in rooting hormone and for holding the leaf above the soil surface. To determine whether rooted leaves would be useful for salinity experiments, we investigated the ion uptake characteristics of rooted leaves derived from a backcross population that differed in Cl- accumulation. Long-term ion accumulation studies conducted over several weeks and short-term radioactive uptake studies conducted over several hours were performed. The data showed that the Cl- content of rooted grapevine leaves from different genotypes grown at 25 and 50 mM NaCl was similar to data reported by others. Short-term radioactive uptake assays did not always reveal differences in uptake between the genotypes. Therefore, we suggest that rooted leaves under certain conditions may provide a space-efficient method for generating sufficient amounts of plant material. This material could be used for studying whole plant, molecular and electrophysiological aspects of ion transport and for conducting experiments where root material from specific genotypes is required.","Chloride; Grapevine; Ion transport; Plant; Salinity; Sodium","biological uptake; ion; plant; Vitis",,,,,,"Abel, G.H., Inheritance of the capacity for chloride inclusion and chloride exclusion by soybeans (1969) Crop Sci., 9, pp. 697-698; Abel, G.H., Mackenzie, A.J., Salt tolerance of soybean varieties (Glycine max L.

The aim was to determine whether NaCl affects patterns of Cl- accumulation differentially in the roots of a Cl--excluding genotype and a non-excluding genotype. Two regions of fibrous roots were analysed: (1) a region 2-3 mm basipetal to the root tip; and (2) a region of the root 10-12 mm basipetal to the root tip where the outermost layer is the hypodermis. The ion contents of the hypodermis, cortex, endodermis and pericycle vacuoles were analysed. Data were also collected from the cytoplasm of the endodermal and pericycle cells. The analyses showed that the ion profiles of the hypodermis and the endodermis were significantly different from those of the cortex and pericycle. The hypodermis and endodermis had higher K+ and lower Na+ and Cl- than surrounding cells. Some changes due to salinity such as increased K+ concentrations in the hypodermis were also noted. Chloride concentrations did not differ between the genotypes in the hypodermis, across the cortex or in the endodermis, but were higher in the pericycle of the excluder in comparison with the non-excluding genotype. However, K+/Na+ ratios of the cortex and endodermis were higher in the excluder. The pericycle cells exhibited the greatest ability to sequester Na+ and Cl- in vacuoles. Overall the data show cell-type-specific ion accumulation patterns and small but significant differences were found between genotypes. The possibility that these accumulation patterns arise from differences in uptake properties of cell types and/or result from the spatial distribution of the cell types along the competing symplastic and apoplastic ion transport pathways across the root is discussed.","Chloride exclusion; Grapevine; Potassium; Root; Salinity; Sodium; X-ray microanalysis","biochemical composition; root system; salinization; Hypoderris; Vitis; Vitis sp.",,,,,,"Abel, G.H., Inheritance of the capacity for chloride inclusion and chloride exclusion by soybeans (1969) Crop Science, 9, pp. 697-698; Abel, G.H., Mackenzie, A.J., Salt tolerance of soybean varieties (Glycine max L.

This requires new genetic sources of salt tolerance, and more efficient techniques for identifying salt-tolerant germplasm, so that new genes for tolerance can be introduced into crop cultivars. Screening a large number of genotypes for salt tolerance is not easy. Salt tolerance is achieved through the control of salt movement into and through the plant, and salt-specific effects on growth are seen only after long periods of time. Early effects on growth and metabolism are likely due to osmotic effects of the salt, that is to the salt in the soil solution. To avoid the necessity of growing plants for long periods of time to measure biomass or yield, practical selection techniques can be based on physiological traits. We illustrate this with current work on durum wheat, on selection for the trait of sodium exclusion. We have explored a wide range of genetic diversity, identified a new source of sodium exclusion, confirmed that the trait has a high heritability, checked for possible penalties associated with the trait, and are currently developing molecular markers. This illustrates the potential for marker-assisted selection based on sound physiological principles in producing salt-tolerant crop cultivars.","Durum wheat; Molecular markers; Salinity; Sodium","physiology; salinization; sodium; tolerance; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",,,,,,"Almansouri, M., Kinet, J.-M., Lutts, S., Effect of salt and osmotic stresses on germination in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.)

Several different classes of K+ channels and carriers have been identified at the molecular level in plants. K+ transporters of the HKT1 superfamily have been cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum), Arabidopsis, and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The functional characteristics as well as the primary structure of these transporters are diverse with orthologues found in bacterial and fungal genomes. In this report, we provide a detailed characterization of the functional characteristics, as expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, of two cDNAs isolated from E. camaldulensis that encode proteins belonging to the HKT1 superfamily of K+/Na+ transporters. The transport of K+ in EcHKT-expressing oocytes is enhanced by Na+, but K+ was also transported in the absence of Na+. Na+ is transported in the absence of K+ as has been demonstrated for HKT1 and AtHKT1. Overall, the E. camaldulensis transporters show some similarities and differences in ionic selectivity to HKT1 and AtHKT1. One striking difference between HKT1 and EcHKT is the sensitivity to changes in the external osmolarity of the solution. Hypotonic solutions increased EcHKT induced currents in oocytes by 100% as compared with no increased current in HKT1 expressing or uninjected oocytes. These osmotically sensitive currents were not enhanced by voltage and may mediate water flux. The physiological function of these osmotically induced increases in currents may be related to the ecological niches that E. camaldulensis inhabits, which are periodically flooded. Therefore, the osmosensing function of EcHKT may provide this species with a competitive advantage in maintaining K+ homeostasis under certain conditions.",,"flooding; gene expression; gene function; genetic similarity; genetic structure; homeostasis; molecular analysis; oocyte; osmolarity; plant; potassium channel; potassium ion; Bacteria; DNA; Genes; Positive ions; Potassium; Tissue; Eucalyptus; Plants (botany); Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Anura; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biological Transport; Cation Transport Proteins; Cations, Divalent; Electrophysiology; Eucalyptus; Kinetics; Osmotic Pressure; Plant Proteins; Plants, Medicinal; Potassium; Sodium; Symporters; Arabidopsis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Embryophyta; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Eukaryota; Triticum aestivum; Xenopus laevis",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; Cations, Divalent; HKT1 protein, Arabidopsis; HKT1 protein, plant; Plant Proteins; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Sodium, 7440-23-5; Symporters",,,,"Amtmann, A., Sanders, D., Mechanisms of Na+ uptake by plant cells (1999) Adv Bot Res, 29, pp. 75-112; Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 796-815; Bihler, H., Gaber, R.F., Slayman, C.L., Bertl, A., The presumed potassium carrier Trk2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae determines an H+-dependent, K+-independent current (1999) FEBS Lett, 447, pp. 115-120; Blount, P., Moe, P.C., Bacterial mechanosensitive channels: Integrating physiology, structure and function (1999) Trends Microbiol, 7, pp. 420-424; Box, S., Schachtman, D.P., The effect of low concentrations of sodium on potassium uptake and growth of wheat (2000) Aust J Plant Physiol, 27, pp. 175-182; Clemens, S., Antosiewicz, D.M., Ward, J.M., Schachtman, D.P., Schroeder, J.I., The plant transporter LCT1 mediates the uptake of cadmium and calcium (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95, pp. 12043-12048; Czempinski, K., Zimmerman, S., Ehrhardt, T., Müller-Röber, B., New structure and function in plant K+ channels: KC01, an outward rectifier with a steep Ca2+ dependency (1997) EMBO J, 16, pp. 2565-2575; Eldridge, K., Davidson, J., Harwood, C., VanWyk, G., (1993) Eucalypt Domestication and Breeding, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Fairbairn, D.J., Liu, W.H., Schachtman, D.P., Gomez-Gallego, S., Day, S.R., Teasdale, R.D., Characterization of two distinct HKT1-like potassium transporters from Eucalyptus camaldulensis (2000) Plant Mol Biol, 43, pp. 515-525; Felix, G., Regenass, M., Boller, T., Sensing of osmotic pressure changes in tomato cells (2000) Plant Physiol, 124, pp. 1169-1179; Fu, H., Luan, S., AtKUPI: A dual affinity K+ transporter from Arabidopsis (1998) Plant Cell, 10, pp. 63-73; Gassmann, W., Rubio, F., Schroeder, J.I., Alkali cation selectivity of the wheat root high-affinity potassium transporter HKT1 (1996) Plant J, 10, pp. 869-882; Gassmann, W., Ward, J.M., Schroeder, J.I., Physiological roles of inward-rectifying K+ channels (1993) Plant Cell, 5, pp. 1491-1493; Gaymard, F., Pilot, F., Lacombe, B., Bouchez, D., Bruneau, D., Boucherez, J., Michaux-Ferriere, N., Sentenac, H., Identification and disruption of a plant shaker-like outward channel involved in K+ release into the xylem sap (1998) Cell, 94, pp. 647-655; Gibson, A., Bachelard, E.P., Hubrick, K.T., Growth strategies of Eucalyptus camaldulensis at three sites in northern Australia (1994) Aust J Plant Physiol, 21, pp. 653-662; Glass, A.D.M., The regulation of ion transport (1983) Annu Rev Plant Physiol, 34, pp. 311-326; Hirsch, R.E., Lewis, B.D., Spalding, E.P., Sussman, M.R., A role for the AKT1 potassium channel in plant nutrition (1998) Science, 280, pp. 918-921; Jeschke, W.D., Pate, J.S., Atkins, C.A., Partitioning of K+, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ through xylem and phloem to component organs of nodulated white lupin under mild salinity (1987) J Plant Physiol, 128, pp. 77-93; Kammerloher, W., Fischer, U., Piechottka, G.P., Schaffner, A.R., Water channels in the plant plasma membrane cloned by immunoselection from a mammalian expression system (1994) Plant J, 6, pp. 187-199; Kim, E.J., Kwak, J.M., Uozumi, N., Schroeder, J.I., AtKUP1: An Arabidopsis gene encoding high-affinity potassium transport activity (1998) Plant Cell, 10, pp. 51-62; Kochian, L.V., Lucas, W.J., Potassium transport in roots (1988) Advances in Botanical Research, pp. 93-178. , JA Callow, ed.

Box 373, York YO10 5YW, United Kingdom","Salinity affects large areas of agricultural land, and all major crop species are intolerant to high levels of sodium ions. The principal route for Na+ uptake into plant cells remains to be identified. Non-selective ion channels and high-affinity potassium transporters have emerged as potential pathways for Na+ entry. A third candidate for Na+ transport into plant cells is a low-affinity cation transporter represented by the wheat protein LCT1, which is known to be permeable for a wide range of cations when expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). To investigate the role of LCT1 in salt tolerance we have used the yeast strain G19, which is disrupted in the genes encoding Na+ export pumps and as a result displays salt sensitivity comparable with wheat. After transformation with LCT1, G19 cells became hypersensitive to NaCl. We show that LCT1 expression results in a strong decrease of intracellular K+/Na+ ratio in G19 cells due to the combined effect of enhanced Na+ accumulation and loss of intracellular K+. Na+ uptake through LCT1 was inhibited by K+ and Ca2+ at high concentrations and the addition of these ions rescued growth of LCT1-transformed G19 on saline medium. LCT1 was also shown to mediate the uptake of Li+ and Cs+. Expression of two mutant LCT1 cDNAs with N-terminal truncations resulted in decreased Ca2+ uptake and increased Na+ tolerance compared with expression of the full-length LCT1.

It plays an important physiological role in stoma movements, osmoregulation, enzyme activation and cell expansion. The demand for potassium can be substantial, especially when the plant concerned is a Eucalyptus tree in excess of 50 m tall. We have isolated two cDNAs, EcHKT1 and EcHKT2, from Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum) which are expressed in leaves, stems and roots. These encode potassium transporter polypeptides with homology to the wheat K+-Na+ symporter, HKT1. EcHKT1 and EcHKT2 both complemented the K+-limited growth of an Escherichia coli K+-uptake-deficient triple mutant. EcHKT1 and EcHKT2 also mediated Na+ and K+ uptake when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. A comparison of the EcHKT1 and EcHKT2 sequences and their transport properties indicated that these cDNAs represent two K+ transporters with distinct functional characteristics. The functional and structural conservation between these two E. camaldulensis genes and the wheat HKT1 suggests that they play an important, albeit elusive, physiological role.","Complementation; Electrophysiology; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Potassium transport; Salinity","bacterial mutant; cell membrane transport; complementary DNA; gene function; nucleotide sequence; oocyte; potassium; sequence homology; tissue specificity; Xenopus; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA, Complementary; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electrophysiology; Escherichia coli; Eucalyptus; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genetic Complementation Test; Membrane Potentials; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Oocytes; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Stems; Plants, Medicinal; Potassium; Protein Isoforms; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Plant; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sodium; Symporters; Tissue Distribution; Xenopus","GENBANK: AF176035, AF176036","Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA, Complementary; HKT1 protein, plant; Membrane Proteins; Plant Proteins; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Protein Isoforms; RNA, Plant; Sodium, 7440-23-5; Symporters",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

These transporters are primarily involved in K+ uptake and are energized by Na+ or H+. HKT1 is energized by Na+ but also mediates low affinity Na+ uptake and may therefore be a pathway for Na+ uptake, which is toxic to plants. The aim of this study was to identify regions of HKT1 that are involved in K+/Na+ selectivity and alter the amino acid composition in those regions to increase the ionic selectivity of the transporter. A highly charged loop was identified, and two deletions were created that resulted in the removal of charged and uncharged amino acids. The functional changes caused by the deletions were studied in yeast and Xenopus oocytes. The deletions improved the K+/Na+ selectivity of the transporter and increased the salt tolerance of the yeast cells in which they were expressed. In light of recent structural models of members of this symporter superfamily, it was necessary to determine the orientation of this highly charged loop. Introduction of an epitope tag allowed us to demonstrate thai this loop faces the outside of the membrane where it is likely to facilitate the interaction with cations such as K+ and Na+. This study has identified an important structural feature in HKT1 that in part determines its K+/Na+ selectivity. Understanding the structural basis of the functional characteristics in transporters such as HKT1 may have important implications for increasing the salt tolerance of higher plants.",,"epitope; potassium ion; proton; sodium ion; amino acid composition; article; ion permeability; nonhuman; potassium transport; priority journal; protein structure; site directed mutagenesis; sodium transport; structure activity relation; Xenopus laevis; yeast; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; Cell Membrane; Cell Membrane Permeability; Cloning, Molecular; Escherichia coli; Female; Kinetics; Membrane Proteins; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oocytes; Plant Proteins; Potassium; Protein Structure, Secondary; Recombinant Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sequence Deletion; Sodium; Symporters; Xenopus laevis; Embryophyta; Fungi; Xenopus laevis",,"Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; HKT1 protein, plant; Membrane Proteins; Plant Proteins; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Recombinant Proteins; Sodium, 7440-23-5; Symporters",,,,"Schachtman, D.P., Schroeder, J.I., (1994) Nature, 370, pp. 655-658; Schachtman, D.P., Liu, W., (1999) Trends Plant Sci, 4, pp. 281-286; Schlosser, A., Meldorf, M., Stumpe, S., Bakker, E.P., Epstein, W., (1995) J.

PCR amplification with the primers ITS1 and ITS4 was performed and products were cloned and sequenced. The sequences from single spores of G. mosseae and Gi. margarita confirmed that there is variation in the ITS region in a single spore. Phenetic analysis of sequences from both species supported the morphological identification which placed the species into two separate groups. Through the analysis of these sequences an estimate of genetic diversity was derived which clearly showed that the three field spores of G. mosseae were at least 2-5 times more genetically diverse than one single spore (field) and a pool of spores (pot culture) of Gigaspora margarita. This demonstrates that a high degree of variation exists in this natural population of G. mosseae.",,"fungal spore; genetic diversity; genetic variance; internal transcribed spacer; morphology; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; primer DNA; ribosomal DNA; fungus; genetic variation; polymerase chain reaction; Gigaspora margarita; Glomus mosseae",,,,,,"Altschul, P., Stephen, F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) Journal of Molecular Biology, 215, pp. 403-410; Bago, B., Bentivenga, S., Brenac, V., Dodd, J., Piche, Y., Simon, L., Molecular analysis of Gigaspora (Glomaks, Gigasporaceae) (1998) New Phytologist, 139, pp. 581-588; Bentivenga, S.P., Morton, J.B., Stability and heritability of fatty acid methyl ester profiles of glomalean endomycorrhizal fungi (1994) Mycological Research, 98, pp. 1419-1426; Blaszkowski, J., First record and notes on Glomus coronatum in Poland and Germany (1994) Mycologia, 86, pp. 630-634; Chen, W., Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in enzymatically amplified ribosomal DNAs of three heterothallic Pythium species (1992) Phytopathology, 82, pp. 1467-1472; Clapp, J.P., Young, J.P.W., Merryweather, J., Fitter, A.H., Diversity of fungal symbionts in arbuscular mycorrhizas from a natural community (1995) New Phytologist, 130, pp. 259-265; Dodd, J., Rosendahl, S., Giovannetti, M., Broome, A., Lanfranco, L., Walker, C., Inter- and intraspecific variation within the morphologically -similar arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mossene and Glomus coronatum (1996) New Phytologist, 133, pp. 113-122; Erland, S., Henrion, B., Martin, F., Glover, L.A., Alexander, I.J., Identification of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Tylospora fibrillosa donk by RFLP analysis of the PCR-amplified ITS and IGS regions of ribosomal DNA (1994) New Phytologist, 126, pp. 525-532; Franken, P., Gianinazzi-Pearson, V., Construction of genomic phage libraries of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae and Scutellspora castanea and isolation of ribosomal RNA genes (1996) Mycorrhiza, 6, pp. 167-173; Gadkar, V., Adholeya, A., Satyanarayana, T., Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA using the M13 core sequence of the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Gigaspora margarita and Gigaspora gigantea (1997) Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 43, pp. 795-798; Giovannetti, M., Gianinazzi-Pearson, V., Biodiversity in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (1994) Mycological Research, 98, pp. 705-715; Grace, P.R., Oades, J.M., Keith, H., Hancock, T.W., Trends in wheat yields and soil organic carbon in the permanent rotation trial at the waite agricultural research institute, South Australia (1995) Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture, 35, pp. 857-864; Helgason, T., Daniel, T., Husband, R., Fitter, A., Young, J., Ploughing up the wood-wide web?

In this review, recent work on inward and outward rectifying K+ channels as well as high affinity K+ transporters is described. Through the work on inward rectifying K+ channels, we now have precise details on how the structure of these proteins determines functional characteristics such as ion conduction, pH sensitivity, selectivity and voltage sensing. The physiological function of inward rectifying K+ channels in plants has been clarified through the analysis of expression patterns and mutational analysis. Two classes of outward rectifying K+ channels have now been cloned from plants and their initial characterisation is reviewed. The physiological role of one class of outward rectifying K+ channel has been demonstrated to be involved in long distance transport of K+ from roots to shoots. The molecular structure and function of two classes of energised K+ transporters are also reviewed. The first class is energised by Na+ and shares structural similarities with K+ transport mechanisms in bacteria and fungi. Structure-function studies suggest that it should be possible to increase the K+ and Na+ selectivity of these transporters, which will enhance the salt tolerance of higher plants. The second class of K+ transporter is comprised of a large gene family and appears to have a dual affinity for K+. A suite of molecular techniques, including gene cloning, oocyte expression, RNA localisation and gene inactivation, is now being used to fully characterise the biophysical and physiological function of plants K+ transport mechanisms.

The role of Na+ in energising K+ acquisition in terrestrial plants has recently been suggested because of evidence demonstrating that wheat root cells express a high-affinity Na+-energised K+ symporter. To determine whether low concentrations of Na+ improve the K+ nutrition and growth of wheat, long-term growth and short-term tracer flux experiments were conducted. Long-term growth experiments were conducted over a range of K+ concentrations, at acidic and alkaline pH, with and without 500 μM NaCl. Plant biomass and tissue Na+ and K+ content was measured. Short-term experiments were conducted using tracers to determine whether low concentrations of Na+ or K+ stimulate Rb+ or Na+ uptake, respectively. Sodium stimulated the growth of wheat only at low (20 μm) external K+ in one of the long-term experiments, but not in two other experiments. Na+ did not stimulate Rb+ uptake, but K+ stimulated Na+ uptake in short-term tracer flux experiments. The results suggest that low concentrations of Na+ do not increase K+ uptake to a large extent, and only when light levels are low does Na+ have a beneficial effect on the growth of wheat.","High-affinity; Potassium; Sodium; Uptake; Wheat","concentration; growth; nutrient uptake; potassium; sodium; wheat",,,,,,"Asher, C.J., Ozanne, P.G., Growth and potassium content of plants in solution cultures maintained at constant potassium concentrations (1967) Soil Science, 103, pp. 155-161; Brownell, P.F., Sodium as an essential micronutrient element for plants and its possible role in metabolism (1979) Advances in Botanical Research, 7, pp. 117-224; Brownell, P.F., Crossland, C.J., The requirement for sodium as a micronutrient by species having the C4 dicarboxylic photosynthetic pathway (1972) Plant Physiology, 49, pp. 794-797; Diatloff, E., Kumar, R., Schachtman, D.P., Site directed mutagenesis reduces the Na+ affinity of HKT1, a Na+ energised high-affinity K+ transporter (1998) FEBS Letters, 432, pp. 31-36; Epstein, E., Rains, D.W., Elzam, O.E., Resolution of dual mechanisms of potassium absorption by barley roots (1963) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 49, pp. 684-692; Eshel, A., Waisel, R., Variations in uptake of sodium and rubidium along barley roots (1973) Plant Physiology, 28, pp. 557-560; Fernando, M., Kulpa, J., Siddiqi, M.Y., Glass, A.D.M., Potassium-dependent changes in the expression of membrane-associated proteins in barley roots.

It is assumed that these arbuscules are the major sites of solute transfer between the plant and fungus, but there have been no studies that definitively show the extent or types of transfer processes that occur in this structure. Phosphate is one of the major nutrients that is acquired by mycorrhizal fungi and transferred to plants. In this study a single Lycopersicon esculentum cDNA was cloned and shown to be identical to LePT1, a previously cloned inorganic-phosphate transporter. Expression studies revealed that LePT1 transcript levels remained constant in mycorrhizal plants, but increased in phosphate-starved, non-mycorrhizal plants. Localization of the LePT1 transcript by in situ hybridization showed that this gene is highly expressed in arbuscule-containing cortical cells in mycorrhizal plants. In non-mycorrhizal plants LePT1 expression was localized to the stele and cortex. The expression studies suggest that this transporter is involved in phosphate nutrition of L. esculentum and its localization in cells that contain arbuscules indicate that it may be the mechanism used by the plant to take up phosphate that is effluxed across the fungal plasma membrane of the arbuscule. Based on our findings and those of others, an integrated model of inorganic phosphate uptake and transfer in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants is presented.","Arbuscule; In situ RNA localization; Mycorrhiza; Phosphate; Tomato; Transport","arbuscule; complementary DNA; genetic transcription; in situ hybridization; phosphate transport; phosphate transporter; protein expression; protein localization; vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza; Lycopersicon esculentum",,,,,,"Borst-Pauwels, G.W.F.H., Ion transport in yeast (1981) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 650, pp. 88-127; Bun-Ya, M., Nishimura, M., Harashima, S., Oshima, Y., The PHO84 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an inorganic phosphate transporter (1991) Molecular and Cellular Biology, 11, pp. 3229-3238; Bun-Ya, M., Shikata, K., Nakade, S., Yompakdee, C., Harashima, S., Oshima, Y., Two new genes, PHO86 and PHO87, involved in inorganic phosphate uptake in Saccaromyces cerevisiae (1996) Current Genetics, 29, pp. 344-351; Burns, D.J.W., Beever, R.E., Kinetic characterisation of two phosphate uptake systems in the fungus Neurospora crassa (1977) Journal of Bacteriology, 132, pp. 511-519; Clarkson, D.T., Ionic relations (1984) Advanced Plant Physiology, pp. 319-353. , Wilkins MB, ed.

This can result in high Na+:K+ ratios that reduce plant growth and eventually become toxic. Our understanding of the molecular basis underlying the interaction between essential potassium and toxic sodium was limited until the recent cloning and electrophysiological characterization of several genes encoding different types of molecules that are involved in K+ and Na+ transport. These molecules, and their regulation, are important in determining the K+:Na+ homeostasis of plants in saline soils, although it is not yet known which is most critical in determining the K+:Na+ ratios in whole plants.",,"cell membrane; growth regulation; molecular genetics; nutrient; plant genetics; potassium; sodium",,,,,,"Brownell, P.F., Sodium as an essential micronutrient element for plants and its possible role in metabolism (1979) Adv.

The boom in the field of molecular plant physiology led to the identification and characterization of membrane transporters with transport activities for potassium, calcium, sugars, nitrate, ammonium, sulphate, phosphate, amino acids, peptides, and metal ions. Such progress was hardly feasible without heterologous expression of the isolated transport proteins. This review summarizes the different approaches in characterizing plant membrane transporters using heterologous expression systems. By presenting concrete examples, it outlines different cloning strategies, displays the methods used for (i) expression of transport proteins and detection of their function, (ii) biochemical analyses, (iii) explorations of the structure-function relationship through mutational analysis, and concludes with a discussion about the physiological relevance of the analyses in heterologous expression systems.","Cloning strategies;

Two distinct applications of molecular biological techniques are described that could be used to manipulate the micronutrient density in edible portions of food crops. One is the use of DNA markers as genetic tags for the introgression of desired traits and the second is the introduction of defined genetic material, which is the process of genetic engineering. This chapter covers concepts important in the use of molecular markers and concentrates on molecular details of micronutrient uptake by model plant and microbial species because of the recent advances in this area of research. Although micronutrient uptake processes do not all directly relate to major human nutritional deficiencies, the review of this area of research provides a conceptual framework for consideration of aspects important when developing crops for improved human health.","Copper; Genetic engineering; Iron; Manganese; Molecular markers; Transport; Uptake; Yeast; Zinc","agronomy; determination of content; genetic engineering; genetic marker; nutrient; plant genetics; plant nutrition",,,,,,"Agrios, G.N., (1988) Plant Pathology, , Academic Press, San Diego; Askwith, C.C., De Silva, D., Kaplan, J., Molecular biology of iron acquisition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1996) Mol.

To identify possible pathways for Cd2+ transport we tested putative plant cation transporters for Cd2+ uptake activity by expressing cDNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that expression of one clone, LCT1, renders the growth of yeast more sensitive to cadmium. Ion flux assays showed that Cd2+ sensitivity is correlated with an increase in Cd2+ uptake. LCT1-dependent Cd2+ uptake is saturable, lies in the high-affinity range (apparent K(M) for Cd2+ = 33μM) and is sensitive to block by La2+ and Ca2+. Growth assays demonstrated a sensitivity of LCT1-expressing yeast cells to extracellular millimolar Ca2+ concentrations. LCT1-dependent increase in Ca2+ uptake correlated with the observed phenotype. Furthermore, LCT1 complements a yeast disruption mutant in the MIDI gene, a non-LCTl-homologous yeast gene encoding a membrane Ca2+ influx system required for recovery from the mating response. We conclude that LCT1 mediates the uptake of Ca2+ and Cd2+ in yeast and may therefore represent a first plant cDNA encoding a plant Ca2+ uptake or an organellar Ca2+ transport pathway in plants and may contribute to transport of the toxic metal Cd2+ across plant membranes.",,"cadmium; calcium; complementary dna; plant dna; article; cation transport; controlled study; gene expression; genetic complementation; membrane transport; nonhuman; phenotype; plant growth; priority journal; saccharomyces cerevisiae; wheat; Base Sequence; Cadmium; Calcium; Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Fungal Proteins; Gene Deletion; Genes, Fungal; Genes, Plant; Genetic Complementation Test; Ion Transport; Kinetics; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mutation; Phenotype; Plant Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Triticum",,"Cadmium, 7440-43-9; Calcium, 7440-70-2; Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Fungal Proteins; LCT1 protein, Triticum aestivum; Membrane Glycoproteins; MID1 protein, S cerevisiae; Plant Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,,,"Bush, D.S., (1995) Annu.

To identify regions of the protein involved in the binding and transport of Na+ and K+, mutations were introduced into a domain of KHT1 containing 16 amino acids that are highly conserved across a range of putative K+ transport proteins from different phyla. Two mutations had a significant effect on the functional characteristics of the transporter. A yeast growth assay showed that concentrations of NaCl between 2.5 to 50 mM stimulated the growth of yeast expressing HKT1 containing the E464Q substitution, but not the growth of yeast expressing HKT1. Kinetic analysis confirmed that the E464Q mutation lowered the affinity of HKT1 for Na+ but did not affect its affinity for K+. A second mutation in the same region F463L was created that also lowered the affinity of the transporter for Na+. The importance of these highly conserved amino acid residues is highlighted by the fact that they have remained conserved through evolution. The results of this mutational analysis suggest that this domain in HKT1 plays a role in the binding and transport of Na+.","High affinity; Plant; Potassium; Site-directed mutagenesis; Sodium; Transporter","carrier protein; amino acid sequence; article; binding site; kinetics; phytochemistry; potassium transport; priority journal; protein binding; site directed mutagenesis; sodium transport; wheat; Amino Acid Sequence; Biological Transport; Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; Cations, Monovalent; Conserved Sequence; DNA Mutational Analysis; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Plant Proteins; Potassium; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sodium; Symporters; Triticum aestivum",,"Carrier Proteins; Cation Transport Proteins; Cations, Monovalent; HKT1 protein, plant; Membrane Proteins; Plant Proteins; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Sodium, 7440-23-5; Symporters",,,,"Schachtman, D.P., Schroeder, J.I., (1994) Nature, 370, pp. 655-658; Rubio, F., Gassmann, W., Schroeder, J.I., (1995) Science, 270, pp. 1660-1663; Gassmann, W., Rubio, F., Schroeder, J.I., (1996) Plant J., 10, pp. 869-882; Smith, F.A., Walker, N.A., (1989) J.

In this study, several techniques were used to determine the seasonal water use characteristics of the perennial grass Agropyron elongatum (tall wheatgrass) growing in a moderately saline, dryland environment with a fluctuating shallow groundwater table varying in electrical conductivity between 0 and 10 dS m-1. Soil conditions were examined in terms of water potential measurements, plant water sources were identified using a stable isotope of water (deuterium, 2H) and evapotranspiration was estimated using hydrological and ventilated chamber methods. Seasonal changes in soil water potential were caused by salt accumulation and soil moisture leading to changes in plant water availability, particularly in the surface soil region over summer and autumn. Evapotranspiration in A. elongatum was high over summer during the peak period of growth (4 mm d-1), with evidence of water use from groundwater and from specific regions of the soil profile. Evapotranspiration was low during the period that A. elongatum was partially senescent in autumn (&lt; 0.5 mm d-1) and the lowest leaf water potential of-3 MPa that was measured occurred during this period of moderate water stress. Intermediate levels of water use (1·5 mm d-1) were measured during winter when the entire soil profile was available for water uptake. Based on physiological characteristics, including aspects of summer water use, root morphology and salt tolerance in A. elongatum, we conclude that this species is suitable for stabilizing the level of moderately saline groundwater in parts of southern Australia, which could reduce the potential for soil salinization.","Agropyron elongatum; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Salinity; Stable isotopes; Tall wheatgrass; Water potential; Water sources; Water use","Agropyron; Thinopyrum elongatum",,,,,,"Allison, G.B., Barnes, C.J., Hughes, M.W., The distribution of deuterium and18O in dry soils, 2.

In higher plants the coordinated expression of transport mechanisms is essential for specialized cellular processes and for adaptation to variable environmental conditions. To understand the molecular basis of cation transport in plant roots, a Triticum aestivum cDNA library was used to complement a yeast mutant deficient in potassium (K 2) uptake. Two genes were cloned that complemented the mutant: HKT1 and a novel cDNA described in this report encoding a cation transporter, LCT1 (low-affinity cation transporter). Analysis of the secondary structure of LCT1 suggests that the protein contains 8-10 transmembrane helices and a hydrophilic amino terminus containing sequences enriched in Pro, Ser, Thr, and Glu (PEST). The transporter activity was assayed using radioactive isotopes in yeast cells expressing the cDNA. LCT1 mediated low-affinity uptake of the cations Rb + and Na +, and possibly allowed Ca 2+ but not Zn 2+ uptake. LCT1 is expressed in low abundance in wheat roots and leaves. The precise functional role of this cation transporter is not known, although the competitive inhibition of cation uptake by Ca 2+ has parallels to whole plant and molecular studies that have shown the important role of Ca 2+ in reducing Na + uptake and ameliorating Na + toxicity.

Over a 6- yr period, two cyclic drainage-water reuse practices were tested in a 3-yr rotation of processing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). In both practices, drainage water (EC1 = 7.4 dS m- 1 and 0.74 mmol L-1 B) was applied to processing tomato after first bloom to take advantage of salt-induced enhancement of fruit quality and increased crop salt tolerance at later developmental stages. In one practice, drainage water was also applied to the following cotton crop after thinning. Nonsaline water was used for irrigation at all other times and throughout for the control. When saline water was applied once every 3 yr, yields of both crops were unaffected. Tomato yields were generally lowest when saline water was applied 2 out of 3 yr, but saline water improved tomato fruit quality by increasing °Brix in most years. Changes in soil chemical and physical quality may limit long-term reuse. Both B and salts accumulated in the soil over time, particularly at depth (60-140 cm), whereas Se was more readily leached and showed greater fluctuations in the rootzone with irrigation treatment. Calculations using reclamation formulae estimated that for low B drainage water, the amount of drainage wager used exceeded that of nonsaline water needed to return soil EC(e) to control levels, resulting in significant water savings. For high B drainage water, more than twice the amount of nonsaline water was needed to fully reclaim the profile than was saved by reuse. However, moderately B-tolerant crops could he successfully grown during the reclamation period, making cyclic reuse for at least 6 yr an attractive option for growers facing limited supplies of nonsaline water supplies, or as a means to reduce effluent volumes.",,"Crops; Drainage; Saline water; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water quality; Water recycling; Cyclic saline water reuse; Tomato cotton rotation; Irrigation; boron; selenium; article; crop; effluent; land use; water quality; water supply; Gossypium hirsutum; Gossypium hirsutum; Hirsutum; Lycopersicon esculentum; Lycopersicon esculentum",,"boron, 7440-42-8; selenium, 7782-49-2",,,,,"Shennan, C.; Dep. of Vegetable Crops, Univ. of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States",,,"American Soc of Agronomy Inc, Madison",,,,,00472425,,JEVQA,,"English","J.

K+ accumulation can be rate-limiting for agricultural production. K+ uptake from soils into roots is largely mediated by high-affinity K+ uptake (K(m) ≃ 10-40 μM) (refs 1, 2, 5-7). But although K+ channels allow low-affinity K+ uptake, both the transport mechanisms and structure of the high-affinity K+ nutrition pathway remain unknown. Here we use expression cloning to isolate a complementary DNA encoding a membrane protein (HKT1) from wheat roots which confers the ability to take up K+. The substrate affinity, saturation and cation selectivity of HKT1 correspond to hallmark properties of classical high-affinity K+ uptake plants. The transport mechanism of HKT1 uses K+-H+ co-uptake. Expression of HKT1 is localized to specific root and leaf regions which represent primary sites for K+ uptake in plants.

Schmal. (D genome donor to hexaploid wheat) vary in salt tolerance and in the rate that Na+ accumulates in leaves. The aim of this study was to determine whether these differences in salt tolerance and leaf Na+ concentration would be expressed in hexaploid wheat. Synthetic hexaploids were produced from five T. tauschii accessions varying in salt tolerance and two salt-sensitive T. turgidum cultivars. The degree of salt tolerance of the hexaploids was evaluated as the grain yield per plant in 150 mol m-3 NaCl relative to grain yield in 1 mol m-3 NaCl (control). Sodium concentration in leaf 5 was measured after the leaf was fully expanded. The salt tolerance of the genotypes correlated negatively with the concentration of Na+ in leaf 5. The salt tolerance of the synthetic hexaploids was greater than the tetraploid parents primarily due to the maintenance of kernel weight under saline conditions. Synthetic hexaploids varied in salt tolerance with the source of their D genome which demonstrates that genes for salt tolerance from the diploid are expressed at the hexaploid level. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Genetics; Salinity; Wheat",,,,,,,"Appels, R., Lagudah, E.S., Manipulation of chromosomal segments from wild wheat for the improvement of bread wheat (1990) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 17, pp. 253-266; Dvorak, J., Ross, K., Expression of tolerance of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, an SO<inf>4</inf>2− ions and sea water in the amphiploid of Triticum aestivum x Elytrigia elongata (1986) Crop Science, 26, pp. 658-660; Eastwood, R.F., Lagudah, E.S., Appels, R., Hannah, M., Kollmorgen, J.F., Triticum tauschii: a novel source of resistance to cereal cyst nematode (Heterodera avenae) (1991) Aust J Agric Res, 42, pp. 69-77; Evans, L.T., Dunstone, R.L., Some physiological aspects of evolution in wheat (1970) Aust J Biol Sci, 23, pp. 725-741; Evans, L.T., Wardlaw, I.F., Fischer, R.A., Wheat (1975) Crop physiology some case histories, pp. 101-150. , L.T., Evans, Cambride University Press, London; Forster, B.P., Gorham, J., Miller, T.E., Salt tolerance of an amphiploid between Triticum aestivum and Agropyron junceum (1987) Plant Breeding, 98, pp. 1-8; Francois, L.E., Maas, E.V., Donovan, T.J., Youngs, V.L., Effect of salinity on grain yield and quality, vegetative growth, and germination of semi-dwarf and durum wheat (1986) Agronomy Journal, 78, pp. 1053-1058; Gorham, J., Hardy, C., Wyn Jones, R.G., Joppa, L.R., Law, C.N., Chromosomal location of a K/Na discrimination character in the D genome of wheat (1987) Theor Appl Genet, 74, pp. 584-588; Gorham, J., Wyn Jones, R.G., Bristol, A., Partial characterization of the trait for enhanced K+-Na+ discrimination in the D genome of wheat (1990) Planta, 180, pp. 590-597; Hunt, J., Dilute hydrochloric acid-extraction of plant material for routine cation analysis (1982) Comm Soil Sci Plant Anal, 13, pp. 49-55; Lagudah, E.S., Macritchie, F., Halloran, G.M., The influence of high molecular-weight subunits of glutenin from Triticum tauschii on flour quality of synthetic hexaploid wheat (1987) Journal of Cereal Science, 5, pp. 129-138; Maas, E.V., Grieve, C.M., Spike and leaf development in salt-stressed wheat (1990) Crop Science, 30, pp. 1309-1313; Orth, R.A., Bushuk, W., Studies of glutenin.

The cation outward rectifier channels were voltage-dependent with a single channel conductance of 32 ± 1 picosiemens in 100 millimolar KCl. Whole-cell currents were dominated by the activity of the cation outward rectifiers. The time- and voltage-dependence of these currents was accounted for by the summed behavior of individual channels recorded from outside-out detached patches. The K+/Na+ permeability ratio of these channels was measured in a salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant genotype of wheat that differ in rates of Na+ accumulation, using a voltage ramp protocol on protoplasts in the whole-cell configuration. Permeability ratios were calculated from shifts in reversal potentials following ion substitutions. There were no significant differences in the K+/Na+ permeability ratios of these channels in root cells from either of the two genotypes tested. The permeability ratio for K+/Cl- was greater than 50:1. The K+/Na+ permeability ratio averaged 30:1, which is two to four times more selective than the same type of channel in guard cells and suspension culture cells. Lowering the Ca2+ concentration in the bath solution to 0.1 millimolar in the presence of 100 millimolar Na+ had no significant effect on the K+/Na+ permeability ratios of the channel. It seems unlikely that the mechanism of salt tolerance in wheat is based on differences in the K+/Na+ selectivity of these channels.",,,,,,,,,"Schachtman, D.P.; UCSD Biology Department, San Diego, CA 92093-0116, United States",,,,,,,,00320889,,PLPHA,,"English","Plant Physiol.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-12044255103
