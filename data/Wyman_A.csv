Acidification, N-bromosuccinimide modification of Trp, reduction or elimination of a disulfide bond, or deletion of C-terminal amino acids abolishes these signals. Site-directed mutations that substitute Phe for Trp241 and Tyr242, near the C-terminus of PsbO, were used to examine the contribution of these residues to the activity and spectral properties of the protein. Although this substitution is, in theory, conservative, neither mutant binds efficiently to PSII, even though these proteins appear to retain wild-type solution structures. Removal of six residues from the N-terminus of the W241F mutant restores activity to near-wild-type levels. The near-UV CD spectra of the mutants are modified; well-defined Tyr and Trp peaks are lost. Characterizations of the fluorescence spectra of the full-length WF and YF mutants indicate that Y242 contributes significantly to PsbO's Tyr fluorescence emission and that an excited-state tyrosinate could be present in PsbO. Deletion of W241 shows that this residue is a major contributor to PsbO's fluorescence emission. Loss of function is consistent with the proposal that a native C-terminal domain is required for PsbO binding and activity, and restoration of activity by deletion of N-terminal amino acids may provide some insights into the evolution of this important photosynthetic protein. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Acids; Amination; Amines; Aromatic compounds; Cadmium; Cadmium compounds; Chemical reactions; Crack detection; Emission spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Health; Light emission; Luminescence; Manganese; Organic acids; Plants (botany); Port terminals; (e ,2e) theory; American Chemical Society (ACS); Aromatic amino acids; C terminus; C-terminal domain (CTD); CD signals; CD spectra; disulfide bonds; Evolution (CO); Excited states; fluorescence emissions; fluorescence properties; fluorescence spectrum; N terminals; N-bromosuccinimide (NBS); Photosystem II (PS II); Site directed mutagenesis; Site-directed mutations; Solution structures; Spectral properties; Tryptophan residues; Tyrosine (Tyr); Wild-type (WT); Wild-type levels; Amino acids; mutant protein; tryptophan; acidification; article; circular dichroism; fluorescence; gel permeation chromatography; mutagenesis; nonhuman; photosynthesis; photosystem II; priority journal; protein binding; protein modification; purification; spectrofluorometry; substitution reaction; ultraviolet spectroscopy; Circular Dichroism; Conserved Sequence; Manganese; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Peptide Fragments; Phenylalanine; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plant Proteins; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Spinacia oleracea; Tryptophan; Tyrosine",,"tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; Manganese, 7439-96-5; oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1, plant; Peptide Fragments; Phenylalanine, 63-91-2; photosystem II manganese-stabilizing protein; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plant Proteins; Tryptophan, 73-22-3; Tyrosine, 55520-40-6",,,,"Nelson, N., Yocum, C.F., Structure and function of photosystems I and II (2006) Annu.

This protein has been shown to possess characteristics similar to those of the intrinsically disordered, or natively unfolded proteins [Lydakis-Simantiris et al. (1999b) Biochemistry 38: 404-414]. Alternately it was proposed that MSP should be classified as a molten globule, based in part on the hypothesis that its lone disulfide bridge is necessary for structural stability and function in solution [Shutova et al. (2000) FEBS Lett. 467: 137-140]. A site-directed mutant MSP (C28A,C51A) that eliminates the disulfide bond reconstitutes O2 evolution activity and binds to MSP-free PS II preparations at wild-type levels [Betts et al. (1996) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1274: 135-142]. This mutant was further characterized by incubation at 90°C to determine the effect of loss of the disulfide bridge on MSP thermostability and solution structure. After heating at 90°C for 20 min, C28A,C51A MSP was still able to bind to PS II preparations at molar stoichiometries similar to those of WT MSP and reconstitute O2 evolution activity. A fraction of the protein aggregates upon heating, but after resolubilization, it regains the ability to bind to PS II and reconstitute O2 evolution activity. Characterization of the solution structure of C28A,C51A MSP, using CD spectroscopy, UV absorption spectroscopy, and gel filtration chromatography, revealed that the mutant has a more disordered solution structure than WT MSP. The disulfide bond is therefore unnecessary for MSP function and the intrinsically disordered characteristics of MSP are not dependent on its presence. However, the disulfide bond does play a role in the solution structure of MSP in vivo, as evidenced by the lability of a C20S MSP mutation in Synechocystis 6803 [Burnap et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33: 13712-13718]. © Springer 2005.","Intrinsically disordered protein; Manganese-stabilizing protein; Oxygen evolution; Photosystem II","disulfide; photosystem II manganese stabilizing protein; photosystem II manganese-stabilizing protein; amino acid substitution; article; chemistry; circular dichroism; genetics; metabolism; mutation; photosystem II; protein binding; protein secondary structure; protein tertiary structure; structure activity relation; Amino Acid Substitution; Circular Dichroism; Disulfides; Mutation; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Structure-Activity Relationship; Synechocystis; Synechocystis sp.

(1999) Biochemistry 38: 404-414). A site-directed mutant of MSP, C28A, C51A, which lacks the -S-S- bridge, also binds to PS II at wild-type levels and reconstitutes oxygen evolution activity [Betts et al. (1996) Biochim Biophys Acta 1274: 135-142], although the mutant protein is even more disordered in solution. Both WT and C28A, C51A MSP aggregate upon heating, but an examination of the effects of protein concentration and pH on heat-induced aggregation showed that each MSP species exhibited greater resistance to aggregation at a pH near their pI (5.2) than do either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or carbonic anhydrase, which were used as model water soluble proteins. Increases in pH above the pI of the MSPs and BSA enhanced their aggregation resistance, a behavior which can be predicted from their charge (MSP) or a combination of charge and stabilization by -S-S- bonds (BSA). In the case of aggregation resistance by MSP, this is likely to be an important factor in its ability to avoid unproductive self-association reactions in favor of formation of the protein-protein interactions that lead to formation of the functional oxygen evolving complex. © Springer 2005.","Manganese stabilizing protein; Natively unfolded protein; Photosystem II; Thermostability","bovine serum albumin; carbonate dehydratase; disulfide; manganese; photosystem II manganese stabilizing protein; photosystem II manganese-stabilizing protein; animal; cattle; chemistry; circular dichroism; conference paper; genetics; heat; metabolism; pH; photosystem II; protein binding; protein denaturation; protein folding; site directed mutagenesis; Animals; Carbonic Anhydrases; Cattle; Circular Dichroism; Disulfides; Heat; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Manganese; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Protein Binding; Protein Denaturation; Protein Folding; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Bovinae",,"carbonate dehydratase, 9001-03-0; disulfide, 16734-12-6; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; Carbonic Anhydrases, EC 4.2.1.1; Disulfides; Manganese, 7439-96-5; photosystem II manganese-stabilizing protein; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Serum Albumin, Bovine",,,,"Ahmed, A., Tajmirriahi, H.A., Carpentier, R., A quantitative secondary structure-analysis of the 33-kDa extrinsic polypeptide of Photosystem-II by FTIR spectroscopy (1995) FEBS Lett, 363, pp. 65-68; Alexander, P., Hamilton, L.D.G., Changes in the reactivity of disulfide bonds in bovine serum albumin on denaturation (1960) Arch Biochem Biophys, 88, pp. 128-135; Betts, S.D., Hachigian, T.M., Pichersky, E., Yocum, C.F., Reconstitution of the spinach oxygen-evolving complex with recombinant Arabidopsis manganese-stabilizing protein (1994) Plant Mol Biol, 26, pp. 117-130; Betts, S.D., Ross, J.R., Hall, K.U., Pichersky, E., Yocum, C.F., Functional reconstitution of Photosystem II with recombinant manganese-stabilizing proteins containing mutations that remove the disulfide bridge (1996) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1274, pp. 135-142; Debus, R.J., The manganese and calcium-ions of photosynthetic oxygen evolution (1992) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1102, pp. 269-352; Denning, D.P., Uversky, V., Patel, S.S., Fink, A.L., Rexach, M., The Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleoporin Nup2p is a natively unfolded protein (2002) J Biol Chem, 277, pp. 33447-33455; Dunker, A.K., Lawson, J.D., Brown, C.J., Williams, R.M., Romero, P., Oh, J.S., Oldfield, C.J., Obradovic, Z., Intrinsically disordered protein (2001) J Mol Graph, 19, pp. 26-59; Hughes, W.L., Neurath, C.H., Bailey, K., Interstitial proteins: The proteins of blood plasma and lymph (1954) The Proteins: Chemistry, Biological Activity, and Methods, pp. 663-753. , Academic Press New York.

Powell develop polarity prior to the first embryonic cell division and retain a pattern of asymmetric growth during early embryogenesis. In order to identify F. distichus polypeptides secreted during asymmetric cell growth, we used a functional assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to screen a cDNA library generated from asymmetrically growing Fucus embryos for sequences encoding polypeptides that function as signal peptides for secretion. We isolated and sequenced 222 plasmids containing Fucus cDNAs encoding signal peptide activity. The cDNA inserts from these plasmids were translated in silico into 244 potential polypeptide sequences, 169 of which are predicted to contain signal peptides. BlastP analysis of the Fucus sequences revealed similarity between many Fucus proteins and cell surface proteins that function in development in other eukaryotes, including epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat-containing proteins, plant leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-receptor kinases, and algal β-1, 3-exoglucanase. However, most of the isolated Fucus polypeptides lack similarity to known proteins. The isolation of cDNAs encoding secreted Fucus proteins provides an important step toward characterizing cell surface proteins important for asymmetric organization and growth in fucoid embryos.","EGF-like repeats; Fucus; Glucanase; Polarity; Secretion; Signal peptide","Bioassay; DNA; Enzymes; Polypeptides; Cell growth; Plants (botany); epidermal growth factor; protein kinase; signal peptide; amino acid sequence; article; chemistry; Fucus; gene library; genetic transformation; genetics; molecular genetics; physiology; plasmid; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence alignment; sequence homology; signal transduction; Amino Acid Sequence; Epidermal Growth Factor; Fucus; Gene Library; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Protein Kinases; Protein Sorting Signals; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Signal Transduction; Transformation, Genetic; algae; Distichus; Eukaryota; Fucus; Fucus distichus; insertion sequences; Phaeophyceae; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"epidermal growth factor, 62229-50-9; protein kinase, 9026-43-1; Epidermal Growth Factor, 62229-50-9; Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Protein Sorting Signals",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J Mol Biol, 215, pp. 403-410; An, Y.Q., McDowell, J.M., Huang, S., McKinney, E.C., Chambliss, S., Meagher, R.B., Strong, constitutive expression of the Arabidopsis ACT2/ACT8 actin subclass in vegetative tissues (1996) Plant J, 10, pp. 107-121; Appel, R.D., Bairoch, A., Hochstrasser, D.F., A new generation of information retrieval tools for biologists: The example of the ExPASy WWW server (1994) Trends Biochem Sci, 19, pp. 258-260; Apt, K.E., Clendennen, S.K., Powers, D.A., Grossman, A.R., The gene family encoding the fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins from the brown alga Macrocystis pyrifera (1995) Mol Gen Genet, 246, pp. 455-464; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K.J., (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , Wiley, New York, chpt 13; Belanger, K.D., Quatrano, R.S., Polarity: The role of localized secretion (2000) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 3, pp. 67-72; Belanger, K.D., Quatrano, R.S., Membrane recycling occurs during asymmetric tip growth and cell plate formation in Fucus distichus zygotes (2000) Protoplasma, 212, pp. 24-37; Bork, P., Downing, A.K., Kieffer, B., Campbell, I.D., Structure and distribution of modules in extracellular proteins (1996) Q Rev Biophys, 29, pp. 119-167; Brawley, S.H., Quatrano, R.S., Sulfation of fucoidin in Fucus embryos. 4.

New data on the secondary structure of C-terminal mutants and 90°C-heated manganese stabilizing protein, along with earlier data on the secondary structure of N-terminal mutants and the tertiary structure of all modified MSP species, allow for an evaluation of models for spinach MSP secondary and tertiary structure. This summary of previous and new information better documents the natively unfolded behavior of the protein in solution. A two-step mechanism for binding of manganese stabilizing protein to Photosystem II is discussed and possible solution three-dimensional conformations of the wild-type protein and some of its unfolded mutants, are proposed.","CD spectra; Gel filtration; Heating; Manganese stabilizing protein; Natively unfolded protein; Photosystem II; Site-directed mutagenesis","Spinacia oleracea",,,,,,"Ahmed, A., Tajmirriahi, H.A., Carpentier, R., A quantitative secondary structure analysis of the 33-kDa extrinsic polypeptide of Photosystem II by FTIR spectroscopy (1995) FEBS Lett, 363, pp. 65-68; Anati, R., Adir, N., Crystalization of dimers of the manganese-stabilizing protein of Photosystem II (2000) Photosynth Res, 64, pp. 167-177; Betts, S.D., Hachigian, T.M., Pichersky, E., Yocum, C.F., Reconstitution of the spinach oxygen-evolving complex with recombinant Arabidopsis manganese-stabilizing protein (1994) Plant Mol Biol, 26, pp. 117-130; Betts, S.D., Ross, J.R., Hall, K.U., Pichersky, E., Yocum, C.F., Functional reconstitution of Photosystem II with recombinant manganese-stabilizing proteins containing mutations that remove the disulfide bridge (1996) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1274, pp. 135-142; Betts, S.D., Ross, J.R., Pichersky, E., Yocum, C.F., Cold-sensitive assembly of a mutant manganese-stabilizing protein caused by a Val to Ala replacement (1996) Biochemistry, 35, pp. 6302-6307; Betts, S.D., Ross, J.R., Pichersky, E., Yocum, C.F., Mutation Val235Ala weakens binding of the 33-kDa manganese stabilizing protein of Photosystem II to one of two sites (1997) Biochemistry, 36, pp. 4047-4053; Betts, S.D., Lydakis-Simantiris, N., Ross, J.R., Yocum, C.F., The carboxyl-terminal tripeptide of the manganese-stabilizing protein is required for quantitative assembly into Photosystem II and for high rates of oxygen evolution activity (1998) Biochemistry, 37, pp. 14230-14236; Bricker, T.M., Frankel, L.K., The structure and function of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein of Photosystem II: A critical assessment (1998) Photosynth Res, 56, pp. 157-173; Bricker, T.M., Odom, W.R., Queirolo, C.B., Close association of the 33-kDa extrinsic protein with the apoprotein of cpal in photosystem II (1988) FEBS Lett, 231, pp. 111-117; Burnap, R.L., Sherman, L.A., Deletion mutagenesis in Synechocystis Sp PCC6803 indicates that the Mn-stabilizing protein of Photosystem II is not essential for O2 evolution (1991) Biochemistry, 30, pp. 440-446; Burnap, R.L., Qian, M., Shen, J.R., Inoue, Y., Sherman, L.A., Role of disulfide linkage and putative intermolecular binding residues in the stability and binding of the extrinsic manganese stabilizing protein to the Photosystem II reaction center (1994) Biochemistry, 33, pp. 13712-13718; Debus, R.J., The manganese and calcium ions of photosynthetic oxygen evolution (1992) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1102, pp. 269-352; Debus, R.J., The polypeptides of Photosystem II and their influence on manganotryosyl-based oxygen evolution (2000) Manganese and its Role in Biological Processes, 37, pp. 657-711. , Sigel A and Sigel H (eds).

Previous work with the bovine SULT1A1 has utilized the highly fluorescent substrate 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HC, umbelliferone) as an acceptor substrate [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 261 (1999) 815]. Here we report that adenosine-3′,5′-bisphosphate (PAP)-dependent binding of 7-HC to bSULT1A1 can be observed due to the appearance of a 400-420-nm shoulder in the emission spectrum, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. This emission was observed by placing 7-HC in ethanol, which is consistent with bSULT1A1 phenol binding site hydrophobicity. Titrations with 7-HC indicate a Kd for 7-HC of 0.58 μM and substoichiometric binding to the homodimeric enzyme. The bSULT1A1:PAP:7-HC complex could be disrupted with pentachlorophenol (PCP), titrations with which indicated 0.5 equivalents per enzyme subunit. Titrations of enzyme plus 7-HC with PAP also indicated 0.5 equivalents per enzyme subunit. These results suggest a model of homodimeric bSULT1A1 in which subunit interactions favor half-site reactivity in the formation of a dead end complex. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
