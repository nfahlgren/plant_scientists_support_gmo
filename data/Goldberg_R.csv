Young Dr. East, Los Angeles, CA, United States","Little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which the embryo proper and suspensor of plant embryos activate specific gene sets shortly after fertilization. We analyzed the upstream region of the Scarlet Runner Bean (Phaseolus coccineus) G564 gene in order to understand how genes are activated specifically in the suspensor during early embryo development. Previously, we showed that a 54-bp fragment of the G564 upstream region is sufficient for suspensor transcription and contains at least three required cis-regulatory sequences, including the 10-bp motif (5′-GAAAAGCGAA-3′), the 10 bp-like motif (5′-GAAAAACGAA-3′), and Region 2 motif (partial sequence 5′-TTGGT-3′). Here, we use site-directed mutagenesis experiments in transgenic tobacco globular-stage embryos to identify two additional cis-regulatory elements within the 54-bp cis-regulatory module that are required for G564 suspensor transcription: the Fifth motif (5′-GAGTTA-3′) and a third 10-bp-related sequence (5′-GAAAACCACA-3′). Further deletion of the 54-bp fragment revealed that a 47-bp fragment containing the five motifs (the 10-bp, 10-bp-like, 10-bp-related, Region 2 and Fifth motifs) is sufficient for suspensor transcription, and represents a cis-regulatory module. A consensus sequence for each type of motif was determined by comparing motif sequences shown to activate suspensor transcription. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the regulation of G564 is evolutionarily conserved. A homologous cis-regulatory module was found upstream of the G564 ortholog in the Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), indicating that the regulation of G564 is evolutionarily conserved in closely related bean species. © 2015, The Author(s).","Cis-regulatory elements;

Historically, the giant embryo of scarlet runner bean (SRB), Phaseolus coccineus, has been used as a model system to investigate the physiological events that occur early in embryogenesis—focusing on the question of what role the suspensor region plays. A major feature distinguishing SRB embryos from those of other plants is a highly enlarged suspensor containing at least 200 cells that synthesize growth regulators required for subsequent embryonic development. Recent studies have exploited the giant size of the SRB embryo to micro-dissect the embryo proper and suspensor regions in order to use genomics-based approaches to identify regulatory genes that may be involved in controlling suspensor and embryo proper differentiation, as well as the cellular processes that may be unique to each embryonic region. Here we review the current genomics resources that make SRB embryos a compelling model system for studying the early events required to program embryo development. © 2015 Henry and Goldberg.","Cis-regulatory elements; Comparative genomics; Gene regulatory network; Phaseolus coccineus; Scarlet runner bean; Suspensor; Transcriptome",,,,,,,"Alpi, A., Tognoni, F., Damato, F., Growth-regulator levels in embryo and suspensor of Phaseolus coccineus at 2 stages of development (1975) Planta, 127, pp. 153-162; Bayer, M., Nawy, T., Giglione, C., Galli, M., Meinnel, T., Lukowitz, W., Paternal control of embryonic patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana (2009) Science, 323, pp. 1485-1488; Belmonte, M.F., Kirkbride, R.C., Stone, S.L., Pelletier, J.M., Bui, A.Q., Yeung, E.C., Comprehensive developmental profiles of gene activity in regions and subregions of the Arabidopsis seed (2013) Proc.

While our understanding of seed development is becoming clearer, current understanding of the genetics and cellular mechanisms that contribute to funiculus development is limited. Using laser microdissection combined with global RNA-profiling experiments we compared the genetic profiles of all maternal and zygotic regions and subregions during seed development. We found that the funiculus is a dynamic region of the seed that is enriched for mRNAs associated with hormone metabolism, molecular transport, and metabolic activities corresponding to biological processes that have yet to be described in this maternal seed structure. We complemented our genetic data with a complete histological analysis of the funiculus from the earliest stages of development through to seed maturation at the light and electron microscopy levels. The anatomy revealed signs of photosynthesis, the endomembrane system, cellular respiration, and transport within the funiculus, all of which supported data from the transcriptional analysis. Finally, we studied the transcriptional programming of the funiculus compared to other seed subregions throughout seed development. Using newly designed in silico algorithms, we identified a number of transcriptional networks hypothesized to be responsible for biological processes like auxin response and glucosinolate biosynthesis found specifically within the funiculus. Taken together, patterns of gene activity and histological observations reveal putative functions of the understudied funiculus region and identify predictive transcriptional circuits underlying these biological processes in space and time. Significance Statement The Arabidopsis funiculus is an integral and dynamic region of the seed. Dominant patterns of gene activity reveal similarities and differences in biological processes between the funiculus and all other seed regions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Arabidopsis thaliana; chalazal seed coat; funiculus; laser microdissection; seed; seed coat; transcriptome","Biochemistry; Bioinformatics; Complex networks; Genetic programming; Metabolism; Microdissection; Mobile security; Arabidopsis thaliana; Funiculus; Laser micro dissections; Seed coats; Transcriptomes; Seed; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana","GENBANK: GSE12404, GSE20039",,,,"NSERC, National Stroke Foundation; NSF, National Stroke Foundation","Augustine, R., Mukhopadhyay, A., Bisht, N.C., Targeted silencing of BjMYB28 transcription factor gene directs development of low glucosinolate lines in oilseed Brassica juncea (2013) Plant Biotechnol.

We show that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor genes represented by Glyma04g41710 and its paralogs are required for the formation of stoma in leaves and stomatal precursor complexes in mature embryo cotyledons. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these bHLH transcription factor genes are orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SPEECHLESS (SPCH) that initiate asymmetric cell divisions in the leaf protoderm layer and establish stomatal cell lineages. Soybean SPCH (GmSPCH) mRNAs accumulate primarily in embryo, seedling, and leaf epidermal layers. Expression of Glyma04g41710 under the control of the SPCH promoter rescues the Arabidopsis spch mutant, indicating that Glyma04g41710 is a functional ortholog of SPCH. Developing soybean embryos do not form mature stoma, and stomatal differentiation is arrested at the guard mothercellstage.WeanalyzedtheaccumulationofGmSPCH mRNAs during soybean seed development and mRNAs orthologous to MUTE, FAMA,and INDUCER OF C-REPEAT/DEHYDRATION RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTOR EXPRESSION1/SCREAM2 that are required for stoma formation in Arabidopsis. The mRNA accumulation patterns provide a potential explanation for guard mother cell dormancy in soybean embryos. Our results suggest that variation in the timing of bHLH transcription factor gene expression can explain the diversity of stomatal forms observed during plant development. © 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Background: Previous studies have identified awkward wrist posture as a risk factor for wrist tendinosis, though the magnitude of the relationship is unclear. Method: Workers (N = 413) at four industries were followed for up to 28 months with questionnaires and physical examinations every 4 months. Individualized exposure assessments of wrist posture were based on video analysis to determine the wrist extension/flexion angle for up to four tasks. Posture measures were calculated while in ""heavy pinch"" (> 1 kg force), ""heavy power grip"" (> 4 kg force), and across ""all grips."" A proportional hazards model estimated the relationship between timeweighted average posture measures and incidence of dominant-side wrist tendinosis. Results: In a model based on tertiles of exposure, adjusted for age, gender, hand force, and repetition of exertions, risk of tendinosis more than doubled in the highest category (HR = 2.69, 95% CI = 1.01-7.21) across all grips. The relative risk was highest during heavy pinch (HR = 5.03, 95% CI = 0.74-34.05), though not statistically significant. Increased median wrist extension while in heavy power grip was protective (HR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.06-0.94). Conclusion: In this study of production workers, median wrist flexion of more than 7°, across all grips, was associated with an increased risk of tendinosis. The protective findings on median wrist extension during power grip deserve further investigation. Work tasks and tools should be designed to prevent sustained wrist flexion, especially during tasks involving forceful pinch.

Despite the importance of seeds for food, fiber, and fuel globally, little is known of the cellular processes that characterize each subregion or how these processes are integrated to permit the coordinated development of the seed. We profiled gene activity genome-wide in every organ, tissue, and cell type of Arabidopsis seeds from fertilization through maturity. The resulting mRNA datasets offer the most comprehensive description of gene activity in seeds with high spatial and temporal resolution, providing unique insights into the function of understudied seed regions. Global comparisons of mRNA populations reveal unexpected overlaps in the functional identities of seed subregions. Analyses of coexpressed gene sets suggest that processes that regulate seed size and filling are coordinated across several subregions. Predictions of gene regulatory networks based on the association of transcription factors with enriched DNA sequence motifs upstream of coexpressed genes identify regulators of seed development. These studies emphasize the utility of these datasets as an essential resource for the study of seed biology.","Laser-capture microdissection; MRNA localization; Transcriptome","messenger RNA; Arabidopsis; article; carbon metabolism; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; fatty acid synthesis; fertilization; gene activity; gene expression; gene regulatory network; genetic association; gluconeogenesis; glycolysis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant seed; priority journal; protein degradation; seed development; seed size; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cluster Analysis; Endosperm; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plants, Genetically Modified; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Seeds","GENBANK: GSE12404","Arabidopsis Proteins; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9",,,,"Steeves, T.A., The evolution and biological significance of seeds (1983) Can J Bot, 61 (12), pp. 3550-3560; Godfray, H.C.J., Food security: The challenge of feeding 9 billion people (2010) Science, 327 (5967), pp. 812-818; Ohto, M., Stone, S.L., Harada, J.J., Genetic control of seed development and seed mass (2007) Seed Development, Dormancy, and Germination, pp. 1-24. , Bradford KJ, Nonogaki H Blackwell, Oxford; Brown, R.C., Lemmon, B.E., Nguyen, H., Olsen, O.-A., Development of endosperm in Arabidopsis thaliana (1999) Sexual Plant Reproduction, 12 (1), pp. 32-42. , DOI 10.1007/s004970050169; Le, B.H., Global analysis of gene activity during Arabidopsis seed development and identification of seed-specific transcription factors (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 107 (18), pp. 8063-8070; Harada, J.J., Pelletier, J., Genome-wide analyses of gene activity during seed development (2012) Seed Sci Res, 22 (SUPPL.

However, most of our knowledge of MTI comes from studies of model systems with relatively little work done with crop plants. In this work, we report on variation in both the microbe-associated molecular patterntriggered oxidative burst and gene expression across four soybean (Glycine max) genotypes. Variation in MTI correlated with the level of pathogen resistance for each genotype. A quantitative trait locus analysis on these traits identified four loci that appeared to regulate gene expression during MTI in soybean. Likewise, we observed that both MTI variation and pathogen resistance were quantitatively inherited. The approach utilized in this study may have utility for identifying key resistance loci useful for developing improved soybean cultivars. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.

We report findings from a prospective study of right wrist tendinosis among blue-collar workers. Methods Workers (N=413) at four industries were followed for 28 months with questionnaires and physical examinations every 4 months to identify incident cases of right wrist tendinosis. Exposure assessment of force and repetition were based on field measurements and video analysis to determine repetition rate and the percent time (% time) in heavy pinch (>1 kg-force) or power grip (>4 kg-force). All exposure variables were measured at the level of the individual and task. For workers responsible for >1 task, a time-weighted average exposure was calculated based on task hours per week. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between exposures and incidence of wrist tendinosis. Results During the 481 person-years of follow-up, there were 26 incident cases of right wrist tendinosis [incidence rate (IR) 5.40 cases per 100 person-years]. Adjusting for age, gender, and repetition, wrist tendinosis was associated with % time spent in heavy pinch [hazard ratio (HR) 5.01, 95% CI 1.27-19.79]. Composite exposure measure American Conference of Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value (ACGIH-TLV) for hand activity level (HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.52-10.26) was also associated with the outcome for the medium-exposure group using video-based total repetition rate. Conclusions The workplace factors predicting wrist tendinosis were time-weighted average values of % time spent in heavy pinch and the ACGIH-TLV for Hand Activity Level. The % time spent in power grip was not a significant predictor, nor were any measures of repetition. An exposure-response relationship was observed for the % time spent in heavy pinch. These findings may improve programs for preventing occupational wrist tendinosis.","Exposure-response; Force; MSD; Musculoskeletal disorder; Occupational; Prospective study; Repetition; Upper extremity","age; biomechanics; disability; disease control; disease incidence; force; gender role; health impact; health policy; muscle; occupational exposure; questionnaire survey; workplace; adult; article; blue collar worker; exposure variable; female; follow up; hand movement; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; occupational disease; pinch strength; power grip; prediction; priority journal; risk factor; tendinitis; United States; workplace; wrist disease; California; San Francisco; United States",,,,,,"Silverstein, B.A., Fine, L.J., Armstrong, T.J., Hand wrist cumulative trauma disorders in industry (1986) British Journal of Industrial Medicine, 43, pp. 779-784; Webster, B.S., The cost of compensable upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders (1994) J Occup Med, 36 (7), pp. 713-717; Silverstein, B., Nelson, N., Kalat, J., Claims incidence of work-related disorders of the upper extremities: Washington state, 1987 through 1995 (1998) Am J Public Health, 88, pp. 1827-1833. , doi:10.2105/AJPH.88.12.1827; Armstrong, T.J., Fine, L.J., Goldstein, S.A., Lifshitz, Y.R., Silverstein, B.A., Ergonomics considerations in hand and wrist tendonitis (1987) The Journal of Hand Surgery, 12 A, pp. 830-837; Morse, T., Dillon, C., Kenta-Bibi, E., Weber, J., Diva, U., Warren, N., Grey, M., Trends in work-related musculoskeletal disorder reports by year, type, and industrial sector: A capture-recapture analysis (2005) American Journal of Industrial Medicine, 48 (1), pp. 40-49. , doi:10.1002/ajim.20182; Fan, J.Z., Bonauto, D.K., Foley, M.P., Silverstein, B.A., Underreporting of Work-Related Injury or Illness to Workers' Compensation: Individual and Industry Factors (2006) J Occup Environ Med, 48, pp. 914-922. , doi:10.1097/01.jom.0000226253.54138.1; Leclerc, A., Landre, M.-F., Chastang, J.-F., Niedhammer, I., Roquelaure, Y., Upper-limb disorders in repetitive work (2001) Scand J Work Environ Health, 27, pp. 268-278; Thomsen, J.F., Mikkelsen, S., Andersen, J.H., Fallentin, N., Loft, I.P., Frost, P., Overgaard, E., Risk factors for hand-wrist disorders in repetitive work (2007) Occup Environ Med, 64 (8), pp. 527-533. , doi:10.1136/oem.2005.021170; Descatha, A., Roquelaure, Y., Evanoff, B., Leclerc, M., Predictive Factors for Incident Musculoskeletal Disorders in an In-Plant Surveillance Program (2007) Ann Occup Hyg, 51 (3), pp. 337-344. , doi:10.1093/annhyg/mel080; Latko, W.A., Franzblau, A., Ulin, S.S., Werner, R.A., Albers, J.W., Cross-sectional study of the relationship between repetitive work and the prevalence of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders (1999) American Journal of Industrial Medicine, 36 (2), pp. 248-259. , doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199908)36:2<248::AID-AJIM4>3.0.CO;2-Q; Silverstein, B.A., Fine, L.J., Armstrong, T.J., Occupational factors and carpal tunnel syndrome (1987) American Journal of Industrial Medicine, 11, pp. 343-358. , doi:10.1002/ajim.4700110310; Knox, K., Moore, J.S., Predictive Validity of the Strain Index in Turkey Processing (2001) Journal of Occupational & Environmental Medicine, 43 (5), pp. 451-462. , doi:10.1097/00043764-200105000-00005; Franzblau, A., Armstrong, T.J., Werner, R.A., Ulin, S.S., A Cross-Sectional Assessment of the ACGIH TLV for Hand Activity Level (2005) Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation, 15 (1), pp. 7-67. , doi:10.1007/s10926-005-0874-z; Gerr, F., Marcus, M., Ensor, C., Kleinbaum, D., Cohen, S., Edwards, A., Gentry, E., Monteilh, C.A., Prospective Study of Computer Users: I (2002) Study Design and Incidence of Musculoskeletal Symptoms and Disorders, 41, pp. 221-235; Rempel, D.M., Krause, N., Goldberg, R., Benner, D., Hudes, M., Goldner, G.U., A randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of two workstation interventions on upper body pain and incident musculoskeletal disorders among computer operators (2006) Occup Environ Med, 63 (5), pp. 300-306. , May doi:10.1136/oem.2005.022285; Bao, S., Spielholz, P., Howard, N., Silverstein, B., Quantifying repetitive hand activity for epidemiological research on musculoskeletal disorders.

We report findings from a prospective study of right wrist tendinosis among blue-collar workers. Workers (N=413) at four industries were followed for 28 months with questionnaires and physical examinations every 4 months to identify incident cases of right wrist tendinosis. Exposure assessment of force and repetition were based on field measurements and video analysis to determine repetition rate and the percent time (% time) in heavy pinch (>1 kg-force) or power grip (>4 kg-force). All exposure variables were measured at the level of the individual and task. For workers responsible for >1 task, a time-weighted average exposure was calculated based on task hours per week. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between exposures and incidence of wrist tendinosis. During the 481 person-years of follow-up, there were 26 incident cases of right wrist tendinosis [incidence rate (IR) 5.40 cases per 100 person-years]. Adjusting for age, gender, and repetition, wrist tendinosis was associated with % time spent in heavy pinch [hazard ratio (HR) 5.01, 95% CI 1.27-19.79). Composite exposure measure American Conference of Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value (ACGIH-TLV) for hand activity level (HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.52-10.26) was also associated with the outcome for the medium-exposure group using video-based total repetition rate.

To identify TF genes expressed at specific stages of seed development, including those unique to seeds, we used Affymetrix GeneChips to profile Arabidopsis genes active in seeds fromfertilization throughmaturation and at other times of the plant life cycle. Seedgenesetswerecomparedwith thoseexpressed in prefertilization ovules, germinating seedlings, and leaves, roots, stems, and floral buds of themature plant.Most genes active in seeds are shared by all stages of seed development, although significant quantitative changes in gene activity occur. Each stage of seed development has a small gene set that is either specific at the level of the GeneChipor up-regulated with respect to genes active at other stages, including those that encode TFs. We identified 289 seed-specific genes, including 48 that encode TFs. Seven of the seed-specific TF genes are known regulators of seed development and include the LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC) genes LEC1, LEC1-LIKE, LEC2, and FUS3. The rest represent different classes of TFs with unknown roles in seed development. Promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion experiments and seed mRNA localization GeneChip datasets showed that the seed-specific TF genes are active in different compartments and tissues of the seed at unique times of development. Collectively, these seed-specific TF genes should facilitate the identification of regulatory networks that are important for programming seed development.","Embryo; mRNA localization; Transcriptome","beta glucuronidase; messenger RNA; transcription factor; Arabidopsis; article; cotyledon; experiment; fertilization; flora; fusion gene; gene activity; gene expression profiling; gene identification; genetic analysis; germination; life cycle; nonhuman; ovule; plant gene; plant leaf; plant root; priority journal; seed development; upregulation; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phenotype; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Transcription Factors; Arabidopsis",,"beta glucuronidase, 9001-45-0; Arabidopsis Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Factors",,,,"Goldberg, R.B., De Paiva, G., Yadegari, R., Plant embryogenesis: Zygote to seed (1994) Science, 266, pp. 605-614; Raghavan, V., (2006) Double Fertilization: Embryo and Endosperm Development in Flowering Plants, , Springer, Berlin; Goldberg, R.B., Barker, S.J., Perez-Grau, L., Regulation of gene expression during plant embryogenesis (1989) Cell, 56, pp. 149-160; Harada, J.J., (1997) Seed Maturation and the Control of Germination.

Most seed-bearing plant embryos contain suspensor regions, which occur in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, and suspensor-like structures are present in the embryos of some lower land plants. Recent technological advances, including novel genomics approaches, have provided insights into the function of the suspensor and the DNA sequences that control suspensor-specific gene expression. The molecular mechanisms controlling embryo basal-cell lineage specification and suspensor differentiation events are also beginning to be illuminated. Here, we summarize the role of the suspensor in plant embryogenesis and discuss future directions of suspensor biology, including the dissection of suspensor gene regulatory networks. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that AP2 influences development of the three major seed compartments: embryo, endosperm, and seed coat. AP2 appears to have a significant effect on endosperm development. ap2 mutant seeds undergo an extended period of rapid endosperm growth early in development relative to wild type. This early expanded growth period in ap2 seeds is associated with delayed endosperm cellularization and overgrowth of the endosperm central vacuole. The subsequent period of moderate endosperm growth is also extended in ap2 seeds largely due to persistent cell divisions at the endosperm periphery. The effect of AP2 on endosperm development is mediated by different mechanisms than parent-of-origin effects on seed size observed in interploidy crosses. Seed coat development is affected; integument cells of ap2 mutants are more elongated than wild type. We conclude that endosperm overgrowth and/or integument cell elongation create a larger postfertilization embryo sac into which the ap2 embryo can grow. Morphological development of the embryo is initially delayed in ap2 compared with wild-type seeds, but ap2 embryos become larger than wild type after the bent-cotyledon stage of development. ap2 embryos are able to fill the enlarged postfertilization embryo sac, because they undergo extended periods of cell proliferation and seed filling.

We analyzed the upstream region of the scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) G564 gene to understand how genes are activated specifically within the suspensor during early embryo development. Previously, we showed that the G564 upstream region has a block of tandem repeats, which contain a conserved 10-bp motif (GAAAAGC/TGAA), and that deletion of these repeats results in a loss of suspensor transcription. Here, we use gain-of-function (GOF) experiments with transgenic globular-stage tobacco embryos to show that only 1 of the 5 tandem repeats is required to drive suspensor-specific transcription. Fine-scale deletion and scanning mutagenesis experiments with 1 tandem repeat uncovered a 54-bp region that contains all of the sequences required to activate transcription in the suspensor, including the 10-bp motif (GAAAAGCGAA) and a similar 10-bp-like motif (GAAAAACGAA). Site-directed mutagenesis and GOF experiments indicated that both the 10-bp and 10-bp-like motifs are necessary, but not sufficient to activate transcription in the suspensor, and that a sequence (TTGGT) between the 10-bp and the 10-bp-like motifs is also necessary for suspensor transcription. Together, these data identify sequences that are required to activate transcription in the suspensor of a plant embryo after fertilization. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Promoter analysis;

Here, we analyze the cellular processes induced by LEC2, a B3 domain transcription factor, that may underlie its ability to promote somatic embryogenesis. We show auxin-responsive genes are induced after LEC2 activation in seedlings. Genes encoding enzymes involved in auxin biosynthesis, YUC2 and YUC4, are activated within 1 h after induction of LEC2 activity, and YUC4 appears to be a direct transcriptional target of LEC2. We also show ectopic LEC2 expression induces accumulation of seed storage protein and oil bodies in vegetative and reproductive organs, events that normally occur during the maturation phase of embryogenesis. Furthermore, LEC2 activates seed protein genes before an increase in RNAs encoding LEC1 or FUS3 is observed. Thus, LEC2 causes rapid changes in auxin responses and induces cellular differentiation characteristic of the maturation phase. The relevance of these changes to the ability of LEC2 to promote somatic embryogenesis is discussed. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Seed development; Totipotency","Arabidopsis protein;

The new system provides support for both horizontal and vertical arm motion. A total of 11 participants performed ten tasks (five seated and five standing) both with and without the arm support. Outcomes were assessed with electromyography and subjective feedback. Muscle activity was measured over the dominant side supraspinatus, triceps and forearm extensor muscles. Significant (p < 0.01) reductions in static muscle activity were observed in one of ten tasks performed with the support device for the supraspinatus muscle, in five tasks for the triceps and in one task for forearm extensor muscles. Likewise, a significant improvement in subjective measures was reported with the support device for 'ease of task' for two of ten tasks, for 'forearm comfort' for three of ten tasks and for 'shoulder effort' for six of ten tasks. The results suggest that a dynamic forearm support may improve subjective comfort and reduce static muscle loads in the upper extremity for tasks that involve horizontal movement of the arms. For rapid motions, the value of the support is limited due to internal inertia and friction.","Electromyography; Forearm; Muscle load; Shoulder; Support","Biofeedback; Biomechanics; Electromyography; Friction; Muscle; Dynamic arm support; Hand/arm tasks; Muscle loads; Ergonomics; adult; arm movement; arm muscle; article; controlled study; electromyography; extensor muscle; female; human; human experiment; job performance; male; muscle contraction; muscle disease; occupational disease; occupational hazard; occupational safety; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; sitting; standing; task performance; triceps brachii muscle; Adult; Arm Injuries; Biomechanics; Electromyography; Female; Hand Injuries; Human Engineering; Humans; Male; Microcomputers; Middle Aged; Muscle Fatigue; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Occupational Diseases; Pain Threshold; Physical Endurance; Posture; Protective Devices; Task Performance and Analysis",,,,,,"Aaras, A., Fostervold, K., Ro, O., Thoresen, M., Larsen, S., Postural load during VDU work: A comparison between various work postures (1997) Ergonomics, 40, pp. 1255-1268; Erdelyi, A., Sihvonen, T., Helin, P., Hanninen, O., Shoulder strain in keyboard workers and its alleviation by arm supports (1988) International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 60, pp. 119-124; Feng, Y., Grooten, W., Wretenburg, P., Arborelius, U., Effects of arm support on shoulder and arm muscle activity during sedentary work (1997) Ergonomics, 40, pp. 834-848; Feng, Y., Grooten, W., Wretenberg, P., Arborelius, U., Effects of arm suspension in simulated assembly line work: Muscular activity and posture angles (1999) Applied Ergonomics, 30, pp. 247-253; Hagberg, M., Jonsson, B., The amplitude distribution of the myoelectric signal in an ergonomic study of the deltoid muscle (1975) Ergonomics, 18, pp. 311-319; (2000) ISO9241-9, Ergonomic Requirements for Office Work With Visual Display Terminals (VDTs) - Part 9: Requirements for Non-keyboard Input Devices, , International Standards Organization International Standards Organization, Geneva; Jarvholm, U., Palmerud, G., Kadefors, R., Herberts, P., The effect of arm support on supraspinatus muscle load during simulated assembly work and welding (1991) Ergonomics, 34, pp. 57-66; Lintula, M., Nevala-Puranen, N., Louhevaara, V., Effects of Ergorest arm supports on muscle strain and wrist positions during the use of the mouse and keyboard in work with visual display units: A work site intervention (2001) International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics, 7, pp. 103-116; Marcus, M., Gerr, F., Monteilh, C., Ortiz, D., Gentry, E., Cohen, S., Edwards, A., Kleinbaum, D., A prospective study of computer users: II.

DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) is the primary maintenance DNA methyltransferase in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Reciprocal crosses between antisense MET1 transgenic and wild-type plants show that DNA hypomethylation has a parent-of-origin effect on seed size. However, due to the dominant nature of the antisense MET1 transgene, the parent with a hypomethylated genome, its gametophyte, and both the maternal and paternal genomes of the F1 seed become hypomethylated. Thus, the distinct role played by hypomethylation at each generation is not known. To address this issue, we examined F, seed from reciprocal crosses using a loss-of-function recessive null allele, met1-6. Crosses between wild-type and homozygous met1-6 parents show that hypomethylated maternal and paternal genomes result in significantly larger and smaller F1 seeds, respectively. Our analysis of crosses between wild-type and heterozygous MET1/met1-6 parents revealed that hypomethylation in the female or male gametophytic generation was sufficient to influence F1 seed size. A recessive mutation in another gene that dramatically reduces DNA methylation, DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1, also causes parent-of-origin effects on F1 seed size. By contrast, recessive mutations in genes that regulate a smaller subset of DNA methylation (CHROMOMETHYLASE3 and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASES1 and 2) had little effect on seed size. Collectively, these results show that maternal and paternal genomes play distinct roles in the regulation of seed size in Arabidopsis. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"DNA; Genes; Gametophytic generation; Gene imprinting; Hypomethylation; Seed; Arabidopsis protein; DDM1 protein, Arabidopsis; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase; DNA binding protein; MET1 protein, Arabidopsis; transcription factor; Arabidopsis; article; DNA methylation; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome; germ cell; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; plant seed; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase; DNA Methylation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Germ Cells; Plants, Genetically Modified; Seeds; Transcription Factors; Enzymes; Genes; Nucleic Acids; Seeds; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; DDM1 protein, Arabidopsis; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.37; DNA-Binding Proteins; MET1 protein, Arabidopsis, EC 2.1.1.-; Transcription Factors",,,,"Adams, S., Vinkenoog, R., Spielman, M., Dickinson, H.G., Scott, R.J., Parent-of-origin effects on seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana require DNA methylation (2000) Development, 127, pp. 2493-2502; Baroux, C., Gagliardini, V., Page, D.R., Grossniklaus, U., Dynamic regulatory interactions of Polycomb group genes: MEDEA autoregulation is required for imprinted gene expression in Arabidopsis (2006) Genes Dev, 20, pp. 1081-1086; Bartee, L., Malagnac, F., Bender, J., Arabidopsis cmt3 chromomethylase mutations block non-CG methylation and silencing of an endogenous gene (2001) Genes Dev, 15, pp. 1753-1758; Bender, J., DNA methylation and epigenetics (2004) Annu Rev Plant Biol, 55, pp. 41-68; Bestor, T.H., The DNA methyltransferases of mammals (2000) Hum Mol Genet, 14, pp. 2395-2402; Bird, A.P., Wolffe, A.P., Methylation-induced repression-belts, braces, and chromatin (1999) Cell, 99, pp. 451-454; Brown, R.C., Lemmon, B.E., Methods in plant immunolight microscopy (1995) Methods Cell Biol, 49, pp. 85-107; Brown, R.C., Lemmon, B.E., Nguyen, H., Olsen, O.-A., Development of endosperm in Arabidopsis thaliana (1999) Sex Plant Reprod, 12, pp. 32-42; Cao, X., Aufsatz, W., Zilberman, D., Mette, M.F., Huang, M.S., Matzke, M., Jacobsen, S.E., Role of the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferases in RNA-directed DNA methylation (2003) Curr Biol, 13, pp. 2212-2217; Cao, X., Jacobsen, S.E., Locus-specific control of asymmetric and CpNpG methylation by the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferase genes (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 99, pp. 16491-16498; Cao, X., Jacobsen, S.E., Role of the Arabidopsis DRM methyltransferases in de novo DNA methylation and gene silencing (2002) Curr Biol, 12, pp. 1138-1144; Chan, S.W.-L., Henderson, I.R., Jacobsen, S.E., Gardening the genome: DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana (2005) Nat Rev Genet, 6, pp. 351-360; Chan, S.W.-L., Henderson, I.R., Zhang, X., Shah, G., Chien, J.S.-C., Jacobsen, S.E., RNAi, DRD1, and histone methylation actively target developmentally important npn-CG DNA methylation in Arabidopsis (2006) PLoS Genet, 2, pp. 791-797; Chen, T., Li, E., Establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns in mammals (2006) Curr Top Microbiol Immunol, 301, pp. 179-201; Dilkes, B.P., Comai, L., A differential dosage hypothesis for parental effects in seed development (2004) Plant Cell, 16, pp. 3174-3180; Finnegan, E.J., Dennis, E.S., Isolation and identification by sequence homology of a putative cytosine methyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (1993) Nucleic Acids Res, 21, pp. 2383-2388; Finnegan, E.J., Kovac, K.A., Plant DNA Methyltransferases (2000) Plant Mol Biol, 43, pp. 189-201; Finnegan, E.J., Peacock, W.J., Dennis, E.S., Reduced DNA methylation in Arabidopsis results in abnormal plant development (1996) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 93, pp. 8449-8454; Fox, L.M., Microscopy 101.

Methods: This one year, randomised controlled intervention trial evaluated the effects of a wide forearm support surface and a trackball on upper body pain severity and incident musculoskeletal disorders among 182 call centre operators at a large healthcare company. Participants were randomised to receive (1) ergonomics training only, (2) training plus a trackball, (3) training plus a forearm support, or (4) training plus a trackball and forearm support. Outcome measures were weekly pain severity scores and diagnosis of incident musculoskeletal disorder in the upper extremities or the neck/shoulder region based on physical examination performed by a physician blinded to intervention. Analyses using Cox proportional hazard models and linear regression models adjusted for demographic factors, baseline pain levels, and psychosocial job factors. Results: Post-intervention, 63 participants were diagnosed with one or more incident musculoskeletal disorders. Hazard rate ratios showed a protective effect of the armboard for neck/shoulder disorders (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.97) after adjusting for baseline pain levels and demographic and psychosocial factors. The armboard also significantly reduced neck/shoulder pain (p = 0.01) and right upper extremity pain (p = 0.002) in comparison to the control group. A return-on-investment model predicted a full return of armboard and installation costs within 10.6 months. Conclusion: Providing a large forearm support combined with ergonomic training is an effective intervention to prevent upper body musculoskeletal disorders and reduce upper body pain associated with computer work among call centre employees.",,"adult; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; demography; disease severity; ergonomics; female; health care; human; incidence; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease; neck pain; operator; outcome assessment; pain assessment; physical examination; priority journal; proportional hazards model; protective equipment; randomized controlled trial; shoulder pain; social psychology; training; workplace; Adult; Computer Peripherals; Computer Terminals; Female; Forearm; Human Engineering; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Neck Pain; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Pain; Protective Devices; Shoulder Pain",,,,,,"Norman, K., Nilsson, T., Hagberg, M., Working conditions and health among female and male employees at a call center in Sweden (2004) Am J Ind Med, 46, pp. 55-62; Hales, T.R., Sauter, S.L., Peterson, M.R., Musculoskeletal disorders among visual display terminal users in a telecommunications company (1994) Ergonomics, 37, pp. 1603-1621; Palmer, K.T., Cooper, C., Walker-Bone, K., Use of keyboards and symptoms in the neck and arm: Evidence from a national survey (2001) Occup Med, 51, pp. 392-395; Gerr, F., Marcus, M., Ensor, C., A prospective study of computer users: I.

The plant genome also has 5-methylcytosine at CpG dinucleotides, which is maintained by METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), a homolog of Dnmt1. In addition, plants have DNA methylation at CpNpG and CpNpN sites, maintained, in part, by the CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) DNA methyltransferase. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana embryos with loss-of-function mutations in MET1 and CMT3 develop improperly, display altered planes and numbers of cell division, and have reduced viability. Genes that specify embryo cell identity are misexpressed, and auxin hormone gradients are not properly formed in abnormal met1 embryos. Thus, DNA methylation is critical for the regulation of plant embryogenesis and for seed viability. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"DNA; Enzymes; Hormones; Plants (botany); Seed; Arabidopsis embroyogenesis; Arabidopsis thaliana embryos; CpG dinucleotides; Embryo cells; Genetic engineering; Arabidopsis protein; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase; MET1 protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; article; cell division; cell survival; cytology; DNA methylation; metabolism; physiology; plant seed; pollen; prenatal development; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Division; Cell Survival; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase; DNA Methylation; Pollen; Seeds; Enzymes; Genetic Engineering; Methylation; Nucleic Acids; Plants; Seeds; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Mammalia",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.37; MET1 protein, Arabidopsis, EC 2.1.1.-",,,,"Adams, S., Vinkenoog, R., Spielman, M., Dickinson, H.G., Scott, R.J., Parent-of-origin effects on seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana require DNA methylation (2000) Development, 127, pp. 2493-2502; Bartee, L., Malagnac, F., Bender, J., Arabidopsis cmt3 chromomethylase mutations block non-CG methylation and silencing of an endogenous gene (2001) Genes Dev., 15, pp. 1753-1758; Bender, J., DNA methylation and epigenetics (2004) Annu.

Here, we demonstrate that LEC2 directly controls a transcriptional program involved in the maturation phase of seed development. Induction of LEC2 activity in seedlings causes rapid accumulation of RNAs normally present primarily during the maturation phase. Several RNAs encode proteins with known roles in maturation processes, including seed-storage and lipid-body proteins. Clustering analyses identified other LEC2-induced RNAs not previously shown to be involved in the maturation phase. We show further that genes encoding these maturation RNAs all possess in their 5′ flanking regions RY motifs, DNA elements bound by other closely related B3 domain transcription factors. Our finding that recombinant LEC2 specifically binds RY motifs from the 5′ flanking regions of LEC2-induced genes provides strong evidence that these genes represent transcriptional targets of LEC2. Although these LEC2-induced RNAs accumulate primarily during the maturation phase, we show that a subset, including AGL15 and IAA30, accumulate in seeds containing zygotes. We discuss how identification of LEC2 target genes provides a potential link between the roles of LEC2 in the maturation phase and in the induction of somatic embryogenesis. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Arabidopsis; B3 domain","beta glucuronidase; lipid; luciferase; plant DNA; plant RNA; protein LEC2; transcription factor; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis; article; biolistic transformation; controlled study; DNA flanking region; DNA microarray; DNA sequence; embryo; gel mobility shift assay; gene control; gene identification; nonhuman; plant development; priority journal; protein domain; protein motif; rapeseed; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; seed development; seedling; somatic embryogenesis; transcription regulation; zygote; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA, Plant; Seedling; Transcription Factors; Arabidopsis; Sinapis arvensis",,"beta glucuronidase, 9001-45-0; lipid, 66455-18-3; Arabidopsis Proteins; LEC2 protein, Arabidopsis; RNA, Plant; Transcription Factors",,,,"Berleth, T., Chatfield, S., (2002) The Arabidopsis Book, , www.aspb.org/publications/arabidopsis, eds.

The maternal allele is expressed and the paternal allele is silent. MEA is controlled by DEMETER (DME), a DNA glycosylase required to activate MEA expression, and METHYLTRANSFERASE I (MET1), which maintains CG methylation at the MEA locus. Here we show that DME is responsible for endosperm maternal-allele-specific hypomethylation at the MEA gene. DME can excise 5-methylcytosine in vitro and when expressed in E. coli. Abasic sites opposite 5-methylcytosine inhibit DME activity and might prevent DME from generating double-stranded DNA breaks. Unexpectedly, paternal-allele silencing is not controlled by DNA methylation. Rather, Polycomb group proteins that are expressed from the maternal genome, including MEA, control paternal MEA silencing. Thus, DME establishes MEA imprinting by removing 5-methylcytosine to activate the maternal allele. MEA imprinting is subsequently maintained in the endosperm by maternal MEA silencing the paternal allele. ©2006 Elsevier Inc.",,"5 methylcytosine; dimethyl ether; DNA glycosyltransferase; double stranded DNA; protein mea; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; article; endosperm; Escherichia coli; gene control; gene silencing; genome imprinting; in vitro study; methylation; priority journal; Alleles; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Pair Mismatch; Base Sequence; DNA Methylation; DNA, Plant; Escherichia coli; Gene Silencing; Genes, Plant; Genomic Imprinting; Models, Genetic; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases; Recombinant Proteins; Trans-Activators; Arabidopsis; Escherichia coli",,"5 methylcytosine, 554-01-8; dimethyl ether, 115-10-6; DNA glycosyltransferase, 70356-40-0; Arabidopsis Proteins; DEMETER protein, Arabidopsis, EC 3.2.2.-; DNA, Plant; MEA protein, Arabidopsis; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases, EC 3.2.2.-; Recombinant Proteins; Trans-Activators",,,,"Bastow, R., Mylne, J.S., Lister, C., Lippman, Z., Martienssen, R.A., Dean, C., Vernalization requires epigenetic silencing of FLC by histone methylation (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 164-167; Bender, J., DNA methylation and epigenetics (2004) Annu.

Thus, TAN functions both in the early and late phases of embryo development. Moreover, the TAN and LEC genes interact synergistically suggesting that they do not act in series in the same genetic pathway but, rather, that they have overlapping roles during embryo genesis, tan mutants die as embryos, but immature mutant seeds can be germinated in culture. However, tan mutant seedlings are defective in shoot and root development, their hypocotyls fail to elongate in the dark, and they die as seedlings. We isolated the TAN gene and showed that the predicted polypeptide has seven WD repeat motifs, suggesting that TAN forms complexes with other proteins. Together, these results suggest that TAN interacts with other proteins to control many aspects of embryo development. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Diseases; Mutagenesis; Seed; Arabidopsis; Embryo development; Hypocotyls; Proteins; Diseases; Proteins; Seeds; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis protein; TAN protein, Arabidopsis; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; chemistry; embryo development; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; histology; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; phenotype; plant seed; prenatal development; protein motif; seedling; sequence homology; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Embryonic Development; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phenotype; Seedling; Seeds; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid","GENBANK: AA713092, AB191306, AK118989, AL050352, AB191306","Arabidopsis Proteins; TAN protein, Arabidopsis",,,,"Aida, M., Ishida, T., Fukaki, H., Fujikawa, H., Tasaka, M., Genes involved in organ separation in Arabidopsis; an analysis of the cup-shaped cotyledon mutant (1997) Plant Cell, 9, pp. 841-857; Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 796-815; Barton, M.K., Poethig, R.S., Formation of the shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis thaliana; an analysis of development in the wild type and in the shoot meristemless mutant (1993) Development, 119, pp. 823-831; Baumlein, H., Misera, S., Luerben, H., Kalle, K., Horstmann, C., Wobus, U., Muller, A.J., The FUS3 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana is a regulator of gene expression during late embryogenesis (1994) Plant J, 6, pp. 379-387; Bechtold, N., Ellis, J., Pelletier, G., In planta Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer by infiltration of adult Arabidopsis thaliana plants (1993) CR Acad Sci Paris, 316, pp. 1194-1199; Berleth, T., Chatfield, S., Embryogenesis: Pattern formation from a single cell (2002) The Arabidopsis Book, , http://www.aspb.org/publications/arabidopsis/, CR Somerville, FM Meyerowitz, eds, Rockville, MD; Bewley, J.D., Seed germination and dormancy (1997) Plant Cell, 9, pp. 1055-1066; Brocard-Gifford, I.M., Lynch, T.J., Finkelstein, R.R., Regulatory networks in seeds integrating developmental, abscisic acid, sugar, and light signaling (2003) Plant Physiol, 131, pp. 78-92; Castle, L.A., Meinke, D.W., A FUSCA gene of Arabidopsis encodes a novel protein essential for plant development (1994) Plant Cell, 6, pp. 25-41; Chory, J., Chatterjee, M., Cook, R.K., Elich, T., Fankhauser, C., Li, J., Nagpal, P., Foule, D., From seed germination to flowering, light controls plant development via the pigment phytochrome (1996) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 93, pp. 12066-12071; Dietrich, R.A., Maslyar, D.J., Heupel, R.C., Harada, J.J., Spatial patterns of gene expression in Brassica napus seedlings; identification of a cortex-specific gene and localization of messenger RNA encoding isocitrate lyase and a polypeptide homologous to proteinases (1989) Plant Cell, 1, pp. 73-80; Dilaurenzio, L., Wysockadiller, J., Malamy, J.E., Pysh, L., Helariutta, Y., Freshour, G., Hahn, M.G., Benfey, P.N., The SCARECROW gene regulates an asymmetric cell division that is essential for generating the radial organization of the Arabidopsis root (1996) Cell, 86, pp. 423-433; Feldmann, K.A., Marks, M.D., Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of germinating seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana: A non-tissue culture approach (1987) Mol Gen Genet, 208, pp. 1-9; Finkelstein, R.R., Lynch, T.J., The Arabidopsis abscisic acid response gene AB15 encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor (2000) Plant Cell, 12, pp. 599-609; Finkelstein, R.R., Wang, M.L., Lynch, T.J., Rao, S., Goodman, H.M., The Arabidopsis abscisic acid response locus ABI4 encodes an APETALA 2 domain protein (1998) Plant Cell, 10, pp. 1043-1054; Giraudat, J., Hauge, B.M., Valon, C., Smalle, J., Parcy, F., Goodman, H.M., Isolation of the Arabidopsis ABI3 gene by positional cloning (1992) Plant Cell, 4, pp. 1251-1261; Gleave, A.P., A versatile binary vector system with a T-DNA organisational structure conducive to efficient integration of cloned DNA into the plant genome (1992) Plant Mol Biol, 20, pp. 1203-1207; Goldberg, R.B., De Paiva, G., Yadegari, R., Plant embryogenesis; zygote to seed (1994) Science, 266, pp. 605-614; Harada, J.J., Seed maturation and control of germination (1997) Advances in Cellular and Molecular Biology of Plants, Vol 4, Cellular and Molecular Biology of Seed Development, 4, pp. 545-592. , BA Larkins, IK Vasi, eds.

Here, we show that loss-of-function ap2 mutations cause an increase in seed mass relative to that of wild-type seeds. Analysis of an allelic series of ap2 mutations showed that increases in seed mass corresponded with the severity of defects in flower structure, indicating that AP2 activity directly influences seed mass. Experiments with male-sterile plants and deflowered wild-type plants showed that reduced fertility of ap2 mutant plants due to abnormal flower structure accounted for only part of the increase in seed mass caused by strong ap2 mutant alleles. Reciprocal cross experiments showed that AP2 acts maternally to control seed mass. The maternal effect of AP2 on seed mass involves the regulation of both embryo cell number and cell size. We show further that ap2 mutations cause changes in the ratio of hexose to sucrose during seed development, opening the possibility that AP2 may control seed mass through its effects on sugar metabolism. Together, these results identify a role for AP2 in controlling seed mass. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","ap2; Arabidopsis; Seed size; Sugar metabolism","hexose; sucrose; sugar; allele; APETALA2 gene; Arabidopsis; article; cell count; cell size; embryo cell; fertility; flower; gene activity; gene control; gene function; gene mutation; homeobox; meristem; mutant; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant cell; plant development; plant genetics; plant metabolism; priority journal; protein family; protein function; seed development; seed husk; seed weight; wild type; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cell Count; Cell Size; Homeodomain Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Plant Proteins; Reproduction; Seeds","GENBANK: U12546","hexose, 93780-23-5; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; APETALA2 protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Homeodomain Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Plant Proteins",,,,"Coomes, D.A., Grubb, P.J., (2003) Trends Ecol.

In tobacco, two groups of cells - the circular cell cluster and the stomium - are required for anther dehiscence and define the position at which pollen is released. The processes responsible for the differentiation of the circular cell cluster and the stomium from cells in specific anther regions are unknown. Nor is it understood what initiates the programmed degeneration of these cell types that ultimately is responsible for pollen release from the anther. We characterized stomium and circular cell cluster differentiation and degeneration using both light and transmission electron microscopy throughout anther development, from the emergence of stamen primordia to anther dehiscence at flower opening. We observed that histological changes within primordium L1 and L2 cells destined to become the stomium and circular cell cluster occur at the same time after the differentiation of surrounding locule regions. Sub-epidermal cells that differentiate into the circular cell cluster divide, enlarge, and generate vacuoles with calcium oxalate crystals prior to any detectable changes in prestomium epidermal cells. Differentiation and division of cells that generate the stomium occur after cell degeneration initiates in the circular cell cluster. Prior to dehiscence, the stomium consists of a small set of cytoplasmically dense cells that are easily distinguished from their larger, highly vacuolate epidermal neighbors. Plasmodesmata connections within and between cells of the stomium and circular cell cluster were observed at different developmental stages, suggesting that these cells communicate with each other. Circular cell cluster and stomium cell death is programmed developmentally and occurs at different times. Degeneration of the circular cell cluster occurs first, contributes to the formation of a bilocular anther, and generates the site of anther wall breakage. The stomium cell death process is complete at flower opening and provides an opening for pollen release from each theca. We used laser capture microdissection and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions to demonstrate that stomium cells can be isolated from developing anthers and studied for the presence of specific mRNAs. Our data suggest that a cascade of unique gene expression events throughout anther development is required for the dehiscence program, and that the differentiation of the stomium and circular cell cluster in the interlocular region of the anther probably involves cell signaling processes. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Anther dehiscence; Circular cell cluster; Laser capture microdissection; Stomium; Tobacco","Nicotiana tabacum",,,,,,"Achard, P., Herr, A., Baulcombe, D.C., Harberd, N.P., Modulation of floral development by a gibberellin-regulated microRNA (2004) Development, 131, pp. 3357-3365; Asano, T., Masumura, T., Kusano, H., Kikuchi, S., Kurita, A., Shimata, H., Kadowaki, K.-I., Construction of a specialized cDNA library from plant cells isolated by laser capture microdissection: Toward comprehensive analysis of the genes expressed in the rice phloem (2002) Plant J, 32, pp. 401-408; Beals, T.P., Goldberg, R.B., A novel cell ablation strategy blocks tobacco anther dehiscence (1997) Plant Cell, 9, pp. 1527-1545; Bonner, L.J., Dickinson, H.G., Anther dehiscence in Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.

An invariant aspartic acid in the active site is involved in catalyzing the excision reaction. Replacement of this critical residue with an asparagine severely reduces catalytic activity but preserves enzyme stability and structure. The Arabidopsis DEMETER (DME) gene encodes a large 1,729-aa polypeptide with a 200-aa DNA glycosylase domain. DME is expressed primarily in the central cell of the female gametophyte. DME activates maternal allele expression of the imprinted MEDEA (MEA) gene in the central cell and is required for seed viability. We mutated the invariant aspartic acid at position 1304 in DME to asparagine (D1304N) to determine whether the catalytic activity of the DNA glycosylase domain is required for DME function in vivo. Transgenes expressing wildtype DME in the central cell rescue seed abortion caused by a mutation in the endogenous DME gene and activate maternal MEA:GFP transcription. However, transgenes expressing the D1304N mutant DME do not rescue seed abortion or activate maternal MEA:GFP transcription. Whereas ectopic expression of the wild-type DME polypeptide in pollen is sufficient to activate ectopic paternal MEA and MEA:GUS expression, equivalent expression of the D1304N mutant DME in pollen failed to do so. These results show that the conserved aspartic acid residue is necessary for DME to function in vivo and suggest that an active DNA glycosylase domain, normally associated with DNA repair, promotes gene transcription that is essential for gene imprinting.",,"aspartic acid; demeter protein; DNA glycosyltransferase; gene product; unclassified drug; allele; Arabidopsis; article; base mispairing; catalysis; dme gene; DNA damage; DNA helix; DNA repair; enzyme active site; enzyme stability; enzyme structure; gametophyte; gene; gene expression regulation; genome imprinting; in vivo study; medea gene; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; transcription regulation; transgene; Arabidopsis Proteins; Aspartic Acid; Base Sequence; DNA Glycosylases; DNA Primers; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases; RNA, Plant; Trans-Activators; Transcription, Genetic; Transgenes; Arabidopsis",,"aspartic acid, 56-84-8, 6899-03-2; DNA glycosyltransferase, 70356-40-0; Arabidopsis Proteins; Aspartic Acid, 56-84-8; DEMETER protein, Arabidopsis, EC 3.2.2.-; DNA Glycosylases, EC 3.2.2.-; DNA Primers; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases, EC 3.2.2.-; RNA, Plant; Trans-Activators",,,,"Scharer, O.D., Jiricny, J., (2001) BioEssays, 23, pp. 270-281; Krokan, H.E., Standal, R., Slupphaug, G., (1997) Biochem.

DME DNA glycosylase activates maternal MEA allele expression in the central cell of the female gametophyte, the progenitor of the endosperm. Maternal mutant dme or mea alleles result in seed abortion. We identified mutations that suppress dme seed abortion and found that they reside in the MET1 methyltransferase gene, which maintains cytosine methylation. Seeds with maternal dme and met1 alleles survive, indicating that suppression occurs in the female gametophyte. Suppression requires a maternal wild-type MEA allele, suggesting that MET1 functions upstream of, or at, MEA. DME activates whereas MET1 suppresses maternal MEA::GFP allele expression in the central cell. MET1 is required for DNA methylation of three regions in the MEA promoter in seeds. Our data suggest that imprinting is controlled in the female gametophyte by antagonism between the two DNA-modifying enzymes, MET1 methyltransferase and DME DNA glycosylase.",,"Arabidopsis protein; cytosine; DNA glycosyltransferase; methyltransferase; allele; Arabidopsis; article; competitive inhibition; controlled study; DNA methylation; DNA modification; endosperm; enzyme activity; gametophyte; gene expression; genome imprinting; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant seed; priority journal; promoter region; stem cell; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; Cytosine; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase; DNA Methylation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genomic Imprinting; Molecular Sequence Data; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Seeds; Suppression, Genetic; Trans-Activators; Arabidopsis; Spermatophyta","GENBANK: AF139372, NP_001370, P05102, P13864","cytosine, 71-30-7; DNA glycosyltransferase, 70356-40-0; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cytosine, 71-30-7; DEMETER protein, Arabidopsis, EC 3.2.2.-; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.37; MEA protein, Arabidopsis; MET1 protein, Arabidopsis, EC 2.1.1.-; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases, EC 3.2.2.-; Trans-Activators",,,,"Adams, S., Vinkenoog, R., Spielman, M., Dickinson, H.G., Scott, R.J., Parent-of-origin effects on seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana require DNA methylation (2000) Development, 127, pp. 2493-2502; Bowman, J.L., Flowers: Introduction (1994) Arabidopsis: an Atlas of Morphology and Development, pp. 135-145. , J.

Although the familial form is autosomal dominant, many cases are also sporadic. The mutations causing this disorder were found in a winged/forkhead transcription factor gene named FOXL2. We have sequenced the mouse homolog for the FOXL2 gene and identified the Fugu rubripes (pufferfish) ortholog from the database. By alignment of the three sequences, we found an almost complete conservation of the forkhead domain in the three species. There is 95% and 61% conservation at the protein level between human-mouse and human-pufferfish, respectively. The polyalanine and polyproline tracts within the gene are absent in Fugu rubripes. An overview identifies four breaks in the conservation of the gene within these species. Using a direct sequencing approach, we performed mutation analysis from DNA of nine affected individuals from familial and sporadic cases. The mutations are distributed throughout the coding region of the FOXL2 gene. We identified five novel mutations: g.292delG (E19fsX149); g.530G>A (W98X); g.548A>G (H104R); g.652G>T (E139X); and g.1178_1185del8 (A314fsX530). In addition we also identified two known mutations g.823C>T (Q196X) and g.1092_1108dup17, the latter in individuals from three unrelated pedigrees. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome;

We previously showed that LEC1 encodes an HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT binding factor and that the 10 Arabidopsis HAP3 (AHAP3) subunits can be divided into two classes, the LEC1-type and the non-LEC1-type, based on sequence similarity within their B domains. By analyzing the ability of chimeric HAP3 subunits containing different combinations of domains from LEC1 and a non-LEC1-type AHAP3 subunit to suppress genetically the lec1 mutation, we show that the B domain of LEC1 is necessary and sufficient within the context of the protein for its activity in embryogenesis. Moreover, we identify one amino acid residue, Asp-55, specific to the LEC1-type B domain that is required for LEC1 activity in embryogenesis and sufficient to confer partial LEC1 activity to a non-LEC1-type B domain. Based on structural similarities between the HAP3 B domain and histone fold motif, we discuss how the Asp-55 residue may functionally differentiate LEC1 from the non-LEC1-type AHAP3 subunits.",,"CCAAT binding factor; CCAAT enhancer binding protein; chimeric protein; histone; leafy cotyledon 1 protein; protein; protein ahap3; protein hap3; unclassified drug; alpha helix; amino acid analysis; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; Arabidopsis; article; cotyledon; DNA binding; embryo development; gene; gene mutation; lec1 gene; nonhuman; open reading frame; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; protein folding; protein structure; seedling; sequence analysis; site directed mutagenesis; transgene; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; DNA Primers; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Transcription Factors; Arabidopsis",,"histone, 9062-68-4; protein, 67254-75-5; Arabidopsis Proteins; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; DNA Primers; LEC1 protein, Arabidopsis; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,"Laux, T., Jurgens, G., (1997) Plant Cell, 9, pp. 989-1000; Goldberg, R.B., De Paiva, G., Yadegari, R., (1994) Science, 266, pp. 605-614; West, M.A.L., Harada, J.J., (1993) Plant Cell, 5, pp. 1361-1369; Jurgens, G., (2001) EMBO J., 20, pp. 3609-3616; Harada, J.J., (1997) Cellular and Molecular Biology of Seed Development, Advances in Cellular and Molecular Biology of Plants, 4, pp. 545-592. , eds.

However, suppression of L1L gene expression induced defects in embryo development that differed from those of lec1 mutants, suggesting that LEC1 and L1L play unique roles in embryogenesis. We show that L1L expressed under the control of DNA sequences flanking the LEC1 gene suppressed genetically the lec1 mutation, suggesting that the LEC1 -type B domains of L1L and LEC1 are critical for their function in embryogenesis. Our results also suggest that LEC1-type HAP3 subunits arose from a common origin uniquely in plants. Thus, L1L, an essential regulator of embryo development, defines a unique class of plant HAP3 subunits.",,"DNA; Genes; Mutagenesis; Embryogenesis; Plants (botany); Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Regulator; In Situ Hybridization; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Mutation; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; RNA, Plant; Seeds; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Transcription Factors; Arabidopsis","GENBANK: AF533650, AY138461","Arabidopsis Proteins; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; HAP proteins, Arabidopsis; HAP3a protein, Arabidopsis; LEC1 protein, Arabidopsis; Plant Proteins; RNA, Plant; Transcription Factors",,,,"Albani, D., Robert, L.S., Cloning and characterization of a Brassica napus gene encoding a homologue of the B subunit of a heteromeric CCAAT-binding factor (1995) Gene, 167, pp. 209-213; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., (1995) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3rd Ed., , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Bechtold, N., Ellis, J., Pelletier, G., In planta Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer by infiltration of adult Arabidopsis thaliana plants (1993) C.

Previously, five major genes (designated Gy1 to Gy5) encoding glycinin subunits have been described. In this report two new genes are identified and mapped: a glycinin pseudogene, gy6, and a functional gene, Gy7. Messenger RNA for the gy6 pseudogene is not detected in developing seeds. While Gy7 mRNA was present at the midmaturation stage of seed development in the soybean variety Resnik, the steady state amount of this message was at least an order of magnitude less-prevalent than the mRNA encoding each of the other five glycinin subunits. Even though the amino-acid sequence of the glycinin subunit G7 is related to the other five soybean 11S subunits, it does not fit into either the Group-1 (G1, G2, G3) or the Group-2 (G4, G5) glycinin subunit families. The Gy7 gene is tandemly linked 3′ to Gy3 on Linkage Group L (chromosome 19) of the public molecular linkage map. By contrast, the gy6 gene occupies a locus downstream from Gy2 on Linkage Group N (chromosome 3) in a region that is related to the position where Gy7 is located on chromosome 19.","Glycinin; Plant genes; Soybean; Storage proteins","Food storage; Genes; Proteins; RNA; Seed; Signal encoding; Genomic organizations; Crops; Embryophyta; Glycine max",,,,,,"Akkaya, M.S., Shoemaker, R.C., Specht, J.E., Bhagwat, A.A., Cregan, P.B., Integration of simple sequence repeat DNA markers into a soybean linkage map (1995) Crop Sci, 35, pp. 1439-1445; Allona, I., Casado, R., Aragoncillo, C., Seed storage proteins from Pinus pinaster Ait: Homology of major components with 11S proteins from angiosperms (1992) Plant Sci, 87, pp. 9-18; Arahira, M., Fukazawa, C., Ginkgo 11S seed storage protein family mRNA: Unusual Asn-Asn linkage as a post-translational cleavage site (1994) Plant Mol Biol, 25, pp. 597-605; Bäumlein, H., Wobus, U., Pustell, J., Kafatos, F.C., The legumin gene family: Structure of a B-type gene of Vicia faba and a possible legumin gene-specific regulatory element (1986) Nucleic Acids Res, 14, pp. 2707-2720; Bäumlein, H., Nagy, I., Villarroel, R., Inze, D., Wobus, U., Cis-analysis of a seed protein gene promoter: The conservative RY repeat CATGCATG within the legumin box is essential for tissue-specific expression of a legumin gene (1992) Plant J, 2, pp. 233-239; Chen, Z., Shoemaker, R.C., Four genes affecting seed traits in soybean map to linkage group F (1998) J Hered, 89, pp. 211-215; Cho, T.J., Nielsen, N.C., Glycinin Gy3 gene from the soybean variety Dare (1989) Nucleic Acids Res, 17, p. 4388; Cho, T.J., Davies, C.S., Nielsen, N.C., Inheritance and organization of glycinin genes in soybean (1989) Plant Cell, 1, pp. 329-337; Cregan, P.B., Kollipara, K.P., Xu, S.J., Singh, R.J., Fogarty, S.E., Hymowitz, T., Primary trisomics and SSR markers as tools to associate chromosomes with linkage groups in soy beans (2001) Crop Sci, 41, pp. 1262-1267; Dickinson, C.D., Evans, R.P., Nielsen, N.C., RY-repeats are conserved in the 5′-flanking regions of legume seed-protein genes (1988) Nucleic Acids Res, 16, p. 371; Diers, B.W., Beilinson, V., Nielsen, N.C., Shoemaker, R.C., Genetic mapping of the Gy4 and Gy5 glycinin genes in soybean and analysis of a variant of Gy4 (1993) Theor Appl Genet, 89, pp. 297-304; Dunwell, J.M., Khuri, S., Gane, P.J., Microbial relatives of the seed storage proteins of higher plants: Conservation of structure and diversification of function during evolution of the cupin superfamily (2000) Microbiol Mol Biol Rev, 64, pp. 153-179; Garner, M.E., Hymowitz, T., Xu, S.J., Hartman, G.L., Physical map location of the Rps1-k allele in soybean (2001) Crop Sci, , in press; Häger, K.-P., Fischer, H., Molecular phylogenies and structural diversification of gymnosperm and angiosperm storage globulins (1999) Seed Proteins, pp. 499-516. , Shewry P, Casey R (eds).

DME is required for maternal allele expression of the imprinted MEDEA (MEA) Polycomb gene in the central cell and endosperm. Ectopic DME expression in endosperm activates expression of the normally silenced paternal MEA allele. In leaf, ectopic DME expression induces MEA and nicks the MEA promoter.

We identified two mRNAs, designated G564 and C541, that accumulate specifically within the suspensor of globular-stage embryos. G564 mRNA accumulates uniformly throughout the suspensor, whereas C541 mRNA accumulates to a higher level within the large basal cells of the suspensor that anchor the embryo to the surrounding seed tissue. Both G564 and C541 mRNAs begin to accumulate shortly after fertilization and are present within the two basal cells of embryos at the four-cell stage. In contrast, at the same stage, these mRNAs are not detectable within the two descendants of the apical cell. Nor are they detectable within cells of the embryo sac before fertilization, including the egg cell. We used a G564/β-glucuronidase reporter gene to show that the G564 promoter is activated specifically within the basal region and suspensor of preglobular tobacco embryos. Analysis of the G564 promoter identified a sequence domain required for transcription within the suspensor that contains several copies of a conserved motif. These results show that derivatives of the apical and basal cells transcribe different genes as early as the four-cell stage of embryo development and suggest that the apical and basal cells are specified at the molecular level after division of the zygote.",,"Genes; Plant cell culture; Embryos; RNA; Base Sequence; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Library; Genes, Reporter; In Situ Hybridization; Molecular Sequence Data; Phaseolus; Plants, Genetically Modified; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Seeds; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Tobacco; Transcription, Genetic; Transformation, Genetic",,"RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant",,,,"Alpi, A., Lorenzi, R., Cionini, P.G., Bennici, A., D'Amato, F., Identification of gibberellin A1 in the embryo suspensor of Phaseolus coccineus (1979) Planta, 147, pp. 225-228; Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1992) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , New York: Green Publishing and Wiley Interscience; Barker, S.J., Harada, J.J., Goldberg, R.B., Cellular localization of soybean storage protein messenger RNA in transformed tobacco seeds (1988) Proc.

For example, in Arabidopsis, the shoot undergoes a transition and produces reproductive flowers after the adult phase of vegetative growth. Much is known about genetic and environmental processes that control flowering time in mature plants. However, little is understood about the mechanisms that prevent plants from flowering much earlier during embryo and seedling development. Arabidopsis embryonic flower (emf1 and emf2) mutants flower soon after germination, suggesting that a floral repression mechanism is established in wild-type plants that prevents flowering until maturity. Here, we show that polycomb group proteins play a central role in repressing flowering early in the plant life cycle. We found that mutations in the Fertilization Independent Endosperm (FIE) polycomb gene caused the seedling shoot to produce flower-like structures and organs. Flower-like structures were also generated from the hypocotyl and root, organs not associated with reproduction. Expression of floral induction and homeotic genes was derepressed in mutant embryos and seedlings. These results suggest that FIE-mediated polycomb complexes are an essential component of a floral repression mechanism established early during plant development.",,"article; embryo development; fertilization; higher plant; life cycle; nonhuman; plant growth; plant seed; priority journal; reproduction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Artificial Gene Fusion; Caulimovirus; Gene Expression; Genes, Plant; Genetic Vectors; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Luminescent Proteins; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Repressor Proteins; Seeds; Time Factors; Transgenes; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; FIE protein, Arabidopsis; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Luminescent Proteins; Plant Proteins; polycomb protein, plant; Repressor Proteins",,,,"Walbot, V., (1985) Trends Genet., 1, pp. 165-169; Goldberg, R.B., De Paiva, G., Yadegari, R., (1994) Science, 266, pp. 605-614; Haughn, G.W., Schultz, E.A., Martinez-Zapater, J.M., (1995) Can.

LEC2 is required for the maintenance of suspensor morphology, specification of cotyledon identity, progression through the maturation phase, and suppression of premature germination. We cloned the LEC2 gene on the basis of its chromosomal position and showed that the predicted polypeptide contains a B3 domain, a DNA-binding motif unique to plants that is characteristic of several transcription factors. We showed that LEC2 RNA accumulates primarily during seed development, consistent with our finding that LEC2 shares greatest similarity with the B3 domain transcription factors that act primarily in developing seeds, VIVIPAROUS1/ABA INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3. Ectopic, postembryonic expression of LEC2 in transgenic plants induces the formation of somatic embryos and other organ-like structures and often confers embryonic characteristics to seedlings. Together, these results suggest that LEC2 is a transcriptional regulator that establishes a cellular environment sufficient to initiate embryo development.",,"DNA binding protein; gene product; protein leafy cotyledon2; RNA; transcription factor; transcription factor aba insensitive3; transcription factor fusca3; transcription factor vivaparous1; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis; article; chromosome; controlled study; embryo development; germination; maturation; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant growth; plant seed; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; transcription regulation; transgenic plant; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cotyledon; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; GTP-Binding Proteins; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Proteins; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Seeds; Sequence Alignment; Transcription Factors","GENBANK: AC021044, AF400123, AF400124, AL080330","Arabidopsis Proteins; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Fungal Proteins; FUS3 protein, S cerevisiae; FUS6 protein, Arabidopsis; GPS1 protein, human; GTP-Binding Proteins, EC 3.6.1.-; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; LEC1 protein, Arabidopsis; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Plant Proteins; Proteins; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,"Olsen, O.A., (2001) Annu.

Young Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90095, United States","We identified a T-DNA-generated mutation in the chaperonin-60α gene of Arabidopsis that produces a defect in embryo development. The mutation, termed schlepperless (slp), causes retardation of embryo development before the heart stage, even though embryo morphology remains normal. Beyond the heart stage, the slp mutation results in defective embryos with highly reduced cotyledons, slp embryos exhibit a normal apical-basal pattern and radial tissue organization, but they are morphologically retarded. Even though slp embryos are competent to transcribe two late-maturation gene markers, this competence is acquired more slowly as compared with wild-type embryos, slp embryos also exhibit a defect in plastid development-they remain white during maturation in planta and in culture. Hence, the overall developmental phenotype of the slp mutant reflects a lesion in the chloroplast that affects embryo development. The slp phenotype highlights the importance of the chaperonin-60α protein for chloroplast development and subsequently for the proper development of the plant embryo and seedling.",,"chaperonin; DNA transfer; gene mutation; genetic marker; maturation promoting factor; phenotype; plant morphology; plant; somatic embryogenesis; wild relative; DNA; Genes; Mutagenesis; Physiology; Tissue; Embryos; Plants (botany); Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Chaperonin 60; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Complementary; Genetic Complementation Test; Germination; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Transformation, Genetic",,"Chaperonin 60; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Complementary; RNA, Messenger; T-DNA",,,,"Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1992) Current Protocol in Molecular Biology, , Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York; Behringer, F.J., Medford, J.I., A plasmid rescue technique for the recovery of plant DNA disrupted by T-DNA insertion (1992) Plant Mol Biol Rep, 10, pp. 190-198; Berleth, T., Jürgens, G., The role of monopteros in organizing the basal body region of the Arabidopsis embryo (1993) Development, 118, pp. 575-587; Castle, L.A., Errampalli, D., Aterton, T.L., Franzmann, L.H., Yoon, E.S., Meinke, D.W., Genetic and molecular characterization of embryonic mutants identified following seed transformation in Arabidopsis (1993) Mol Gen Genet, 241, pp. 504-514; Clark, J.K., Sheridan, W.F., Isolation and characterization of 51 embryo-specific mutations in maize (1991) Plant Cell, 3, pp. 935-951; Cloney, L.P., Bekkaoui, D.R., Feist, G.I., Lane, W.S., Hemmingsen, S.M., Brassica napus plastid and mitochondrial chaperonin-60 protein contain multiple distinct polypeptides (1994) Plant Physiol, 105, pp. 233-241; Cole, K.P., Blakeley, S.D., Dennis, D.T., Isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding Brassica napus plastid chaperonin-60α subunit (1994) Plant Physiol, 105, p. 453; Cox, K.H., Goldberg, R.B., Analysis of plant gene expression (1988) Plant Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach, pp. 1-34. , CH Shaw, ed.

Egg and sperm nuclei fuse to form the embryo. A second sperm nucleus fuses with the central cell nucleus, which replicates to generate the endosperm, a tissue that supports embryo development. The FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MEDEA (MEA) genes encode WD and SET domain polycomb proteins, respectively. In the absence of fertilization, a female gametophyte with a loss-of-function fie or mea allele initiates endosperm development without fertilization, fie and mea mutations also cause parent-of-origin effects, in which the wild-type maternal allele is essential and the paternal allele is dispensable for seed viability. Here, we show that FIE and MEA polycomb proteins interact physically, suggesting that the molecular partnership of WD and SET domain polycomb proteins has been conserved during the evolution of flowering plants. The overlapping expression patterns of FIE and MEA are consistent with their suppression of gene transcription and endosperm development in the central cell as well as their control of seed development after fertilization. Although FIE and MEA interact, differences in maternal versus paternal patterns of expression, as well as the effect of a recessive mutation in the DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1) gene on mutant allele transmission, indicate that fie and mea mutations cause parent-of-origin effects on seed development by distinct mechanisms.",,"polycomb protein, plant; primer DNA; repressor protein; Arabidopsis; article; gene; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; nucleotide sequence; plant seed; prenatal development; two hybrid system; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; Genes, Plant; Mutation; Repressor Proteins; Seeds; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; Arabidopsis; Magnoliophyta",,"DNA Primers; polycomb protein, plant; Repressor Proteins",,,,"Berger, F., Endosperm development (1999) Curr.

The delayed dehiscence1 defect is caused by a delay in the stomium degeneration program. The gene disrupted in delayed dehiscence1 encodes 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, an enzyme in the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway. We rescued the mutant phenotype by exogenous application of jasmonic acid and obtained seed set from previously male-sterile plants. In situ hybridization studies showed that during the early stages of floral development, DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulated within all floral organs. Later, DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulated specifically within the pistil, petals, and stamen filaments. DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA was not detected in the stomium and septum cells of the anther that are involved in pollen release. The T-DNA insertion in delayed dehiscence1 eliminated both DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulation and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase activity. These experiments suggest that jasmonic acid signaling plays a role in controlling the time of anther dehiscence within the flower.",,"12 oxophytodienoate reductase; anther; biochemical pathway; biosynthesis; delayed dehiscence1 gene; flowering; gene disruption; gene insertion; in situ hybridization; jasmonic acid; male sterility; messenger RNA; mutant; signal transduction; tissue specificity; transfer deoxyribonucleic acid; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Cyclopentanes; DNA, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Oxidoreductases; Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors; Phenotype; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta",,"12-oxophytodienoate reductase, EC 1.3.1.42; Cyclopentanes; DNA, Bacterial; jasmonic acid, 6894-38-8; Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors, EC 1.3.-; Oxidoreductases, EC 1.-; RNA, Messenger; T-DNA",,,,"Altmann, T., Recent advances in brassinosteroid molecular genetics (1998) Curr.

Egg and sperm nuclei fuse to form the embryo. A second sperm nucleus fuses with the central cell nucleus that replicates to generate the endosperm, which is a tissue that supports embryo development. MEDEA (MEA) encodes an Arabidopsis SET domain Polycomb protein. Inheritance of a maternal loss-of-function mea allele results in embryo abortion and prolonged endosperm production, irrespective of the genotype of the paternal allele. Thus, only the maternal wild-type MEA allele is required for proper embryo and endosperm development. To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the parent-of-origin effects of mea mutations on seed development, we compared the expression of maternal and paternal MEA alleles in the progeny of crosses between two Arabidopsis ecotypes. Only the maternal MEA mRNA was detected in the endosperm from seeds at the torpedo stage and later. By contrast, expression of both maternal and paternal MEA alleles was observed in the embryo from seeds at the torpedo stage and later, in seedling, leaf, stem, and root. Thus, MEA is an imprinted gene that displays parent-of-origin-dependent monoallelic expression specifically in the endosperm. These results suggest that the embryo abortion observed in mutant mea seeds is due, at least in part, to a defect in endosperm function. Silencing of the paternal MEA allele in the endosperm and the phenotype of mutant mea seeds supports the parental conflict theory for the evolution of imprinting in plants and mammals.",,"Arabidopsis protein; MEA protein, Arabidopsis; messenger RNA; primer DNA; vegetable protein; allele; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome imprinting; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; plant seed; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genomic Imprinting; Plant Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Seeds",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; DNA Primers; MEA protein, Arabidopsis; Plant Proteins; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Berger, F., Endosperm development (1999) Curr.

Egg and sperm nuclei fuse to form the embryo. A second sperm nucleus fuses with the central cell nucleus that replicates to generate the endosperm, a tissue that supports embryo development. To understand mechanisms that initiate reproduction, we isolated a mutation in Arabidopsis, f644, that allows for replication of the central cell and subsequent endosperm development without fertilization. When mutant f644 egg and central cells are fertilized by wild-type sperm, embryo development is inhibited, and endosperm is overproduced. By using a map-based strategy, we cloned and sequenced the F644 gene and showed that it encodes a SET-domain polycomb protein. Subsequently, we found that F644 is identical to MEDEA (MEA), a gene whose maternal-derived allele is required for embryogenesis [Grossniklaus, U., Vielle-Calzada, J.-P., Hoeppner, M. A. and Gagliano, W. B. (1998) Science 280, 446-450]. Together, these results reveal functions for plant polycomb proteins in the suppression of central cell proliferation and endosperm development.

Higher plant reproduction is unique because two fertilization events are required for sexual reproduction. First, a sperm must fuse with the egg to form an embryo. A second sperm must then fuse with the adjacent central cell nucleus that replicates to form an endosperm, which is the support tissue required for embryo and/or seedling development. Here, we report cloning of the Arabidopsis FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) gene. The FIE protein is a homolog of the WD motif-containing Polycomb proteins from Drosophila and mammals. These proteins function as repressers of homeotic genes. A female gametophyte with a loss-of-function allele of fie undergoes replication of the central cell nucleus and initiates endosperm development without fertilization. These results suggest that the FIE Polycomb protein functions to suppress a critical aspect of early plant reproduction, namely, endosperm development, until fertilization occurs.",,"fertilization; mutation; plant development; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Division; Cloning, Molecular; Fertilization; Genetic Complementation Test; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phenotype; Plant Proteins; Repressor Proteins","GENBANK: AF129516","Arabidopsis Proteins; FIE protein, Arabidopsis; Plant Proteins; Repressor Proteins",,,,"Bell, C., Ecker, J.R., Assignment of 30 microsatellite loci to the linkage map of Arabidopsis (1994) Genomics, 19, pp. 137-144; Brown, J.W.S., Arabidopsis intron mutations and pre-mRNA splicing (1996) Plant J., 10, pp. 771-780; Century, K.S., Shapiro, A.D., Repetti, P.P., Dahlbeck, D., Holub, E., Staskawicz, J.B., NDR1, a pathogen-induced component required for Arabidopsis disease resistance (1997) Science, 278, pp. 1963-1965; Chaudhury, A.M., Ming, L., Miller, C., Craig, S., Dennis, E.S., Peacock, W.J., Fertilization-independent seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana (1997) Proc.

Biol., University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1606, United States","We identified Arabidopsis thaliana sterility mutants by screening T-DNA and EMS-mutagenized lines and characterized several male-sterile mutants with defects specific for different anther processes. Approximately 44 and 855 sterile mutants were uncovered from the T-DNA and EMS screens, respectively. Several mutants were studied in detail with defects that included the establishment of anther morphology, microspore production, pollen differentiation, and anther dehiscence. Both non-dehiscencing and late-dehiscencing mutants were identified. In addition, pollenless mutants were observed with either apparent meiotic defects and/or abnormalities in cell layers surrounding the locules. Two mutant alleles were identified for the POLLENLESS3 locus which have defects in functional microspore production that lead to the degeneration of cells within the anther locules. pollenless3-1 contains a T-DNA insertion that co-segregates with the mutant phenotype and pollenless3-2 has a large deletion in the POLLENLESS3 gene. The POLLENLESS3 gene has no known counterparts in the GenBank, but encodes a protein containing putative nuclear localization and protein-protein interaction motifs. The POLLENLESS3 gene was shown recently to be the same as MS5, a previously described Arabidopsis thaliana male-sterility mutant. Three genes were identified in the POLLENLESS3 genomic region: GENEY, POLLENLESS3, and β9-TUBULIN. The segment of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome containing the POLLENLESS3 and β9-TUBULIN genes is duplicated and present on a different chromosome. Analysis of the POLLENLESS3 expression pattern determined that the 1.3-kb POLLENLESS3 mRNA is localized specifically within meiotic cells in the anther locules and that POLLENLESS3 mRNA is present only during late meiosis.","Anther development; Arabidopsis; Gene duplication; Male-sterility mutants; Meiosis; T-DNA and EMS mutagenesis","allele; deletion mutagenesis; developmental genetics; gene sequencing; meiosis; messenger RNA; mutant; plant development; plant genetics; plant genome; Arabidopsis thaliana","GENBANK: AB011475, AF031608, AF060248, H77068, M21415, M84706",,,,,"Aarts, M.G.M., Dirkse, W.G., Stiekema, W.J., Pereira, A., Transposon tagging of a male sterility gene in Arabidopsis (1993) Nature, 363, pp. 715-717; Aarts, M.G.M., Keijzer, C.J., Stiekema, W.J., Pereira, A., Molecular characterization of the CER1 gene of Arabidopsis involved in epicuticular wax biosynthesis and pollen fertility (1995) Plant Cell, 7, pp. 2115-2127; Albertsen, M.C., Phillips, R.L., Developmental cytology of 13 genetic male sterile loci in maize (1981) Can J Genet Cytol, 23, pp. 195-208; Alexandrov, N.N., Nussinov, R., Zimmer, R.M., Fast protein fold recognition via sequence to structure alignment and contact capacity potentials (1995) Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 1996, pp. 53-72. , Hunter L, Klein TE (eds).

We isolated the LEC1 gene and showed that it functions at an early developmental stage to maintain embryonic cell fate. The LEC1 gene encodes a transcription factor homolog, the CCAAT box-binding facto HAP3 subunit. LEC1 RNA accumulates only during seed development in embryo cell types and in endosperm tissue. Ectopic postembryonic expression of the LEC1 gene in vegetative cells induces the expression of embryo-specific genes and initiates formation of embryo-like structures. Our results suggest that LEC1 is an important regulator of embryo development that activates the transcription of genes required for both embryo morphogenesis and cellular differentiation.",,"arabidopsis; article; cell differentiation; developmental genetics; embryo development; gene expression; gene isolation; genetic transcription; morphogenesis; nonhuman; plant seed; priority journal; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; chemistry; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; mutation; physiology; plant seed; prenatal development; restriction mapping; sequence homology; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis protein; CCAAT enhancer binding protein; DNA binding protein; LEC1 protein, Arabidopsis; messenger RNA; plant RNA; transcription factor; vegetable protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Restriction Mapping; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Seeds; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Transcription Factors","GENBANK: AF036684","Arabidopsis Proteins; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; LEC1 protein, Arabidopsis; Plant Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Transcription Factors",,,,"Albani, D., Robert, L.S., Cloning and characterization of a Brassica napus gene encoding a homologue of the B subunit of a heteromeric CCAAT-binding factor (1995) Gene, 167, pp. 209-213; Baumlein, H., Misera, S., Luerben, H., Kolle, K., Horstmann, C., Wobus, U., Muller, A.J., The FUS3 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana is a regulator of gene expression during late embryogenesis (1994) Plant J., 6, pp. 379-387; Bechtold, N., Ellis, J., Pelletier, G., In planta Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer by infiltration of adult Arabidopsis thaliana plants (1993) C.R.

To test this hypothesis, we introduced the soybean lectin gene Le1 either behind its own promoter or behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter into Lotus corniculatus, which is nodulated by R. loti. We found that nodulelike outgrowths developed on transgenic L. corniculatus plant roots in response to Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which nodulates soybean and not Lotus spp. Soybean lectin was properly targeted to L. corniculatus root hairs, an.d although infection threads formed, they aborted in epidermal or hypodermal cells. Mutation of the lectin sugar binding site abolished infection thread formation and nodulation. Incubation of bradyrhizobia in the nodulation (nod) gene-inducing flavonoid genistein increased the number of nodulelike outgrowths on transgenic L. corniculatus roots. Studies of bacterial mutants, however, suggest that a component of the exopolysaccharide surface of B. japonicum, rather than Nod factor, is required for extension of host range to the transgenic L. corniculatus plants.",,"Lotus corniculatus; Rhizobium",,,,,,"Beringer, J.E., R-factor transfer in Rhizobium leguminosarum (1974) J.

Cell division orientation was randomised, with each embryo exhibiting a different pattern. Periclinal divisions did not occur after the eight-cell embryo proper stage and fist embryos lacked a histologically distinct protoderm layer. Terminal embryos resembled globular-stage embryos, but were a disorganised mass containing 30-100 cells. Some terminal embryos (5%) developed xylem-like elements in outer surface cells, indicating that the fist mutation affects radial pattern. A soybean β-conglycinin seed storage protein gene promoter, active in wild-type embryos from heart stage to maturity, was also active in terminal fist embryos despite their disorganised globular state. This indicated that some pathways of cellular differentiation in fist embryos proceed independently of both organised division plane orientation and normal morphogenesis. Endosperm morphogenesis in seeds containing terminal fist embryos was arrested at one of three distinct developmental stages and appeared unlinked to fist embryo morphogenesis. The β-conglycinin seed storage protein gene promoter, normally active in cellularised wild-type endosperm, was inactive in fist endosperm, indicating abnormal development of fist endosperm at the biochemical level. These data indicate that the fist mutation, either directly or indirectly, results in defects in cell division orientation during the early stages of Arabidopsis embryo development. Other aspects of the fist phenotype, such as defects in endosperm development and radial pattern formation, may be related to abnormal cell division orientation or may occur as pleiotropic effects of the fist mutation.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Cell division; Embryo mutants; Endosperm; T-DNA","Arabidopsis",,,,,,"Berleth, T., Jürgens, G., The role of the monopteros gene in organising the basal body region of the Arabidopsis embryo (1993) Development, 118, pp. 575-587; Bowman, J.L., Embryogenesis (1993) Arabidopsis: An Atlas of Morphology and Development, pp. 351-401. , Bowman JL (ed) Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York; Castle, L.A., Errampalli, D., Atherton, T.L., Franzmann, L.H., Yoon, E.S., Meinke, D.W., Genetic and molecular characterisation of embryonic mutants identified following seed transformation in Arabidopsis (1993) Mol Gen Genet, 241, pp. 504-514; Christensen, C.A., King, E.J., Jordan, J.R., Drews, G.N., Megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis wild type and the Gf mutant (1997) Sex Plant Reprod, 10, pp. 49-64; Cyr, R.J., Microtubules in plant morphogenesis: Role of the cortical array (1994) Annu Rev Cell Biol, 10, pp. 153-180; Dupree, P., Plant embryogenesis: Cell division forms a pattern (1996) Curr Biol, 6, pp. 683-685; Errampalli, D., Patton, D., Castle, L., Mickelson, L., Hansen, K., Schnall, J., Feldmann, K., Meinke, D., Embryonic lethals and T-DNA insertional mutagenesis in Arabidopsis (1991) Plant Cell, 3, pp. 149-157; Esau, K., (1977) Anatomy of Seed Plants, 2nd Edn., , Wiley, New York; Feldmann, K.A., T-DNA insertion mutagenesis in Arabidopsis: Mutational spectrum (1991) Plant J, 1, pp. 71-82; Feldmann, K.A., Marks, M.D., Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of germinating seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana: A non-tissue culture approach (1987) Mol Gen Genet, 208, pp. 1-9; Francis, D., Halford, N.G., The plant cell cycle (1995) Physiol Plant, 93, pp. 365-374; Goldberg, R.B., De Paiva, G., Yadegari, R., Plant embryogenesis: Zygote to seed (1994) Science, 266, pp. 605-614; Goldstein, B., Cell contacts orient some cell division axes in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo (1995) J Cell Biol, 129, pp. 1071-1080; Gunning, B.E.S., Wick, S.M., Preprophase bands, phragmoplasts and spatial control of cytokinesis (1985) J Cell Sci [Suppl], 2, pp. 157-179; Hirai, M.Y., Fujiwara, T., Goto, K., Komeda, Y., Chino, M., Naito, S., Differential regulation of soybean seed-storage proteingene promoter-GUS fusions by exogenously applied methionine in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (1994) Plant Cell Physiol, 35, pp. 927-934; Jefferson, R., Assaying chimeric genes in plants: The GUS gene fusion system (1987) Plant Mol Biol Rep, 5, pp. 387-405; Johansen, D.A., (1950) Plant Embryology, , Chronica Botanica, Waltham; Jürgens, G., Mayer, U., Arabidopsis (1994) Embryos: Color Atlas of Development, pp. 7-21. , Bard JBL (ed) Wolfe, London; Konieczny, A., Ausubel, F.M., A procedure for mapping Arabidopsis mutations using co-dominant ecotype-specific PCR-based markers (1993) Plant J, 4, pp. 403-410; Kropf, D.L., Cytoskeletal control of cell polarity in a plant zygote (1994) Dev Biol, 165, pp. 361-371; Lukowitz, W., Mayer, U., Jürgens, G., Cytokinesis in the Arabidopsis embryo involves the syntaxin-related KNOLLE gene product (1996) Cell, 84, pp. 61-71; Lyndon, R.F., The mechanism of leaf initiation (1983) The Growth and Functioning of Leaves, pp. 3-24. , Dale JE, Milthorpe FL (eds) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Mansfield, S.G., Briarty, L.G., Development of the free-nuclear endosperm in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

The tobacco TA56 gene promoter is active within the circular cell cluster, stomium, and connective regions of the anther at different developmental stages. We introduced a cytotoxic TA56/barnase gene into tobacco plants together with three different anticytotoxic barstar genes. The anticytotoxic barstar genes were used to protect subsets of anther cell types from the cytotoxic effects of the TA56/barnase gene. The chimeric barstar genes were fused with (1) the tobacco TP12 gene promoter that is active at high levels in most anther cell types; (2) the soybean lectin gene promoter that is active earlier in the connective, and at lower levels in the circular cell cluster and stomium, than is the TA56 promoter; and (3) the tobacco TA20 gene promoter that is active at high levels in most anther cell types but has a different developmental profile than does the TP12 promoter. Normal anther development and dehiscence occurred in plants containing the TA56/barnase and TP12/barstar genes, indicating that barstar protects diverse anther cell types from the cytotoxic effects of barnase. Anthers containing the TA56/barnase and lectin/barstar genes also developed normally but failed to dehisce because of extensive ablation of the circular cell cluster, stomium, and contiguous connective regions. Anthers containing the TA56/barnase and TA20/barstar genes failed to dehisce as well. However, only the stomium region was ablated in these anthers. The connective, circular cell cluster, and adjacent wall regions were protected from ablation by the formation of barnase/barstar complexes. We conclude that anther dehiscence at flower opening depends on the presence of a functional stomium region and that chimeric barnase and barstar genes containing promoters that are active in several overlapping cell types can be used for targeted cell ablation experiments.",,"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease; bacterial protein; barstar protein, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; messenger RNA; ribonuclease; article; cytology; genetic transcription; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; promoter region; tobacco; Bacterial Proteins; Plants, Toxic; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Ribonucleases; RNA, Messenger; Tobacco; Transcription, Genetic",,"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease, EC 3.1.4.-; Bacterial Proteins; barstar protein, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, 37328-61-3; Ribonucleases, EC 3.1.-; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Bellen, H.J., D'Evelyn, D., Harvey, M., Elledge, S.J., Isolation of temperature-sensitive diphtheria toxins in yeast and their effects on Drosophila cells (1992) Development, 114, pp. 787-796; Bernstein, A., Breitman, M., Genetic ablation in transgenic mice (1989) Mol.

Two alternative, but not mutually exclusive, mechanisms probably play a major role in plant-cell differentiation. One mechanism utilizes a position-independent, cell-autonomous differentiation process. The other, employs a position-dependent, cell-cell interaction process that requires signals from neighbouring cells. Cell ablation studies can be used to distinguish between these two models of plant-cell differentiation. In this article we outline a new cell-ablation strategy that utilizes promoters with distinct, but overlapping, cell specificities that are fused with cytotoxic and anticytotoxic structural genes.

Mutant cotyledons possess trichomes that are normally a leaf trait in Arabidopsis, and the cellular organization of these organs is intermediate between that of cotyledons and leaves from wild-type plants. We present several lines of evidence that indicate that the control of late embryogenesis is compromised by the mutation. First, mutant embryos are desiccation intolerant, yet embryos can be rescued before they dry to yield homozygous recessive plants that produce defective embryos exclusively. Second, although many genes normally expressed during embryonic development are active in the mutant, at least one maturation phase-specific gene is not activated. Third, the shoot apical meristem is activated precociously in mutant embryos. Fourth, in mutant embryos, several genes characteristic of postgerminative development are expressed at levels typical of wild-type seedlings rather than embryos. We conclude that postgerminative development is initiated prematurely and that embryonic and postgerminative programs operate simultaneously in mutant embryos. The pleiotropic effects of the mutation indicate that the LECI gene plays a fundamental role in regulating late embryogenesis. The role of LEC1 and its relationship to other genes involved in controlling late embryonic development are discussed.",,,,,,,,,"Harada, J.J.; Section of Plant Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States",,,,,,,,10404651,,PLCEE,,"English","Plant Cell",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028313437

Embryogenesis in these mutants is indistinguishable from that of wild-type plants until the late-globular stage, after which raspberry 1 and raspberry 2 embryos fail to undergo the transition to heart stage, remain globular shaped, and proliferate an enlarged suspensor region, raspberry 1 and raspberry 2 embryo-proper regions enlarge during embryogenesis, become highly vacuolate, and display prominent convex, or ""raspberry-like,"" protuberances on their outer cell layers. In situ hybridization studies with several embryo cell-specific mRNA probes indicated that the raspberry1 and raspberry2 embryo-proper regions differentiate tissue layers in their correct spatial contexts and that the regulation of cell-specific genes within these layers is normal. Surprisingly, a similar spatial and temporal pattern of mRNA accumulation occurs within the enlarged suspensor region of raspberry1 and raspberry2 embryos, suggesting that a defect in embryo-proper morphogenesis can cause the suspensor to take on an embryo-proper-like state and differentiate a radial tissue-type axis.

We constructed a stigma-specific cytotoxic gene by fusing the STIGI gene 5' regulatory region with the coding sequence of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens barnase gene, to assess the role of the stigmatic secretory zone in the pollination process. Pistils of transgenic STIG1-barnase tobacco plants undergo normal development, but lack the stigmatic secretory zone and are female sterile. Pollen grains germinate on the ablated 'stigmatic' surface, but are unable to penetrate the transmitting tissue of the style. Application of stigmatic exudate from wild-type pistils to the ablated surface increases the efficiency of pollen tube germination and growth and restores the capacity of pollen tubes to penetrate the style. Our data demonstrate the importance of the stigmatic secretory zone in the pollination process and provide an approach to identify compounds produced by the stigma that are critical for successful pollination and fertilization to occur.","Cell ablation; Female sterility; Pistil exudate; Secretory zone; Stigma","article; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; bacterial gene; chimera; cytotoxicity; female sterility; fertilization; gene fusion; germination; nonhuman; plant cell; pollen; priority journal; regulator gene; tobacco; transcription regulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Chimeric Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; DNA; Fertility; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Structural, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Plants, Toxic; Reproduction; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tobacco; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Bacteria (microorganisms); Nicotiana obtusifolia; Nicotiana tabacum","GENBANK: X77823","Chimeric Proteins; DNA, 9007-49-2; Plant Proteins; RNA, Messenger; STIG1 protein, Nicotiana tabacum",,,,,"Mariani, C.; Department of Experimental Botany, Catholic University of Nijmegen, Toernoiveld 1, 6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",,,,,,,,02614189,,EMJOD,8039494,"English","EMBO J.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028272419

Two petal mRNA classes were identified that are present at elevated levels relative to other organs. One class is represented equally in the unpigmented tube and pigmented limb regions of the corolla. The other class accumulates preferentially within the limb region. Limb-specific mRNAs accumulate at different times during corolla development, peak in prevalence prior to flower opening, and are localized in either the epidermal cell layers or the mesophyll. The epidermal- and mesophyll-specific mRNAs change abruptly in concentration within a narrow zone of the limb/tube border. Preferential accumulation of at least one limb-specific mRNA occurs within the corolla upper region early in development prior to limb maturation and pigment accumulation. Limb-specific mRNAs also accumulate preferentially within the unpigmented corolla limb region of Nicotiana sylvestris, a diploid progenitor of tobacco. Runoff transcription studies and experiments with chimeric β-glucuronidase genes showed that petal gene organ, cell, and region specificities are controlled primarily at the transcriptional level.

To determine whether the Tgm1 element or a secondary mutation was responsible for repressing le1 gene transcription, we eliminated the insertion element by constructing a chimeric lectin gene (le1/le1) that contained the 5′ half of the le1 gene and its promoter region and the 3′ half of the wild-type Le1 gene. Transformed tobacco seed containing the le1/le1 gene produced both lectin mRNA and protein, demonstrating that the mutant lectin gene control region is transcriptionally competent.

A tapetal-specific gene, designated as TA29, was isolated from a tobacco genome library.

Destruction of the tapetum by the cytotoxic gene had no effect on the differentiation and/or function of surrounding sporophytic tissues but led to the production of male-sterile plants.

The five genes have diverged into two subfamilies that are designated as Group-I and Group-II glycinin genes. Each glycinin gene contains four exons and three introns like genes that encode related proteins in other legumes. Two other genes have been identified and designated as ""glycinin-related"" because they hybridize weakly with the five glycinin genes. Although not yet characterized, glycinin-related genes could encode other glycinin subunit families whose members accumulate in minor amounts in seeds. The three Group-I glycinin genes are organized into two chromosomal domains, each about 45 kilobase pairs in length. The two domains have a high degree of homology, and contain at least five genes each that are expressed either in embryos or in mature plant leaves. Gel blot studies with embryo mRNA, as well as transcription studies with 32P-RNA synthesized in vitro from purified embryo nuclei, indicate that glycinin and glycinin-related genes become transcriptionally activated in a coordinated fashion early in embryogenesis, and are repressed coordinately late in seed development.

These genes encode prevalent mRNAs that accumulate and decay during embryogenesis, and are either undetectable or present at low levels in mature plant organ systems. Transcriptional activation and repression processes are important in regulating seed protein developmental expression programs. We started DNA binding protein studies with the soybean lectin gene to begin to identify trans-acting proteins and cis-regulatory sequences required for seed protein gene expression. We have identified an embryo DNA binding protein that interacts with specific sequences in the lectin gene 5' region. The DNA binding protein is undetectable in mature plant organ systems and its concentration parallels the lectin gene transcription rate during embryogenesis. The DNA binding protein activity corresponds to a 60,000 M(r) (60K) nuclear protein, and a protein of similar size interacts with at least one other seed protein but not with a gene inactive during embryogenesis. Our data suggest that the 60K protein, and the DNA sequences that it interacts with, may be involved in regulating lectin gene expression.",,"dna binding protein; gene control; gene expression; genetic engineering; heredity; nonhuman; priority journal; Base Sequence; DNA-Binding Proteins; Lectins; Molecular Weight; Nucleoproteins; Peptide Mapping; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,"DNA-Binding Proteins; Lectins; Nucleoproteins; RNA, Messenger; soybean lectin",,,,,,,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,3614381,"English","NATURE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023191505

We observed that 65% of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis single-copy DNA fragments reacted with each other using moderately stringent hybridization conditions (60° C, 0.18 M Na+). An additional 10% sequence homology was detected when the hybridization temperature was reduced by 10° C. The thermal stability of interspecific single-copy DNA duplexes indicated that they were approximately 6% more mispaired than homologous single-copy DNA duplexes. In contrast, we observed almost no single-copy DNA divergence between N. tabacum and its diploid progenitors. Greater than 99% of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis single-copy DNAs reacted with N. tabacum DNA using moderately stringent hybridization conditions. The thermal stability of these duplexes indicated that they contained no more sequence mismatch than homologous single-copy duplexes. Together, our results show that significant single-copy DNA sequence divergence has occurred between the diploid N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis genomes.

We conclude that this insertion results in reduced transcription of the mutant L1 gene, and leads to the lectinless phenotype. © 1983.",,"DNA; lectin; RNA; article; gene expression regulation; genetics; mutation; phenotype; plant seed; soybean; transposon; DNA; DNA Transposable Elements; Gene Expression Regulation; Lectins; Mutation; Phenotype; RNA; Seeds; Soybeans; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; RNA, 63231-63-0; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, 9007-49-2; Lectins; RNA, 63231-63-0",,,,"Alwine, Kemp, Parker, Stark, Wahl, Detection of specific RNAs or specific fragments of DNA by fractionation in gels and transfer to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper (1979) Methods Enzymol., 68, pp. 220-242; Benton, Davis, Screening λgt recombinant clones by hybridization to single plaques in situ (1977) Science, 196, pp. 180-182; Bingham, Judd, A copy of the copia transposable element is very tightly linked to the wa allele at the white locus of D. melanogaster (1981) Cell, 25, pp. 705-711; Burr, Burr, Ds controlling elements of maize at the shrunken locus are large and dissimilar insertions (1982) Cell, 29, pp. 977-986; Cameron, Loh, Davis, Evidence for transposition of dispersed repetitive DNA families in yeast (1979) Cell, 16, pp. 739-751; Calos, Miller, Transposable elements (1980) Cell, 20, pp. 579-595; Collins, Rubin, Structure of the Drosophila mutable allele, white-crimson, and its white-ivory and wild-type derivatives (1982) Cell, 30, pp. 71-79; Fincham, Sastry, Controlling elements in maize (1974) Ann.

Primary cultures of rat adrenal gland were dissociated with trypsin and separated by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity. After two days in culture, cells showed a reproducible sedimentation profile consisting of two classes of cells with mean sedimentation rates of 5.8 and 2.1 mm/h, and a third sedimentation peak consisting mainly of nuclei at 0.5mm/h. All populations continued to incorporate 3H-thymidine in relatively constant proportion throughout the culture period, but the relative number of cells in the 2.1 mm/h peak increased two-fold in the last few days of primary culture. Cells labelled in primary culture, but separated after an additional 5 days in secondary culture had lost proportionately more labelled cells from the 5.8 mm peak.

One family directs the synthesis of the major storage protein glycinin; the other encodes a 15.5 kd poly-peptide of unknown function. DNA blot hybridization experiments showed approximately three, non-allelic genes in the glycinin family and two in the 15 kd protein family, and showed that these families are not selectively amplified or rearranged during embryogeny. R-loop and S1 nuclease mapping studies demonstrated no detectable introns in the 15 kd protein genes but at least one and possibly two in the glycinin genes. No interfamily clustering of these genes occurs within a 10-15 kb chromosomal domain. Nor are they contiguous to other genes expressed at moderate levels during embryogenesis. Each of them, however, is contiguous to a gene expressed at another developmental period in the leaf. These leaf genes encode rare class messages which constitute only 1 × 10-5% of the leaf mRNA, or about one molecule per cell. R-loop analysis of two leaf genes showed that one contains no detectable introns while the other possesses at least three. DNA gel blot studies showed that only one of the seed protein genomic clones contains an interspersed repetitive DNA element. Pairwise cross-hybridization studies did not detect any flanking sequences shared by the 15 kd protein, glycinin and leaf genes. © 1982.",,"DNA; endonuclease; globulin; glycinin; messenger RNA; nuclease S1; vegetable protein; article; genetics; metabolism; nucleic acid hybridization; nucleotide repeat; nucleotide sequence; plant seed; soybean; structural gene; Aspergillus Nuclease S1; Base Sequence; DNA; Endonucleases; Genes, Structural; Globulins; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Soybeans; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Vegetable Proteins",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; endonuclease, 9055-11-2; glycinin, 9007-93-6; nuclease S1, 37288-25-8; Aspergillus Nuclease S1, EC 3.1.30.1; DNA, 9007-49-2; Endonucleases, EC 3.1.-; Globulins; glycinin, 9007-93-6; RNA, Messenger; Vegetable Proteins",,,,"Alwine, Kemp, Parker, Reisner, Stark, Wahl, Detection of specific RNAs or specific fragments of DNA by fractionation in gels and transfer to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper (1979) Meth.

A cDNA library of mid-maturation-stage mRNA sequences was constructed by cloning into pBR322. Plasmids representing distinct superabundant mRNA species (>10,000 molecules per cell) were selected from the library, and four clones were chosen for further investigation. Hybridization experiments with mRNA blots showed that three of the clones hybridized to a single mRNA, each of which had a unique size. One clone, however, was complementary to two mRNAs having distinct molecular weights. The prevalence of each mRNA was quantitated at distinct developmental periods. The results showed that the mRNAs accumulated during early embryogeny and then decayed prior to seed dehydration. In addition, the cloned transcripts were either undetectable, or present at very low levels (<1 molecule per 20 cells) in leaf cells, suggesting that their structural genes are regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. The reiteration frequency of genes encoding all four mRNAs was measured by hybridizing labeled, single-stranded plasmid DNA probes with an excess of embryo and/or leaf DNAs. The findings demonstrated that each message is encoded by a small multigene family containing {slanted equal to or less-than}5 members. No detectable differences in hybridization rates were observed with leaf and embryo DNAs, indicating an absence of selective gene amplification during embryogenesis. © 1981.",,"messenger RNA; polyadenylic acid; recombinant DNA; restriction endonuclease; article; embryology; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular cloning; nucleic acid hybridization; nucleotide sequence; plant seed; plasmid; soybean; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA Restriction Enzymes; DNA, Recombinant; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Plasmids; Poly A; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Soybeans; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,"polyadenylic acid, 24937-83-5; DNA Restriction Enzymes, EC 3.1.21; DNA, Recombinant; Plasmids; Poly A, 24937-83-5; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Affara, Robert, Jaquet, Buckingham, Gros, Changes in gene expression during myogenic differentiation.

RNA-excess hybridization experiments with cDNA and single-copy DNA showed that cotyledon-stage (30 days after flowering (DAF)) and mid-maturation-stage (75 DAF) embryos contained similar numbers of diverse mRNAs (14,000-18,000) but that their mRNA frequency distributions were vastly different. Hybridization experiments with kinetically selected mid-maturation-stage abundant and rare cDNAs demonstrated that the diverse mRNAs of cotyledon-stage and mid-maturation-stage embryos were similar, and that most embryonic mRNAs persist throughout development and are stored in the dormant seed. We have, however, identified a small number (7-10) of superabundant mRNAs which collectively comprise about 50% of the mid-maturation-stage mRNA mass. These mRNAs are quantitatively modulated in development, are embryo specific, and are encoded by low-frequency repetitive DNA sequences. This developmentally regulated mRNA set probably codes for a spectrum of seed proteins which accumulate during maturation. © 1981.",,"DNA; messenger RNA; polyadenylic acid; agar gel electrophoresis; article; embryology; gene expression regulation; growth, development and aging; kinetics; metabolism; nucleic acid hybridization; nucleotide sequence; plant seed; polysome; soybean; Base Sequence; DNA; Electrophoresis, Agar Gel; Gene Expression Regulation; Kinetics; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Poly A; Polyribosomes; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Soybeans; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; polyadenylic acid, 24937-83-5; DNA, 9007-49-2; Poly A, 24937-83-5; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Auger, Baulcombe, Verma, Sequence complexities of the poly(A)-containing mRNA in uninfected soybean root and the nodule tissue developed due to infection by Rhizobium (1979) Biochim.

Cellular reactions to visual and acoustic stimuli unrelated to the behavioral tasks were also investigated. Several types of reactions were observed in relation to the behavioral events of delayed response. Some of the reactions were found to be related to the spatial position (right or left) of the cue. Others were dependent on task-specific conditions of cue presentation and on the interposition of a temporal discontinuity (delay) between cue and response. The activity of some cells seemed to change in relation to emotional or arousing properties of test stimuli. In the context of lesion studies, present results are indicative of the participation of prefrontal neurons in attentive and mnemonic processes that mediate performance of spatial delay tasks.

Using a sensitive RNA-excess/single-copy DNA hybridization strategy (Galau et al., 1976), our studies reveal that 3.0-3.4 × 107 nucleotides of single-copy transcript, or 24,000-27,000 average-sized mRNAs, are present in the polysomes of each organ system (leaf, root, stem, petal, anther and ovary). These mRNA sets are transcribed individually from 4.7-5.2% of the single-copy DNA. Approximately 1 × 107 nucleotides of single-copy transcript, or 8000 diverse mRNAs, were shown to be shared by the polysomes of all organs. The sequence composition of the remaining polysomal mRNAs was found to be highly regulated, each organ having at least 8 × 106 nucleotides of mRNA complexity, or 6000 diverse gene transcripts, which are not present in the polysomes of other organs. Hybridization experiments with nuclear RNA revealed that structural genes not utilized for the production of functional mRNAs in a given were nevertheless transcribed, and were represented by transcripts in the hnRNA. This suggests that post-transcriptional selection mechanisms may play an important role in the regulation of plant gene expression. Collectively, our measurements demonstrate that at least 11% of the single-copy DNA, or 60,000 diverse structural genes, are expressed in the entire plant during the dominant phase of its life cycle. This amount of genetic information constitutes only 4.6% of the tobacco genome. © 1980.",,"messenger rna; animal experiment; gene expression; heredity; higher plant; structural gene; Cell Differentiation; Cell Nucleus; Genes, Structural; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Plants, Toxic; Polyribosomes; Reproduction; RNA, Messenger; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tobacco; Transcription, Genetic",,"RNA, Messenger",,,,"Auger, Baulcombe, Verma, Sequence complexities of the poly(A) mRNA in uninfected soybean root and the nodule tissue developed due to the infection by Rhizobium (1979) Biochim.

This analysis employed the gene 32 proteinethidium bromide spreading technique, a procedure which produces striking contrast between double and single-stranded DNA regions. To investigate the arrangement of repetitive sequences differing in genomic frequency, three kinetic fractions of 5 kb DNA fragments were isolated by reassociation and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Renatured structures in each fraction were then visualized in the electron microscope. The majority of repeated sequences, irrespective of frequency, were shown to be relatively non-divergent, to exceed 1.5 kbp in length (number-average), and to be organized primarily into long regularly repeating tandem or clustered arrays. Duplex regions >5 kbp were commonly visualized. A small fraction of low frequency repeats (<100 copies per genome), however, was observed to have a distinctly different form of arrangement. These repeats averaged 0.2 kbp in length, contained divergent sequences, and were contiguous to single copy DNA sequences having an average length of 1.15 kbp. Repeats which flanked a given single copy sequence did not appear to be homologous. Neither short clustered permuted repeats nor interspersion of repeats which differed significantly in reiteration frequency were found to be major features of soybean genome organization. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",,"dna; animal experiment; heredity; higher plant; nucleotide sequence; psychological aspect",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,"Alberts, B.M., Amadio, F.J., Jenkins, M., Gutman, E.D., Ferris, F.L., Studies with DNA-cellulose chromatography.

Polysomal RNA from tobacco leaves was prepared by a procedure which minimized contamination with nuclear RNA. Hybridization of 3H-cDNA complementary to polysomal poly(A) RNA with an excess of tobacco DNA indicated that &gt;95% of the poly(A) mRNA was transcribed from single-copy sequences. RNA excess hybridization reactions with polysomal poly(A) RNA and 3H-cDNA revealed the presence of three abundance classes in the poly(A) mRNA. The best least-squares solution indicated that these classes comprise 9, 52, and 39% of the poly(A) mRNA and contain sequences present an average of 4500, 340 and 17 times per cell. Hybridization reactions containing an excess of nuclear or total polysomal RNA and 3H-single-copy DNA indicated the complexity of these RNA populations to be 1.19 × 108 nucleotides (nuclear) and 3.33 × 107 nucleotides (polysomal). Thus only 28% of the nuclear RNA sequence diversity (27,000 average-sized mRNA sequences) is represented in leaf polysomes. These results suggest that there is a general similarity in the basic transcriptional processes of metaphytan and metazoan cells. © 1978.",,"dna; rna; animal experiment; higher plant; hybrid; nucleus; polysome; Base Sequence; Cell Nucleus; DNA; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Plants, Toxic; Polyribosomes; RNA; RNA, Messenger; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Tobacco; Transcription, Genetic",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; RNA, 63231-63-0; DNA, 9007-49-2; RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Axel, Feigelson, Schutz, (1976) Cell, 7, pp. 247-254; Bantle, Hahn, (1976) Cell, 8, pp. 139-150; Bishop, Rosbash, Evans, (1974) J.

The reassociation of 300 nucleotide DNA fragments analyzed by hydroxyapatite chromatography reveals the presence of three major classes of DNA differing in reiteration frequency. Each class of DNA was isolated and characterized with respect to kinetic homogeneity and thermal properties on melting. These measurements demonstrate that the genome of N. tabacum has a 1C DNA content of 1.65 pg and that DNA sequences are represented an average of 12,400, 252, and 1 times each. - The organization of the DNA sequences in the N. tabacum genome was determined from the reassociation kinetics of long DNA fragments as well as S1 nuclease resistance and hyperchromicity measurements on DNA fragments after annealing to C0t values at which only repetitive DNA sequences will reassociate. At least 55% of the total DNA sequences are organized in a short period interspersion pattern consisting of an alternation of single copy sequences, averaging 1400 nucleotides, with short repetitive elements approximately 300 nucleotides in length. Another 25% of the genome contains long repetitive DNA sequences having a minimal genomic length of 1500 nucleotides. These repetitive DNA sequences are much less divergent than the short interspersed DNA sequence elements. These results indicate that the pattern of DNA sequence organization in the tobacco genome bears remarkable similarity to that found in the genomes of most animal species investigated to date. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,"dna; nucleotide; genome; in vitro study; nucleotide sequence; plant; theoretical study",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,"Angerer, R.C., Davidson, E.H., Britten, R.J., DNA sequence organization in the mollusc Aplysia californica (1975) Cell, 6, pp. 29-39; Bendich, A.J., McCarthy, B.J., DNA comparisons among barley, oats, rye, and wheat (1970) Genetics, 65, pp. 545-565; Bonner, T.I., Brenner, D.J., Neufeld, B.R., Britten, R.J., Reduction in the rate of DNA reassociation by sequence divergence (1973) J. molec.

Analysis of the nuclear and polysomal poly(A) RNA by sucrose density gradient centrifugation under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions showed that the populations have indistinguishable size distributions. The number average sizes were calculated to be 1150 nucleotides for nuclear and 1140 nucleotides for polysomal poly(A) RNA. Selective inhibition of rRNA synthesis was used to investigate the size distribution of hnRNA without regard to poly(A) content. Very little hnRNA was observed which sedimented more rapidly than polysomal poly(A) RNA. Hybridization experiments in which an excess of nuclear DNA was reacted with H-poly(A) hnRNA or 3H-poly(A) mRNA showed that both populations contain repetitive transcripts (9-10%) as well as single-copy transcripts (44%). Analysis of hybrids on hydroxyapatite in the presence of 8 M urea demonstrated that the poly(A) RNA complementary to repetitive DNA sequence components represented a population of molecules distinct from the population complementary to single-copy DNA. The complexity of whole cell, nuclear and polysomal RNA was determined by saturation hybridization to single-copy 3H-DNA. All three populations were complementary to essentially the same fraction of the DNA. Terminal hybridization values were 3.84, 3.76 and 3.76% for whole cell, nuclear and polysomal RNA, respectively, representing a complexity of 2.1 × 106 nucleotides. These data suggest that the composition of the hnRNA and mRNA populations are essentially identical. No evidence for selective turnover of any sequence component or size class within the nucleus was observed. © 1977.",,"messenger rna; radioisotope; ribosome rna; rna; cell nucleus; dna rna hybridization; fungus; in vitro study; methodology; microorganism; polysome; theoretical study; Base Sequence; Cell Nucleus; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; DNA; Mitosporic Fungi; Nucleic Acid Denaturation; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Nucleotides; Poly A; Polyribosomes; RNA; RNA, Ribosomal; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Water Microbiology",,"RNA, 63231-63-0; DNA, 9007-49-2; Nucleotides; Poly A, 24937-83-5; RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, Ribosomal",,,,"Bantle, Hahn, (1976) Cell, 8, pp. 139-150; Barksdale, (1969) Science, 166, pp. 831-837; Brandhorst, Humphreys, (1972) J.

Except for the jellyfish these animals belong to the protostomial branch of animal evolution, for which little information regarding DNA sequence organization has previously been available. The reassociation kinetics of short (250-300 nucleotide) and long (2,000-3,000 nucleotide) DNA fragments was studied by the hydroxyapatite method. It was shown that in each case a major fraction of the DNA consists of single copy sequences less than about 3,000 nucleotides in length, interspersed with short repetitive sequences. The lengths of the repetitive sequences were estimated by optical hyperchromicity and S1 nuclease measurements made on renaturation products.

Approximately 60% of the total mRNA radioactivity of the postnuclear supernatant was recovered and shown to be free of any other labeled RNA species such as ribosomal and nuclear RNA. The mRNA was examined by hybridization to DNA present in great excess. The mRNA hybridizes almost exclusively with nonrepetitive DNA. Almost all of the messenger RNA molecules of sea urchin gastrulae therefore consist of transcripts from nonrepetitive sequences. It appears that the structural genes expressed at this stage are typically not repeated in the genome and the mRNA does not include recognizable repetitive sequence.",,"dna; messenger rna; puromycin; rna; cell hybridization; embryo; in vitro study; invertebrate; phosphate p 32; polysome; theoretical study; uridine h 3",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; puromycin, 53-79-2, 58-58-2; RNA, 63231-63-0",,,,,,,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,,"English","PROC.
