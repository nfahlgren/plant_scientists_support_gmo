This selectivity is enabled by the formation of lignin-based Casparian strips. Casparian strip formation is initiated by the localization of the Casparian strip domain proteins (CASPs) in the plasma membrane, at the site where the Casparian strip will form. Localized CASPs recruit Peroxidase 64 (PER64), a Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog F, and Enhanced Suberin 1 (ESB1), a dirigent-like protein, to assemble the lignin polymerization machinery. However, the factors that control both expression of the genes encoding this biosynthetic machinery and its localization to the Casparian strip formation site remain unknown. Here, we identify the transcription factor, MYB36, essential for Casparian strip formation. MYB36 directly and positively regulates the expression of the Casparian strip genes CASP1, PER64, and ESB1. Casparian strips are absent in plants lacking a functional MYB36 and are replaced by ectopic lignin-like material in the corners of endodermal cells. The barrier function of Casparian strips in these plants is also disrupted. Significantly, ectopic expression of MYB36 in the cortex is sufficient to reprogram these cells to start expressing CASP1-GFP, correctly localize the CASP1-GFP protein to form a Casparian strip domain, and deposit a Casparian strip-like structure in the cell wall at this location. These results demonstrate that MYB36 is controlling expression of the machinery required to locally polymerize lignin in a fine band in the cell wall for the formation of the Casparian strip. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

Our time course RNA-Seq experiment uses over 500 million read pairs to provide a detailed characterization of the response to infection in both susceptible and resistant hosts. The set of observed differentially expressed genes is consistent with previous studies, confirming and extending existing findings about genes likely to play an important role in the defense response to Pseudomonas syringae. The high coverage of the Arabidopsis transcriptome resulted in the discovery of a surprisingly large number of alternative splicing (AS) events - more than 44% of multi-exon genes showed evidence for novel AS in at least one of the probed conditions. This demonstrates that the Arabidopsis transcriptome annotation is still highly incomplete, and that AS events are more abundant than expected. To further refine our predictions, we identified genes with statistically significant changes in the ratios of alternative isoforms between treatments. This set includes several genes previously known to be alternatively spliced or expressed during the defense response, and it may serve as a pool of candidate genes for regulated alternative splicing with possible biological relevance for the defense response against invasive pathogens. © 2013 Howard et al.",,"messenger RNA; transcriptome; alternative RNA splicing; Arabidopsis thaliana; article; controlled study; exon; gene expression; genetic association; high throughput sequencing; host pathogen interaction; host resistance; innate immunity; intron; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant leaflet; protein localization; Pseudomonas infection; Pseudomonas syringae; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; tomato; Alternative Splicing; Arabidopsis; Exons; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Introns; Pseudomonas syringae; RNA Splice Sites; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription, Genetic",,,,,"2T32ES007329-10, NIEHS, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; NIH, National Institutes of Health; IOS-0951512, NSF, National Science Foundation","Quirino, B.F., Bent, A.F., Deciphering host resistance and pathogen virulence: the Arabidopsis/Pseudomonas interaction as a model (2003) Molecular plant pathology, 4, pp. 517-530. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20569411, Available:.

This observation establishes low leaf K + as a new phenotype for loss-of-function alleles of CPR5. We investigate the factors affecting this low leaf K + in cpr5 using double mutants defective in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signalling, and by gene expression analysis of various channels and transporters. Reciprocal grafting between cpr5 and Col-0 was used to determine the relative importance of the shoot and root in causing the low leaf K + phenotype of cpr5. Our data show that loss-of-function of CPR5 in shoots primarily determines the low leaf K + phenotype of cpr5, though the roots also contribute to a lesser degree. The low leaf K + phenotype of cpr5 is independent of the elevated SA and JA known to occur in cpr5. In cpr5 expression of genes encoding various Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channels (CNGCs) are uniquely elevated in leaves. Further, expression of HAK5, encoding the high affinity K + uptake transporter, is reduced in roots of cpr5 grown with high or low K + supply. We suggest a model in which low leaf K + in cpr5 is driven primarily by enhanced shoot-to-root K + export caused by a constitutive activation of the expression of various CNGCs. This activation may enhance K + efflux, either indirectly via enhanced cytosolic Ca 2+ and/or directly by increased K + transport activity. Enhanced shoot-to-root K + export may also cause the reduced expression of HAK5 observed in roots of cpr5, leading to a reduction in uptake of K +.

However, unbiased discovery and validation of biomolecular signatures from these experiments remains a challenge. Here we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) leaf ionome, or elemental composition, contains such signatures, and we establish statistical models that connect these multivariable signatures to defined physiological responses, such as iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) homeostasis. Iron is essential for plant growth and development, but potentially toxic at elevated levels. Because of this, shoot Fe concentrations are tightly regulated and show little variation over a range of Fe concentrations in the environment, making them a poor probe of a plant's Fe status. By evaluating the shoot ionome in plants grown under different Fe nutritional conditions, we have established a multivariable ionomic signature for the Fe response status of Arabidopsis. This signature has been validated against known Fe-response proteins and allows the high-throughput detection of the Fe status of plants with a false negative/positive rate of 18%/16%. A ""metascreen"" of previously collected ionomic data from 880 Arabidopsis mutants and natural accessions for this Fe response signature successfully identified the known Fe mutants frd1 and frd3. A similar approach has also been taken to identify and use a shoot ionomic signature associated with P homeostasis. This study establishes that multivariable ionomic signatures of physiological states associated with mineral nutrient homeostasis do exist in Arabidopsis and are in principle robust enough to detect specific physiological responses to environmental or genetic perturbations. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Arabidopsis; Biomarker; Ionomics; Multivariable signature","cadmium; cobalt; iron; manganese; molybdenum; phosphorus; Arabidopsis; article; controlled study; homeostasis; leaf morphology; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; plant physiology; priority journal; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Metals, Heavy; Phosphates; Plant Leaves; Plant Physiology; Plant Shoots; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; cobalt, 7440-48-4; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; molybdenum, 7439-98-7; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Arabidopsis Proteins; Metals, Heavy; Phosphates",,,,"Bitarte, N., Bandres, E., Zarate, R., Ramirez, N., Garcia-Foncillas, J., Moving forward in colorectal cancer research, what proteomics has to tell (2007) World J Gastroenterol, 13, pp. 5813-5821; Gerszten, R.E., Wang, T.J., The search for new cardiovascular biomarkers (2008) Nature, 451, pp. 949-952; Ward, M., Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (2007) Exp Rev Mol Diagn, 7, pp. 635-646; Chuang, H.Y., Lee, E., Liu, Y.T., Lee, D., Ideker, T., Network-based classification of breast cancer metastasis (2007) Mol Syst Biol, 3, p. 140; Rifai, N., Gillette, M.A., Carr, S.A., Protein biomarker discovery and validation: The long and uncertain path to clinical utility (2006) Nat Biotechnol, 24, pp. 971-983; Salt, D.E., Baxter, I., Lahner, B., Ionomics and the study of the plant ionome (2008) Annu Rev Plant Biol, 59, pp. 709-733; Kim, S.A., Guerinot, M.L., Mining iron: Iron uptake and transport in plants (2007) FEBS Lett, 581, pp. 2273-2280; Misson, J., A genome-wide transcriptional analysis using Arabidopsis thaliana Affymetrix gene chips determined plant responses to phosphate deprivation (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 11934-11939; Leplatte.F, Murase I, Martell AE (1967)Newmultidentate ligands: Chelating tendencies of N,N′-di(2-hydroxybenzyl ethylenediamine)-N,N′- diacetic acid.
