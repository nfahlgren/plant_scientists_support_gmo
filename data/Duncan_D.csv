A particularly dramatic example is the metamorphosis of insects, in which pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone drive the wholesale transformation of the larva into an adult. The mechanisms responsible for this transformation are not well understood. Work in Drosophila indicates that the larval and adult forms are patterned by the same underlying sets of developmental regulators, but it is not understood how the same regulators pattern two distinct forms. Recent studies indicate that this ability is facilitated by a global change in the responsiveness of target genes during metamorphosis. Here we show that this shift is controlled in part by the ecdysone-induced transcription factor E93. Although long considered a dedicated regulator of larval cell death, we find that E93 is expressed widely in adult cells at the pupal stage and is required for many patterning processes at this time. To understand the role of E93 in adult patterning, we focused on a simple E93-dependent process, the induction of the Dll gene within bract cells of the pupal leg by EGF receptor signaling. In this system, we show that E93 functions to cause Dll to become responsive to EGF receptor signaling. We demonstrate that E93 is both necessary and sufficient for directing this switch. E93 likely controls the responsiveness of many other target genes because it is required broadly for patterning during metamorphosis. The wide conservation of E93 orthologs suggests that similar mechanisms control life-cycle transitions in other organisms, including vertebrates.","Distal-less; Eip93F; Epidermal growth factor receptor;

To test these ideas, we analyze a 62. bp enhancer from the antennal gene spineless that is specific for the third antennal segment. This enhancer is activated by a tripartite complex of Distal-less, Homothorax, and Extradenticle. Surprisingly, Antennapedia represses the enhancer directly, at least in part by competing with Distal-less for binding. We show that Antennapedia is required in the leg only within a proximal ring that coexpresses Distal-less, Homothorax and Extradenticle. We conclude that the function of Antennapedia in the leg is not to repress homothorax, as has been suggested, but to directly repress spineless and other antennal genes that would otherwise be activated within this ring. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Antennapedia; Distal-less; Drosophila antenna; Extradenticle; Homothorax; Spineless","antennapedia protein; Distal less protein; extradenticle protein; Homothorax protein; transcription factor; unclassified drug; article; controlled study; enhancer region; gene; gene activation; gene control; gene function; gene interaction; gene repression; gene targeting; limb development; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; spineless gene; Animal Structures; Animals; Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein; Base Sequence; Clone Cells; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Extremities; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Insect; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Protein Binding; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Repressor Proteins",,"Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein; Antp protein, Drosophila; Drosophila Proteins; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Repressor Proteins; spineless protein, Drosophila",,,,"Abbott, M.K., Kaufman, T.C., The relationship between the functional complexity and the molecular organization of the Antennapedia locus of Drosophila melanogaster (1986) Genetics, 114, pp. 919-942; Abu-Shaar, M., Mann, R.S., Generation of multiple antagonistic domains along the proximodistal axis during Drosophila leg development (1998) Development, 125, pp. 3821-3830; Ades, S.E., Sauer, R.T., Specificity of minor-groove and major-groove interactions in a homeodomain-DNA complex (1995) Biochemistry, 34, pp. 14601-14608; Angelini, D.R., Kaufman, T.C., Insect appendages and comparative ontogenetics (2005) Dev.

The spineless (ss) gene encodes a bHLH-PAS transcription factor that plays a key role in specifying the identity of distal antennal segments. In this report, we identify the antennal disc enhancer of ss and then use enhancer-lacZ reporters to work out how ss antennal expression is regulated. The antennal determinants Distal-less (Dll) and homothorax (hth) are key activators of the antennal enhancer. Dll is required continuously and, when present at elevated levels, can activate the enhancer in regions devoid of hth expression. In contrast, homothorax (hth) is required only transiently both for activation of the enhancer and for specification of the aristal portion of the antenna. The antennal enhancer is repressed by cut, which determines its proximal limit of expression, and by ectopic Antennapedia (Antp). Repression by Antp is not mediated by hth, suggesting that ss may be a direct target of Antp. Finally, we show that ss+ is not a purely passive target of its regulators: ss+ partially represses hth in the third antennal segment and lies upstream of Dll in the development of the maxillary palp primordia. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called 'pale' and 'yellow', defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Random processes; Drosophila color vision; Photoreceptor cells; Retina; Color vision; Drosophila protein; protein Spineless; rhodopsin; transcription factor; unclassified drug; vision; article; cell fate; cell subpopulation; color vision; Drosophila; gene overexpression; nonhuman; photoreceptor; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; retina; retina cone",,"rhodopsin, 60383-01-9, 9009-81-8",,,,"Gegenfurtner, K.R., Kiper, D.C., Color vision (2003) Annu.

Despite intensive analysis in a number of laboratories, how ftz is regulated and how it controls its targets are still poorly understood. To help understand these processes, we conducted a screen to identify dominant mutations that enhance the lethality of a ftz temperature-sensitive mutant. Twenty-six enhancers were isolated, which define 21 genes. All but one of the mutations recovered show a maternal effect in their interaction with ftz. Three of the enhancers proved to be alleles of the known ftz protein cofactor gene ftz-f1, demonstrating the efficacy of the screen. Four enhancers are alleles of Atrophin (Atro), the Drosophila homolog of the human gene responsible for the neurodegenerative disease dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Embryos from Atro mutant germ-line mothers lack the even-numbered (ftz-dependent) engrailed stripes and show strong ftz-like segmentation defects. These defects likely result from a reduction in Even-skipped (Eve) repression ability, as Atro has been shown to function as a corepressor for Eve. In this study, we present evidence that Atro is also a member of the trithorax group (trxG) of Hox gene regulators. Atro appears to be particularly closely related in function to the trxG gene osa, which encodes a component of the brahma chromatin remodeling complex. One additional gene was identified that causes pair-rule segmentation defects in embryos from homozygous mutant germ-line mothers. The single allele of this gene, called bek, also causes nuclear abnormalities similar to those caused by alleles of the Trithorax-like gene, which encodes the GAGA factor.",,"protein; protein ftz; unclassified drug; allele; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; Atrophin gene; bek gene; brm gene; chromatin; controlled study; dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy; Drosophila; embryo; gene; gene expression; gene interaction; gene isolation; gene mapping; gene mutation; gene repression; genetic screening; germ line; Hox gene; lethality; mitosis; molecular cloning; nonhuman; osa gene; phenotype; priority journal; temperature sensitive mutant; trxG gene; Animals; Body Patterning; Cloning, Molecular; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Enhancer Elements (Genetics); Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Fushi Tarazu Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Screening; Homeodomain Proteins; Immunohistochemistry; Transcription Factors; Animalia",,"protein, 67254-75-5; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; even-skipped protein, Drosophila, 108911-13-3; ftz protein, Drosophila; Fushi Tarazu Transcription Factors; grunge protein, Drosophila; Homeodomain Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,"Ananthan, J., Baler, R., Morrissey, D., Zuo, J., Lan, Y., Synergistic activation of transcription is mediated by the N-terminal domain of Drosophila fushi tarazu homeoprotein and can occur without DNA binding by the protein (1993) Mol.

Drosophila NAB (dNAB), like its mammalian counterparts, binds EGR1 and represses EGR1-mediated transcriptional activation from a synthetic promoter. In contrast, dNAB does not bind the Drosophila EGR-related protein klumpfuss. dnab RNA is expressed exclusively in a subset of neuroblasts in the embryonic and larval central nervous system (CNS), as well as in several larval imaginal disc tissues. Here, we describe the creation of targeted deletion mutations in the dnab gene and the identification of additional, EMS-induced dnab mutations by genetic complementation analysis. Null alleles in dnab cause larval locomotion defects and early larval lethality (L1-L2). A putative hypomorphic allele in dnab instead causes early adult lethality due to severe locomotion defects. In the dnab -/- CNS, axon outgrowth/guidance and glial development appear normal; however, a subset of eve+ neurons forms in reduced numbers. In addition, mosaic analysis in the eye reveals that dnab -/- clones are either very small or absent. Similarly, dNAB overexpression in the eye causes eyes to be very small with few ommatidia. These dramatic eye-specific phenotypes will prove useful for enhancer/suppressor screens to identify dnab-interacting genes.","CNS; Co-repressor; Drosophila; EGR1; Neuroblast; NGFI-A; NGFI-A binding protein; Transcription","protein; protein NAB; unclassified drug; article; brain development; controlled study; deletion mutant; dNAB gene; eye development; gene; gene mutation; gene overexpression; genetic complementation; lethality; locomotion; molecular cloning; nervous system development; nonhuman; null allele; phenotype; priority journal; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Central Nervous System; Cloning, Molecular; Crosses, Genetic; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila; Drosophila Proteins; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Gene Deletion; Humans; Immediate-Early Proteins; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Neurons; Phenotype; Photoreceptors, Invertebrate; Protein Binding; Recombination, Genetic; Repressor Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Transfection; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; Hexapoda; Insecta; Mammalia",,"protein, 67254-75-5; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; Early Growth Response Protein 1; EGR1 protein, human; Immediate-Early Proteins; Klu protein, Drosophila; NAB protein, Drosophila; NAB1 protein, human; Repressor Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Factors",,,,"Ausubel, E.A., (2001) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Bellone, E., Di Maria, E., Soriani, S., Varese, A., Doria, L.L., Ajmar, F., Mandich, P., A novel mutation (D305V) in the early growth response 2 gene is associated with severe Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 disease (1999) Hum Mutat, 14, pp. 353-354; Boquet, I., Hitler, R., Dumas, M., Chaminade, M., Preat, T., Central brain postembryonic development in Drosophila: Implication of genes expressed at the interhemispheric junction (2000) J Neurobiol, 42, pp. 33-48; Bossing, T., Udolph, G., Doe, C.Q., Technau, G.M., The embryonic central nervous system lineages of Drosophila melanogaster.

Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7260, United States","The Drosophila spineless (ss) gene encodes a basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor that is required for proper specification of distal antennal establishment of the tarsal regions of the legs, and normal bristle growth. ss is the closest known homolog of the mammalian aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), also known as the dioxin receptor. Dioxin and other aryl hydrocarbons bind to the PAS domain of Ahr, causing Ahr to translocate to the nucleus, where it dimerizes with another bHLH-PAS protein, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt). Ahr:Arnt heterodimers then activate transcription of target genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolizing aryl hydrocarbons. In this report, we present evidence that Ss functions as a heterodimer with the Drosophila ortholog of Arnt, Tango (Tgo). We show that the ss and tgo genes have a close functional relationship: loss-of-function alleles of tgo were recovered as dominant enhancers of a ss mutation, and tgo-mutant somatic clones show antennal, leg, and bristle defects almost identical to those caused by ss- mutations. The results of yeast two-hybrid assays indicate that the Ss and Tgo proteins interact directly, presumably by forming heterodimers. Coexpression of Ss and Tgo in Drosophila SL2 cells causes transcriptional activation of reporters containing mammalian Ahr:Arnt response elements, indicating that Ss:Tgo heterodimers are very similar to Ahr:Arnt heterodimers in DNA-binding specificity and transcriptional activation ability. During embryogenesis, Tgo is localized to the nucleus at sites of ss expression. This localization is lost in a ss null mutant, suggesting that Tgo requires heterodimerization for translocation to the nucleus. Ectopic expression of ss causes coincident ectopic nuclear localization of Tgo, independent of cell type or developmental stage. This suggests that the interaction of Ss and Tgo does not require additional signals, unlike the ligand-dependent interaction of Ahr and Arnt. Despite the very different biological roles of Ahr and Arnt in insects and mammals, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins function appear to be largely conserved.","Antennal specification; Arnt; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Dioxin receptor; Drosophila; Homeotic gene; Limb development; PAS domain; Spineless-aristapedia; Tango","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; helix loop helix protein; transcription factor; animal tissue; article; controlled study; drosophila; embryo; embryo development; homeobox; limb development; mutant; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; protein protein interaction; reporter gene; transcription regulation; yeast; Alleles; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator; Base Sequence; Carrier Proteins; Dimerization; DNA, Complementary; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila; Drosophila Proteins; Enhancer Elements (Genetics); Extremities; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Insect; Insect Proteins; Mutation; Phenotype; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Sense Organs; Transcription Factors",,"Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator, 138391-32-9; Carrier Proteins; DNA, Complementary; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; Insect Proteins; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; spineless protein, Drosophila; tango protein, Drosophila; Transcription Factors",,,,"Brent, R., Interaction trap/two-hybrid system to identify interacting proteins (1994) Curr.

Loss-of-function alleles of ss cause three major phenotypes: transformation of distal antenna to leg, deletion of distal leg (tarsal) structures, and reduction in size of most bristles. Consistent with these phenotypes, ss is expressed in the distal portion of the antennal imaginal disc, the tarsal region of each leg disc, and in bristle precursor cells. Ectopic expression of ss causes transformation of the maxillary palp and distal leg to distal antenna, and induces formation of an ectopic antenna in the rostral membrane. These effects indicate that ss plays a primary role in specifying distal antennal identity. In the tarsus, ss is expressed only early, and is required for later expression of the tarsal gene bric a brac (bab). Ectopic expression causes the deletion of medial leg structures, suggesting that ss plays an instructive role in the establishment of the tarsal primordium. In both the antenna and leg, ss expression is shown to depend on Distal-less (Dll), a master regulator of ventral appendage formation. The antennal transformation and tarsal deletions caused by ss loss-of-function mutations are probably atavistic, suggesting that ss played a central role in the evolution of distal structures in arthropod limbs.","Antennal specification; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Dioxin receptor; Homeotic gene; Leg development; PAS domain; Spineless-aristapedia","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; helix loop helix protein; homeodomain protein; transcription factor; allele; animal cell; animal tissue; antenna; arthropod; article; controlled study; drosophila; gene mutation; limb development; molecular cloning; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein domain; protein family; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Drosophila; Drosophila Proteins; Evolution; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Insect; Humans; Insect Proteins; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phenotype; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Tarsus, Animal; Animalia; Arthropoda; Hexapoda; Mammalia","GENBANK: AF050630","DNA, Complementary; Drosophila Proteins; Insect Proteins; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; spineless protein, Drosophila",,,,"Abbot, M.K., Kaufman, T.C., The relationship between the functional complexity and the molecular organization of the Antennapedia locus of Drosophila melanogaster (1986) Genetics, 114, pp. 919-942; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

Here we focus on iab-5, iab-6 and iab-7, regulatory regions of Abd-B that control expression in the fifth, sixth and seventh abdominal segments (parasegments 10-12). By analysis of partial BX-C deficiencies, we show that these regions are able to promote fifth and sixth abdominal segments identities in the absence of an Abd-B gene in cis. We establish that this ability does not result from cis-regulation of the adjacent abd-A or Ubx genes of the BX-C but rather occurs because the iab-5,6,7 region is able to interact with Abd-B in trans. We demonstrate that this interaction is proximity dependent and is, therefore, a case of what E. B. Lewis has called transvection. Interactions of this type are presumably facilitated by the synapsis of homologues that occurs in somatic cells of Dipterans. Although transvection has been detected in a number of Drosophila genes, transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region is exceptional in two ways. First, interaction in trans with Abd-B does not require that homologous share homologous sequences within, or for some distance to either side of, the BX-C. This is the first case of transvection shown to be independent of local synapsis. A second unusual feature of iab- 5,6,7 transvection is that it is remarkably difficult to disrupt by heterozygosity for chromosome rearrangements. The lack of requirements for local synapsis and the tenacity of trans-interaction argue that the iab- 5,6,7 region can locate and interact with Abd-B over considerable distance. This is consistent with the normal role of iab-5,6,7, which must act over some 20-60 kb to influence its regulatory target in cis at the Abd-B promoter. Evidence is presented that trans-action of iab-5,6,7 requires, and may be mediated by, the region between distal iab-7 and Abd-B. Also, we show that iab-5,6,7 transvection is independent of the allelic state of zeste, a gene that influences several other cases of transvection. The long-range nature of interactions in trans between iab-5,6,7 and Abd-B suggests that similar interactions could operate effectively in organisms lacking extensive somatic pairing. Transvection may, therefore, be of more general significance than previously suspected.",,"article; chromosome rearrangement; drosophila melanogaster; embryo development; gene control; gene expression regulation; heterozygosity; homeobox; nonhuman; priority journal; regulator gene; Abdomen; Animal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Rearrangement; Genes, Insect; Heterozygote; Insect Hormones; Male; Mutation; Proteins; Recombination, Genetic; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Thorax; Translocation (Genetics)",,"abd-A protein, 132084-67-4; Abd-B proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Insect Hormones; Proteins; ultrabithorax protein; zeste protein",,,,,"Duncan, I.; Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, United States",,,,,,,,00166731,,GENTA,7713434,"English","GENETICS",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028813883
