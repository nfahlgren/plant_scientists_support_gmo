Methods: Homocysteine concentration in blood serum was determined in a group of 30 women with at least two subsequent miscarriages with no clear reason and in the control group consisted of 20 non-pregnant women without a medical history of obstetric failures, having at least one healthy child. In all cases Color Doppler sonography was performed to determine flow velocity waveforms of the uterine arteries in luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Results: Both pulsatility (PI) and resistance indices (RI) were considerably higher (p<0.01, p<0.05) for the group of women with recurrent abortions. In the group of women with obstetrical failures high positive correlation (R=0.6903, p<0.001) and in the control group very high positive correlation (r=0.8163, p<0.001) was found, between average values of PI and average HC concentration. High positive correlation (R=0.6260, p<0.001) in the examined group and very high positive correlation (r=0.9201, p<0.001) in the control group was obtained between average values of RI, and average HC concentrations in blood serum. Conclusions: The recurring miscarriages occur in connection with the elevated homocysteine concentration, in consequence they can point out the pathology within the uterine-fetal blood vessels. © 2007 Neuroendocrinology Letters.","Congenital hiperhomocysteinemia; Doppler blood flow; Homocysteine; Recurrent miscarriages; Uterine arteries","homocysteine; adult; amino acid blood level; artery blood flow; article; clinical article; color ultrasound flowmetry; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic value; disease marker; Doppler echography; female; fetoplacental unit; flow rate; human; luteal phase; menstrual cycle; pregnant woman; recurrent abortion; spontaneous abortion; uterine artery; uterus blood flow; vascular resistance; Abortion, Habitual; Adult; Arteries; Blood Flow Velocity; Case-Control Studies; Female; Homocysteine; Humans; Regional Blood Flow; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color; Uterus; Vascular Resistance",,"homocysteine, 454-28-4, 6027-13-0; Homocysteine, 454-28-4",,,,"Battaglia, C., Larocca, E., Lanzani, A., Doppler ultrasound studies of the uterine arteries in spontaneous and IVF stimulated ovarian cycles (1990) Gynecol Endocrinol, 4, p. 245; Battaglia, C., Sgarbi, L., Salvatori, M., Increased anticardiolipin antibodies are positively related to the uterine artery pulsatility index in unexplained infertility (1998) Hum Reprod, 13, p. 3487; Chambers, J.C., Ueland, P.M., Wright, M., Investigation of relationship between reduced, oxidized, and protein-bound homocysteine and vascular endothelial function in healthy human subjects (2001) Circ Res, 89, p. 187; Coppola, A., Davi, G., De-Stefano, V., Homocysteine, coagulation, platelet function, and thrombosis (2000) Semin Thromb Hemost, 26, p. 243; Cotter, A.M., Molloy, A.M., Scott, J.M., Elevated plasma homocysteine in early pregnancy: A risk factor for the development of nonsevere preeclampsia (2003) Am J Obstet Gynecol, 189, p. 391; Domagala, B., Sanak, M., Czachór, R., Hiperhomocysteinemia i jej zwiazek z miażdżyca tetnic.

Methods: 30 non-pregnant women with recurrent miscarriages (examined group-I) and for 20 non-pregnant women without obstetric failures in medical history (control group-II) were examined. Results: In the examined group (group I), the average concentration of homocysteine (9,45μmol/l) was not statistically higher in comparison to the control group (group II) (8,47μmol/l) (p&gt;0,05). In group I the average vitamin B12 concentration in blood serum was 178,3pg/ml and it was statistically lower (p&lt;0,00 1) in comparison with the control group (II) (268,6pg/ml). Such a relation was not observed for the vitamin B12, where the average concentration of this parameter was not dependant on the miscarriage number. A high negative correlation (R= -0,5397, p&lt;0,01) was observed between the level of folic acid and homocysteine concentration in the group of women with recurrent miscarriages and a very high negative correlation (r= -0,9586 p&lt;0,001) in the control group. No relation (R=0,0992 P0,05) between the average concentration of vitamin B12 in blood serum and the average homocysteine in the nullipara group with recurrent miscarriages. Conclusions: Together with the increasing number of abortions, the average homocysteine concentrations grew and the average folic acid concentrations lowered. © 2007 Neuroendocrinology Letters.","Early pregnancy; Folic acid; Homocysteine; Recurrent miscarriages; Vitamin B12 serum concentration","cyanocobalamin; folic acid; homocysteine; adult; amino acid analysis; amino acid blood level; anamnesis; article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic value; disease marker; female; folic acid blood level; human; nullipara; pregnant woman; recurrent abortion; spontaneous abortion; vitamin blood level; Abortion, Habitual; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Folic Acid; Folic Acid Deficiency; Homocysteine; Humans; Vitamin B 12",,"cyanocobalamin, 53570-76-6, 68-19-9, 8064-09-3; folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; homocysteine, 454-28-4, 6027-13-0; Folic Acid, 59-30-3; Homocysteine, 454-28-4; Vitamin B 12, 68-19-9",,,,"Brattström, L.E., Israelson, B., Jeppson, J.O., Hultberg, B.L., Folic acid - an innocuous means to reduce plasma homocysteine (1988) Scand J Clin Invest, 48, pp. 215-221; Cichocka, A., Cybulska, B., Homocysteina - mniej poznany czynnik ryzyka chorób sercowo naczyniowych.[(Homocysteine - less known risk factor of cardio-vascular diseases)) (In Polish with English abstract) (1999) Med Metabol, 2 (3), pp. 42-49; Chambers, J.C., Ueland, P.M., Wright, M., Investigation of relationship between reduced, oxidized, and protein - bound homocysteine and vascular endothelial function in healthy human subjects (2001) Circ Res, pp. 287-294; Clarke, R., Brattström, L., Landgren, F., Israelsson, B., Lowerig blood homocysteine with folic acid based suplementes: Metaanalysis of randomized trial (1999) Brit Med J, 316 (7135), pp. 894-898; Collins, J., Roberts, R., Reports of independent analyses of data from the world wide prospective collaborative study of immunotherapy for unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (1994) Am J Reprod Immunol, 32 (4), pp. 275-280; Coppola, A., Davi, G., De-Stefano, V., Homocysteine, coagulation, platelet function and thrombosis (2000) Semin Tromb Hemost, 26, pp. 243-254; Cotter, A.M., Molloy, A.M., Scott, J.M., Daly Sean, F., Elevated plasma homocysteine in early pregnacy: A risk factor for the development of nonsevere preeclapsia (2003) Am J Obstet Gynecol, 189 (2), pp. 391-394; Coulam, C.B., Epidemiology of recurrent sponataneous abortion (1991) Am J Repord Immunol, 26, pp. 23-27; Domagała, B., Sanak, M., Czachór, R., Szczeklik, A., Hiperhomocysteinemia i jej zwiazek z miażdżyca tetnic.
