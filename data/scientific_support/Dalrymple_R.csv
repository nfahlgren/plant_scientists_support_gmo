While sexually reproducing introduced herbs have proven capable of rapid evolution, no previous study has quantified morphological changes in multiple obligatory asexually reproducing introduced species, or asked whether their potential for change differs from that of sexual species. We measured herbarium specimens of eight asexual species introduced to Australia and/or New Zealand. We quantified changes in leaf area, leaf shape, leaf mass per area, plant height and internode length through time since the species' introduction. Half of the asexual species demonstrated significant change in at least one trait. The observed changes were substantial - up to 561% per 100 years. The proportion of species showing at least one significant morphological change did not differ significantly between our asexual species, and data measured in the same manner for 34 sexually reproducing introduced species. There was also no significant difference in the rate of morphological change in sexual versus asexual species. That is, we found that sexual species have not changed more often, or more quickly than their asexual counterparts. Our results show that asexually reproducing species can undergo rapid morphological change at a rate matching that of sexually reproducing species when introduced to a new range. Our results also suggest that asexually reproducing plants may be able to respond to changing conditions better than was previously appreciated. © 2014 The Authors.",,"herb; introduced species; leaf area; morphology; vegetative propagation; Australia; New Zealand",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.F., Evolution of sex: why do organisms shuffle their genotypes?

However, advances in colour quantification and analysis only now allow an objective test of this idea. We provide the first quantitative analysis of the latitudinal gradient in colour on a broad scale using data from both animals and plants, encompassing both human-visible and ultraviolet colours. Location: Australia. Methods: We collected spectral reflectance data from 570 species or subspecies of birds, adult forms of 424 species or subspecies of butterflies and the flowers of 339 species of plants, from latitudes ranging from tropical forests and savannas at 9.25°S, to temperate forests and heathlands at 43.75°S. Colour patch saturation, maximum contrast between patches, colour diversity and hue disparity between patches were calculated for all species. Latitudinal gradients in colour were analysed using both regression analyses and comparisons of categorically temperate and tropical regions. We also provide phylogenetically independent contrast analyses. Results: The analyses which compared the colour traits of communities and the phylogenetically independent contrasts both show that species in the tropics are not more colourful than those at higher latitudes. Rather, the cross-species analyses indicate that species further away from the equator possess a greater diversity of colours, and their colours are more contrasting and more saturated than those seen in tropical species. These results remain consistent regardless of whether the mean or the maximum of coloration indices are considered. Main conclusions: We demonstrate that birds, butterflies and flowers display similar gradients of colourfulness across latitudes, indicating strong ecological and evolutionary cohesion. However, our data do not support the idea that tropical latitudes contain the most colourful species or house the more colourful biological communities. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Biogeography; Birds; Butterflies; Colour; Flowers; Latitude; Tropical biology","bird; butterfly; color; community dynamics; heathland; latitudinal gradient; patch dynamics; temperate forest; trophic structure; Australia; Animalia; Aves; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"Adams, J.M., Kang, C., June-Wells, M., Are tropical butterflies more colorful?

However, it has not been determined how many replicates one needs to accurately quantify a species' colours for studies aimed at broad cross-species trait comparison. We address this major methodological knowledge gap. We first quantified and assessed the variance in colour within and between species. Reflectance spectra of flowers from ten plant species and plumage of 20 bird species were measured using a spectrometer, and reflectance (i.e. brightness) and tetrahedral colour-space coordinates were calculated. analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses indicate that there is far more variation in the colours of birds and flowers between species (>77%) than within species. A Mean Absolute Deviation from the Mean test was applied to indicate the sampling replication required for each species. Tetrahedral coordinates were sampled precisely with only one individual per species. Greater replication was needed to sample reflectance with the desired precision, particularly for darker coloured species. Our findings will allow researchers to allocate their sampling effort in a way that maximises the precision of their colour data collection. The fact that only a few replicates per species are necessary will greatly facilitate broad cross-species comparisons of colour in the future. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 114, 69-81. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London.","Bird; Colour; Flower; Reflectance; Sampling; Sampling precision; Variation","bird; color; data acquisition; flower; genetic variation; sampling; species diversity; variance analysis; Aves; Rosa; Viola",,,,,,"Albert, A.Y.K., Millar, N.P., Schluter, D., Character displacement of male nuptial colour in threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2007) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 91, pp. 37-48; Aldrich, J.W., James, F.C., Ecogeographic variation in the American Robin (Turdus migratorius) (1991) The Auk, 108, pp. 230-249; Anderson, C.N., Grether, G.F., Character displacement in the fighting colours of Hetaerina damselflies (2010) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 277, pp. 3669-3675; Anderson, M.J., A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (2006) Austral Ecology, 26, pp. 32-46; Andersson, S., Prager, M., Quantifying colors (2006) Bird coloration: mechanisms and measurements, pp. 41-89. , Hill GE, McGraw KJ, eds.
