The compositional balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids plays a decisive role in maintaining the physiological harmony, proper growth and development in the human system. In case of Brassica juncea seed oil, the level of saturated fatty acid, especially desirable stearate is very much lower than the recommended value, along with a high content of nutritionally undesirable erucic acid. Therefore, in order to shift the carbon flux towards the production of stearate at the expense of erucate, the MlFatB gene encoding a FatB thioesterase from Madhuca longifolia (latifolia) was expressed heterologously in seed tissues of B. juncea. The functional MlFatB competed with the highly active endogenous BjFatA thioesterase, and the transgenic B. juncea lines showed noteworthy changes in their seed fatty acid profiles. The proportion of stearate increased up to 16-fold, constituting almost 31% of the total fatty acids along with the production of arachidic acid in significant amount (up to ~11%). Moreover, the content of erucate was reduced up to 71% in the seed oils of transgenic lines. Although a nutritionally desirable fatty acid profile was achieved, the transgenic seeds exhibit reduction or abolition of seed germination in addition to a decrease in seed lipid content. The findings of the present study revealing the stearoyl-ACP thioesterase-mediated enhancement of the stearate content that is associated with reduced germination frequency of transgenic B. juncea seeds, may explain why no natural or induced stearate-rich Brassica has been found or developed. Furthermore, this study also suggests that the newly characterized MlFatB is a potential candidate gene for refined metabolic engineering strategy in B. juncea or other plant species for increasing stearate content in seed oil. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Brassica juncea (Indian mustard); Erucic acid; FatB thioesterase; Fatty acid biosynthesis; Metabolic engineering; Seed lipid; Stearic acid",,,,,,,"Bevan, M., Barnes, W.M., Chitton, M.D., Structure and transcription of the nopaline synthase gene region of T-DNA (1983) Nucl.

Abstract: In plants, plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturase-7 (FAD7) catalyzes the formation of C16 and C18 trienoic fatty acids using organellar glycerolipids and participate in the membrane lipid formation. The plastidial ω-3 desaturases (FAD7) share high sequence homology with the microsomal ω-3 desaturases (FAD3) at the amino acid level except the N-terminal organelle transit peptide. In the present study, the predicted N-terminal plastidial signal peptide of fad7 gene was replaced by the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide and an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal was placed at the C-terminal. The expression of the modified sesame ω-3 desaturase increases the α-linolenic acid content in the range of 4.78–6.77 % in the seeds of transgenic tobacco plants with concomitant decrease in linoleic acid content. The results suggested the potential of the engineered plastidial ω-3 desaturase from sesame to influence the profile of α-linolenic acid in tobacco plant by shifting the carbon flux from linoleic acid, and thus it can be used in suitable genetic engineering strategy to increase the α-linolenic acid content in sesame and other vegetable oils. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Endoplasmic reticulum; Nicotiana tabacum; Plastid; Sesamum indicum; ω-3 Fatty acid desaturase",,,,,,,,"Sen, S.K.; Advanced Laboratory for Plant Genetic Engineering, Indian Institute of TechnologyIndia",,,"Springer Verlag",,,,,07217714,,PCRPD,,"English","Plant Cell Rep.",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945566798

Heme, one of the products of this branched pathway is well known to regulate the pathway through feedback inhibition. Since the accumulation of intermediates of tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway is found to be cytotoxic and inducer of plant programmed cell death through retrograde signalling, certain role of heme in regulating plant cell death is quite logical. In the present study, we report the in vivo heme-binding property of OsHFP, a novel hemopexin fold protein from the rice (Oryza sativa) plant, and document the effect of heme–OsHFP interaction on oxidative stress responses in bacterial and plant systems. The bound heme is retained by the OsHFP even in presence of SDS, and the amount of bound heme to OsHFP increases upon exogenous application of heme biosynthetic precursor in Escherichia coli. In heme-replete condition, the recombinant OsHFP alters the oxidative stress response in E. coli. Ectopic expression of the OsHFP generates oxidative stress in tobacco leaves, which is visualized through the induction of superoxide dismutase activity and localized accumulation of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. On the basis of the findings from the present study and the available literature, we propose a possible mode of action of OsHFP in regulating cell death in plant system, which might signify the yet-to-be-deciphered physiological role of hemopexin fold proteins in plants. © 2015, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.","5-Aminolevulinic acid; Cell death; Heme; OsHFP; Oxidative stress; Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis","Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Nicotiana tabacum; Oryza sativa",,,,,,"Banerjee, J., Maiti, M.K., Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance (2010) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 394, pp. 178-183. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXjvFKit7c%3D, PID: 20188068; Beyer, W.F., Jr., Fridovich, I., Effect of hydrogen peroxide on the iron-containing superoxide dismutase of Escherichia coli (1987) Biochemistry, 26, pp. 1251-1257. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaL2sXpvVCrsQ%3D%3D, PID: 3552043; Bougri, O., Grimm, B., Members of a low-copy number gene family encoding glutamyl-tRNA reductase are differentially expressed in barley (1996) Plant J, 9, pp. 867-878. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK28XksFyqsrk%3D, PID: 8696365; Carroll, J.A., Coleman, S.A., Smitherman, L.S., Minnick, M.F., Hemin-binding surface protein from Bartonella quintana (2000) Infect Immun, 68, pp. 6750-6757. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3MXjslCkt7k%3D, PID: 11083791; Chattopadhyay, T., Bhattacharyya, S., Das, A.K., Maiti, M.K., A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation (2012) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 420, pp. 862-868. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xlt1KksL4%3D, PID: 22465006; Chattopadhyay, T., Roy, S., Maiti, M.K., Spatio-temporal regulation of the OsHFP gene promoter establishes the involvement of this protein in rice anther development (2012) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 426, pp. 280-285. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhtlGqu7vO, PID: 22943852; Cornah, J.E., Roper, J.M., Pal Singh, D., Smith, A.G., Measurement of ferrochelatase activity using a novel assay suggests that plastids are the major site of haem biosynthesis in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic cells of pea (Pisum sativum L.)

The benefits of a nano-pesticide formulation can be further expanded by adding to its arsenal both tracking ability and precise control over the pesticide release. Recently, fluorescent photoresponsive nanocarriers have gained considerable momentum in the field of drug delivery since they can act as both a ""fluorophore"" for cell luminescence imaging and a ""phototrigger"" for regulated drug release by external light stimuli. Hence, we report for the first time a nano-pesticide formulation based on fluorescent photoresponsive organic nanoparticles of perylene-3-ylmethanol for regulated release of pesticide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Further, the fluorescent nature of the photoresponsive organic nanoparticles was used to study the morphological changes induced by 2,4-D inside the plant system using confocal imaging studies. Additionally, the fluorescent colour change by photoresponsive organic nanoparticles before and after photorelease was exploited for real time monitoring of 2,4-D release inside the plants. Bioassay experiments revealed that nano-pesticide, Pe-2,4-D efficiently delivered 2,4-D inside the plant tissues improving its herbicidal activity. Such photoresponsive multifunctional nanocarriers with good fluorescence, cellular uptake property and efficient photoregulated release ability will be of great benefit in the construction of nano-pesticide formulations. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bioassay; Fluorescence; Morphology; Nanoparticles; Real time systems; 2 ,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2 ,4-D); Herbicidal activity; Luminescence imaging; Morphological changes; Multi-functional nanocarriers; Organic nanoparticles; Pesticide formulations; Real time monitoring; Pesticides",,,,,,"Kah, M., Beulke, S., Tiede, K., Hofmann, T., (2013) Crit.

Among the GA-signaling mutants, the gai (GA insensitive) gene has been well studied in Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.] system. The wild-type GAI, being a DELLA-family protein, acts as a nuclearlocalized GA-signaling repressor that restrains the expression of other genes associated with GA-induced growth processes. Here we document alteration in GA-dependent multiple responses obtained through overexpression and expression of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) wild-type GAI (OsGAI) gene in the endogenous (rice) and heterologous (tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum L.]) plant systems, respectively. In both cases, the transgenic lines were found to have significantly reduced plant height, decreased seed α-amylase activity, reduced early seedling growth, a higher level of anthocyanin pigmentation, and reduced stem cell-wall lignifications. Leaf chlorophyll content was found to be increased in transgenic rice but decreased in transgenic tobacco lines. The reduced lignification in transgenic tobacco was observed to be reversible on exogenous GA application and correlated to the hypersensitivity toward oxidative stress. Findings of the present research advance our understanding on the complex interplay between GAI and interacting molecules responsible for several physiological processes in plant systems. © Crop Science Society of America.

Previously, we have characterized an endophytic filamentous fungus Colletotrichum sp. DM06 that can produce total lipid ranging from 34% to 49% of its dry cell weight (DCW) upon growing with various carbon sources and nutrient-stress conditions. In the present study, we report on the genetic transformation of this fungal strain with the CtDGAT2b gene, which encodes for a catalytically efficient isozyme of type-2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) from oleaginous yeast Candida troplicalis SY005. Besides the increase in size of lipid bodies, total lipid titer by the transformed Colletotrichum (lipid content ∼73% DCW) was found to be ∼1.7-fold more than the wild type (lipid content ∼38% DCW) due to functional activity of the CtDGAT2b transgene when grown under standard condition of growth without imposition of any nutrient-stress. Analysis of lipid fractionation revealed that the neutral lipid titer in transformants increased up to 1.8-, 1.6- and 1.5-fold compared to the wild type when grown under standard, nitrogen stress and phosphorus stress conditions, respectively. Lipid titer of transformed cells was further increased to 1.7-fold following model-based optimization of culture conditions. Taken together, ∼2.9-fold higher lipid titer was achieved in Colletotrichum fungus due to overexpression of a rate-limiting crucial enzyme of lipid biosynthesis coupled with prediction-based bioprocess optimization. ©2014 Dey et al.",,"carbon; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; isoenzyme; lipid; nitrogen; phosphorus; DGA1 protein, S cerevisiae; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; lipid; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; Article; bioprocess; carbon source; catalysis; cell transformation; Colletotrichum; controlled study; culture optimization; fungal strain; fungus growth; genetic code; genetic transformation; lipid analysis; lipogenesis; microalga; nonhuman; Ocimum tenuiflorum; prediction; protein expression; wild type; yeast; biosynthesis; Colletotrichum; genetics; metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Colletotrichum; Fungi; Colletotrichum; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Lipids; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; diacylglycerol acyltransferase, 9029-98-5; lipid, 66455-18-3; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; DGA1 protein, S cerevisiae; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Lipids; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,,,"Ratledge, C., Regulation of lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms (2002) Biochem Soc Trans, 30, pp. 1047-1050; Gatenby, C.M., Orcutt, D.M., Kreeger, D.A., Parker, B.C., Jones, V.A., Biochemical composition of three algal species proposed as food for captive freshwater mussels (2003) J Appl Phycol, 15, pp. 1-11; Walker, T.L., Purton, S., Becker, D.K., Collet, C., Microalgae as bioreactors (2005) Plant Cell Rep, 24, pp. 629-641; Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae (2007) Biotechnol Adv, 25, pp. 294-306; Li, Q., Du, W., Liu, D., Perspectives of microbial oils for biodiesel production (2008) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 80, pp. 749-756; Meng, X., Yang, J., Xu, X., Zhang, L., Nie, Q., Biodiesel production from oleogenous microorganisms (2009) Renew Energ, 34, pp. 1-5; Beopoulos, A., Cescut, J., Haddouche, R., Uribelarrea, J.L., Jouve, C.M., Yarrowia lipolytica as a model for biooil production (2009) Prog Lipid Res, 48, pp. 375-387; Ageitos, M.J., Vallejo, A.J., Veiga-Crespo, P., Villa, G.T., Oily yeasts as oleaginous cell factories (2011) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 90, pp. 1219-1227; Fakas, S., Papanikolaou, S., Batsos, A., Galiotou-Panayotou, M., Mallouchos, A., Evaluating renewable carbon sources as substrates for single cell oil production by cunninghamella echinulata and mortierella isabellina (2009) Biomass Bioenerg, 33, pp. 573-580; Dey, P., Banerjee, J., Maiti, M.K., Comparative lipid profiling of two endophytic fungal isolates - Colletotrichum sp.

Previously, we characterized an oleaginous yeast Candida tropicalis SY005 that yields storage lipid up to 58% under a specific nitrogen-stress condition, when the DGATspecific transcript is drastically up-regulated. Here we report the identification, differential expression and function of two DGAT2 gene homologues- CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b of this C. tropicalis. Two protein isoforms are unique with respect to the presence of five additional stretches of amino acids, besides possessing three highly conserved motifs known in other reported DGAT2 enzymes. Moreover, the CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are characteristically different in amino acid sequences and predicted protein structures. The CtDGAT2b isozyme was found to be catalytically 12.5% more efficient than CtDGAT2a for triacylglycerol production in a heterologous yeast system i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant strain H1246 that is inherently defective in neutral lipid biosynthesis. The CtDGAT2b activity rescued the growth of transformed S. cerevisiae mutant cells, which are usually non-viable in the medium containing free fatty acids by incorporating them into triacylglycerol, and displayed preferential specificity towards saturated acyl species as substrate. Furthermore, we document that the efficiency of triacylglycerol production by CtDGAT2b is differentially affected by deletion, insertion or replacement of amino acids in five regions exclusively present in two CtDGAT2 isozymes. Taken together, our study characterizes two structurally novel DGAT2 isozymes, which are accountable for the enhanced production of storage lipid enriched with saturated fatty acids inherently in C. tropicalis SY005 strain as well as in transformed S. cerevisiae neutral lipid-deficient mutant cells.

Lab. for Plant Genetic Engineering, Advanced Technology Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India","Rice bran oil (RBO), being naturally rich in antioxidants, is currently regarded as one of the health-beneficial edible oils. However, the RBO has essential linoleic acid (ω-6, C18:2) and α-linolenic acid (ω-3, C18:3) in nutritionally disproportionate level (~25:1), contrary to the WHO/FAO’s recommendation of ~5:1. Among few naturally occurring C18:3 enriched oil-seeds, Brassica juncea (Indian mustard) has almost equal proportion of ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids in its oil due to the activity of microsomal ω-3 desaturase (Fad3), which converts C18:2–C18:3. Therefore, the full length Fad3 coding DNA sequence (CDS) was isolated from the developing seeds of B. juncea, functionally characterized and heterologously expressed for the nutritional enhancement of RBO. Sequence analysis revealed that the 1,134 bp long BjFad3 CDS corresponds to a polypeptide of 377 amino acids, which is highly (85–95 %) homologous to other known Fad3 enzymes of plant kingdom. The BjFad3 gene was initially characterized in transgenic tobacco to establish its linoleate desaturase activity. Thereafter, rice bran-specific expression of the BjFad3 was carried out to alter the fatty acid profile of RBO. Several independent transgenic lines of tobacco and rice plants were developed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Standard molecular biological techniques were used to confirm the transgene integration in the respective genomes and subsequent in planta expression. The BjFad3 transgene expression correlated to the significant increase in C18:3 fatty acid content (up to tenfold) in both tobacco seed oil and RBO, and thereby improving the nutritionally desirable ω-6:ω-3 ratio (~2:1) in one of the transgenic rice lines. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bran-specific transgene expression;

Results revealed increased expression of gusA gene in tobacco seed tissue when driven by sesame 2S albumin promoter. Prediction based deletion analysis of both the promoter elements confirmed the necessary cis-acting regulatory elements as well as the minimal promoter element for optimal expression in each case. The results also revealed that cis-regulatory elements might have been responsible for high level expression as well as spatio-temporal regulation of the sesame 2S albumin promoter. Transgenic over-expression of a fatty acid desaturase (fad3C) gene of soybean driven by 2S albumin promoter resulted in seed-specific enhanced level of α-linolenic acid in sesame. The present study, for the first time helped to identify that the sesame 2S albumin promoter is a promising endogenous genetic element in genetic engineering approaches requiring spatio-temporal regulation of gene(s) of interest in sesame and can also be useful as a heterologous genetic element in other important oil seed crop plants in general for which seed oil is the harvested product. The study also established the feasibility of fatty acid metabolic engineering strategy undertaken to improve quality of edible seed oil in sesame using the 2S albumin promoter as regulatory element. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2S albumin; Fatty acid desaturase (fad3); gusA; Seed-specific expression; Sesame; α-Linolenic acid (ALA)","acyl coenzyme A desaturase; beta glucuronidase; fatty acid; linolenic acid; napin; vegetable oil; vegetable protein; crop; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolic engineering; metabolism; plant seed; procedures; promoter region; regulatory sequence; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sesamum; soybean; tobacco; transgenic plant; Western blotting; 2S Albumins, Plant; alpha-Linolenic Acid; Blotting, Western; Crops, Agricultural; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucuronidase; Metabolic Engineering; Plant Oils; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Seeds; Sesamum; Soybeans; Tobacco",,"acyl coenzyme A desaturase, 9014-34-0; beta glucuronidase, 9001-45-0; linolenic acid, 1955-33-5, 463-40-1; napin, 89147-51-3; 2S Albumins, Plant; alpha-Linolenic Acid; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Fatty Acids; Glucuronidase; Plant Oils; Plant Proteins",,,,"Abbadi, A., Domergue, F., Bauer, J., Napier, J.A., Welti, R., Zahringer, U., Cirpus, P., Heinz, E., Biosynthesis of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in transgenic oilseeds: constraints on their accumulation (2004) Plant Cell, 16, pp. 2734-2748. , PID: 15377762, COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXptVShsrk%3D; Anai, T., Koga, M., Tanaka, H., Kinoshita, T., Rahman, M.S., Takagi, Y., Improvement of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed oil quality through introduction of a soybean microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene (2003) Plant Cell Rep, 21, pp. 988-992. , PID: 12835909, COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXkvVOqsb8%3D; Argos, P., Pedersen, K., Marks, M.D., Larklns, B.A., A structural model for maize zein proteins (1982) J Biol Chem, 257, pp. 9984-9990. , PID: 7107620, COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaL38XlsVSmsb4%3D; Ashri, A., Sesame (1989) Oil crops of the world: their breeding and utilization, pp. 375-387. , Robbelen G, Downey RK, Ashri A, (eds), McGraw Hill, NY:; Baud, S., Lepiniec, L., Physiological and developmental regulation of seed oil production (2010) Prog Lipid Res, 49, pp. 235-249. , PID: 20102727, COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXmtFWhtLg%3D; Baydar, H., Turgut, I., Turgut, K., Variation of certain characters and line selection for yield, oil, oleic acid and linoleic acid in Turkish sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) population (1999) Turk J Agric For, 23, pp. 431-441; Bhaskaran, P., Jayabalan, N., In vitro mass propagation and diverse callus orientation on Sesamum indicum L.—an important oil plant (2006) J Agric Tech, 2, pp. 259-269; Bilyeu, K.D., Palavalli, L., Sleper, D.A., Beuselinck, P.R., Three microsomal omega-3 fatty-acid desaturase genes contribute to soybean linolenic acid levels (2003) Crop Sci, 43, pp. 1833-1838. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXnvVSktrk%3D; Bradford, M.M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein–dye binding (1976) Anal Biochem, 72, pp. 248-254. , PID: 942051, COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaE28XksVehtrY%3D; Browse, J., IMcCourt, P., Somerville, C., A mutant of Arabidopsis deficient in C18:3 and C16:3 leaf lipids (1986) Plant Physiol, 81, pp. 859-864. , PID: 16664915, COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaL28Xls12jtbk%3D; Browse, J., McConn, M., James, D., Miquel, M., Mutants of Arabidopsis, deficient in the synthesis of α-linolenate.

Plant-derived compounds have been proposed to overcome this problem, including the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). This paper reports the identification of Ps-AFP1, a novel AMP isolated from the Pisum sativum radicle. Ps-AFP1 was purified and evaluated against phytopathogenic fungi, showing clear effectiveness. In silico analyses were performed, suggesting an unusual fold and disulfide bond pattern. A novel fold and a novel AMP class were here proposed, the αβ-trumpet fold and αβ-trumpet peptides, respectively. The name αβ-trumpet was created due to the peptide's fold, which resembles the musical instrument. The Ps-AFP1 mechanism of action was also proposed. Microscopic analyses revealed that Ps-AFP1 could affect the fungus during the hyphal elongation from spore germination. Furthermore, confocal microscopy performed with Ps-AFP1 labeled with FITC shows that the peptide was localized at high concentration along the fungal cell surface. Due to low cellular disruption rates, it seems that the main target is the fungal cell wall. The binding thermogram and isothermal titration, molecular dynamics and docking analyses were also performed, showing that Ps-AFP1 could bind to chitin producing a stable complex. Data here reported provided novel structural-functional insights into the αβ-trumpet peptide fold. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods and Results: Upon growing C. tropicalis on various carbon substrates, glucose was found to be the best followed by xylose for the production of both biomass and storage lipid. On glucose (100 g l-1) medium having specific nitrogen stress (C:N 150 : 1), the yeast was capable of yielding about 58% lipid content of its dry biomass, and neutral lipid accounted for about 75% of the total lipid. Fatty acid profiles revealed that the glucose contributed to the highest yield of total fatty acids, maximum proportion of saturated fatty acids and a significant amount of oleic acid. The enhanced lipid production with specific fatty acid profile correlated with the strong upregulation of acetyl Co-A carboxylase, stearoyl-ACP desaturase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes, but not the malic enzyme gene. Conclusions: Together, the results documented the differential regulation of four genes of lipid biosynthesis in the newly isolated C. tropicalis oleaginous strain by various carbon sources. Significance and Impact of the Study: We report here on optimization of the carbon substrate for improved lipid yield and transcriptional regulation of lipid biosynthetic genes in C. tropicalis.

DM-06. After purification, the MIC value of exAFP-C28 against Candida albicans, a well-known human pathogenic fungus was found to be 32 βg/mL that unaffected the human red blood cells. The antifungal activity associated with exAFP-C28 was manifested by the increased membrane permeability of C. albicans cells followed by disruption. Proteomics and bioinformatics analyses revealed that several peptide fragments of exAFP-C28 have identity with the bacterial 50S ribosomal protein L10, and a stretch of 55 amino acids of two peptide fragments corresponding to the Nterminus of L10 protein is capable of forming amphipathic helix required for membrane penetration. Taken together, our results suggest that the exAFP-C28 protein from Colletotrichum sp.

The PCD necessitates a properly tuned transcriptional regulation of some crucial genes. However, the detailed genetic regulation of this PCD in rice anther is yet to be deciphered. Recently, we have established that the OsHFP, a structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice is a flower-specific heme binding protein, and plays a role in chlorophyll degradation. Here, we report the spatio-temporal transcriptional regulation of the OsHFP gene, which is proposed to be involved in anther PCD. The OsHFP was immunodetected in rice anthers, and OsHFP-related proteins were also found to be present in anthers of other monocot (lily) and dicot (tobacco) plant species. Unique cis-acting elements, possibly involved in the activation and anther-specificity of the OsHFP promoter were identified based upon in silico prediction and in planta expression profiling of the reporter gene driven by the OsHFP promoter (2051. bp) and its two deleted versions (1057. bp and 437. bp). The temporal regulation of the OsHFP promoter in different developmental stages of tobacco anther implies the physiological function of this protein in anther PCD. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..","Anther dehiscence; Cis-Regulatory elements; GusA reporter gene; Hemopexin fold protein; Programmed cell death","hemopexin; anther; article; cell death; controlled study; gene; gene control; gene expression; immunodetection; lily; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oshfp gene; plant growth; priority journal; protein analysis; protein folding; rice; tobacco; Apoptosis; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hemopexin; Oryza sativa; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Dicotyledoneae; Lilium; Nicotiana tabacum","GENBANK: ADR30065, AET02245, CAA50008, JX233809, P08688","hemopexin, 9013-71-2; Hemopexin, 9013-71-2; Plant Proteins",,,,"Kamalay, J.C., Goldberg, R.B., Regulation of structural gene expression in tobacco (1980) Cell, 19, pp. 935-946; Kamalay, J.C., Goldberg, R.B., Organ-specific nuclear RNAs in tobacco (1984) Proc.

The present study reports pdhk gene downregulation effects on maturation time of a late maturing, aromatic, native indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar, Badshahbhog. A double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA)-mediated gene silencing strategy was used to downregulate rice mitochondrial pdhk gene expression. The transgenic plant lines displayed altered growth patterns-early flower initiation, increased grain formation per panicle, and ~10 d earlier maturation-compared to a nontransformed cultivar. Northern blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses provided evidence for endogenous pdhk gene downregulation in T0T1, and T2 generations of transgenic rice lines. These results provided evidence for stable pdhk gene downregulation throughout filial generations. It was further observed that transgenic lines with two insertion events of transferred dsRNA effected more downregulation of pdhk gene expression relative to rice lines carrying a single dsRNA insertion. © Crop Science Society of America.",,"Eukaryota; Oryza sativa",,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

In spite of their immense importance, the fatty acid profiles of most oilseed crops are imbalanced that necessitate the use of metabolic engineering strategies to overcome the various shortfalls in order to improve the nutritional quality of these edible oils. Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.), being one of the important oilseed crops in Indian subcontinent naturally contains ∼50 % nutritionally undesirable very long chain unsaturated fatty acids (VLCUFAs), e.g. erucic acid (C22:1). For the purpose of nutritional improvement of B. juncea seed oil, several metabolic engineering strategies have been employed to divert the carbon flux from the production of VLCUFAs to other important fatty acids. Stearic acid, being a saturated but nutritionally neutral fatty acid, is naturally inadequate in most of the conventional oil seeds. Due to its neutral effect on consumer's health and as an important industrial ingredient, increased in planta production of stearic acid in the seed oil not only helps in reduction of production cost but also lessens the trans fatty acid production during commercial hydrogenation process. In this review metabolic engineering strategies to minimize the VLCUFAs along with increased production of stearic acid in the seed oil of B. juncea are discussed, so that further breeding attempts can be made to improve the nutritionally desirable fatty acid profile in the suitable cultivars of this important oilseed crop. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Edible oil;

In order to investigate the structure and function of this type of protein in rice plant (. Oryza sativa), the gene encoding a hemopexin fold protein (OsHFP) was cloned, analyzed . in silico and characterized. Molecular modeling revealed that the OsHFP is closely related to other hemopexin fold proteins, but is unique with a cylindrical central tunnel as well as extended N- and C-terminal domains. The recombinant OsHFP was found to bind hemin, the oxidized form of heme . in vitro. The expression of the single copy . OsHFP gene was detected in rice flower buds. Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue. The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Chlorophyll degradation; Hemin; Hemopexin fold protein; OsHFP; Rice anther","chlorophyll; hemin; hemopexin; Oryza sativa hemopexin fold protein; recombinant protein; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; apoptosis; article; biodegradation; carboxy terminal sequence; computer model; controlled study; hairy root culture; in vitro study; leaf tissue; molecular cloning; molecular model; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidation; priority journal; protein analysis; protein binding; protein function; protein structure; rice; stable expression; transgenic plant; Chlorophyll; Hemopexin; Models, Chemical; Oryza sativa; Plant Proteins; Protein Conformation; Protein Folding; Oryza sativa","GENBANK: CAE03710","chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; hemin, 16009-13-5; hemopexin, 9013-71-2; Chlorophyll, 1406-65-1; Hemopexin, 9013-71-2; Plant Proteins",,,,"Piccard, H., Van den Steen, P.E., Opdenakker, G., Hemopexin domains as multifunctional liganding modules in matrix metalloproteinases and other proteins (2007) J.

Experimental results showed increased expression of gusA gene in rice tissue when driven by the native Ubi1 promoter when compared to the use of corn Ubi1 promoter. Results further indicated that the cis-regulatory elements present in the native promoter element might have been responsible for high expression. However, the gusA gene expression level when driven by the rice GAI promoter was notably lower than both Ubi1 promoters. The present study, thus, for the first time helped to demonstrate that the native Ubi1 promoter is a promising genetic element in transgenic approaches for constitutive expression of any gene in rice tissue. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","β-Glucuronidase; Intron; OsGAI promoter; OsUbi promoter; Promoter characterization; Rice constitutive expression","beta glucuronidase; plant DNA; polyubiquitin; analysis of variance; article; cross breeding; fluorometry; gene expression regulation; genetics; maize; metabolism; molecular cloning; promoter region; rice; Southern blotting; transgenic plant; Western blotting; Analysis of Variance; Blotting, Southern; Blotting, Western; Cloning, Molecular; Crosses, Genetic; DNA, Plant; Fluorometry; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucuronidase; Oryza sativa; Plants, Genetically Modified; Polyubiquitin; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"beta glucuronidase, 9001-45-0; DNA, Plant; Glucuronidase, 3.2.1.31; Polyubiquitin, 120904-94-1",,,,"An, Y.Q., McDowell, J.M., Huang, S., McKinney, E.C., Chambliss, S., Meagher, R.B., Strong, constructive expression of the Arabidopsis ACT2/ACT8 actin subclass in vegetative tissues (1996) Plant J, 10, pp. 107-121; Baszcynski, C.L., Barbour, E., Miki, B., (1997) ALS3 Promoters, , US Patent 5659026; Bhattacharyya, J., (2010) Transfer of Alien Entomocidal Gene(s) In a Commercial Rice Cultivar of India, , Ph.

Screening results were based on LC 50 values against cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), one of the dangerous pests of various crop plants including cotton. Among the isolates, the Bt#BREF24 showed promising results, and upon purification the aphidicidal protein was recognized as a binary toxin. One of the components of this binary toxin was identified by peptide sequencing to be a homolog of Vip2A that has been reported previously in other Bacillus spp. Vip2 belongs to the binary toxin group Vip1-Vip2, and is responsible for the enzymatic activity; and Vip1 is the translocation and receptor binding protein. The two genes encoding the corresponding proteins of the binary toxin, designated as vip2Ae and vip1Ae, were cloned from the Bt#BREF24, sequenced, and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Aphid feeding assay with the recombinant proteins confirmed that these proteins are indeed the two components of the binary toxins, and the presence of both partners is essential for the activity. Aphid specificity of the binary toxin was further verified by ligand blotting experiment, which identified an ~50 kDa receptor in the brush border membrane vesicles of the cotton aphids only, but not in the lepidopteran insects. Our finding holds a promise of its use in future as a candidate gene for developing transgenic crop plants tolerant against sap-sucking insect pests. © 2009 by the Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.","Aphis gossypii; Bacillus thuringiensis; Binary toxin; Heterologous expression; Vegetative insecticidal proteins","binding protein; DNA; peptide; plant toxin; recombinant protein; unclassified drug; vegetative insecticidal protein 1; vegetative insecticidal protein 2; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; aphid; Aphis gossypii; article; Bacillus thuringiensis; bacterial gene; bioassay; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme specificity; Escherichia coli; gene expression; insecticidal activity; LC 50; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein analysis; protein purification; sequence homology; vip1Ae gene; vip2Ae gene; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Aphids; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Pest Control, Biological; Plant Diseases; Aphididae; Aphis gossypii; Bacillus thuringiensis; Escherichia coli; Gossypium hirsutum; Hexapoda","GENBANK: A68321, AAO86513, AY245547, CAB42390, CAF25084, CQ759799, EF442245","DNA, 9007-49-2; Bacterial Proteins; Vip3A protein, Bacillus thuringiensis",,,,"Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K.C., (1995) Short Protocols In Molecular Biology, , 3rd Ed.

Significant variations in lipid contents, ranging from 30% to 58% of their dry biomass were found in liquid culture using various carbon sources. Since, >50% of the total lipid was estimated to be neutral lipid for both the fungal species, predicted biodiesel properties were theoretically calculated based upon the determined fatty acid profiles; and the values were found to be comparable to those of commonly used plant oils for biodiesel production. The two endophytes grew successfully on the combined rice straw and wheat bran as substrate that was degraded by their secretory enzymes including cellulase [1.21-2.51. FPU/g dry substrate (gds)] in solid state fermentation and produced substantial amount of lipid (60.32-84.30. mg/gds).

Jute (Corchorus spp.), the major fibre crop in Indian subcontinent, is one of those recalcitrant plants where in vitro tissue culture has provided a little success, and hence, Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation remains to be a challenging proposition in this crop. In the present work, a system of transgenic hairy roots in Corchorus capsularis L. has been developed through genetic transformation by Agrobacterium rhizogenes harbouring two plasmids, i. e. the natural Ri plasmid and a recombinant binary vector derived from the disarmed Ti plasmid of A. tumefaciens. Our findings indicate that the system is relatively easy to establish and reproducible. Molecular analysis of the independent lines of transgenic hairy roots revealed the transfer of relevant transgenes from both the T-DNA parts into the plant genome, indicating the co-transformation nature of the event. High level expression and activity of the gusA reporter gene advocate that the transgenic hairy root system, thus developed, could be applicable as gene expression system in general and for root functional genomics in particular. Furthermore, these transgenic hairy roots can be used in future as explants for plantlet regeneration to obtain stable transgenic jute plants. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Agrobacterium rhizogenes; Binary vector; Corchorus capsularis; GUS assay; GusA reporter gene; Transgenic hairy root","bacterial DNA; T DNA; T-DNA; article; Corchorus; gene vector; genetic transformation; genetics; growth, development and aging; plant root; Rhizobium; transgenic plant; Corchorus; DNA, Bacterial; Genetic Vectors; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Rhizobium; Transformation, Genetic; Agrobacterium; Agrobacterium rhizogenes; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Corchorus; Corchorus capsularis; Rhizobium",,"DNA, Bacterial; T-DNA",,,,"Banerjee, J., Maiti, M.K., Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance (2010) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 394, pp. 178-183; Baranski, R., Klocke, E., Schumann, G., Green fluorescent protein as an efficient selection marker for Agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated carrot transformation (2006) Plant Cell Rep, 25, pp. 190-197; Bonhomme, V., Laurain-Mattar, D., Fliniaux, M.A., Effects of the rol C gene on hairy root: induction development and tropane alkaloid production by Atropa belladonna (2000) J Nat Prod, 63, pp. 1249-1252; Chilton, M.D., Tepfer, D.A., Petit, A., David, C., Casse-Delbart, F., Tempe, J., Agrobacterium rhizogenes inserts T-DNA into the genomes of the host plant root cells (1982) Nature, 295, pp. 432-434; Crane, C., Wright, E., Dixon, R.A., Wang, Z.Y., Transgenic Medicago truncatula plants obtained from Agrobacterium tumefaciens-transformed roots and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed hairy roots (2006) Planta, 223, pp. 1344-1354; Cui, M., Takayanagi, K., Kamada, H., Nishimura, S., Handa, T., Efficient shoot regeneration from hairy roots of Antirrhinum majus L transformed by the rol type MAT vector system (2001) Plant Cell Rep, 20, pp. 55-59; Gangopadhyay, M., Chakraborty, D., Bhattacharyya, S., Bhattacharya, S., Regeneration of transformed plants from hairy roots of Plumbago indica (2010) Plant Cell Tiss Organ Cult, 102, pp. 109-114; Hamill, J.D., Prescott, A., Martin, C., Assessment of the efficiency of cotransformation of the T-DNA of disarmed binary vectors derived from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the T-DNA of A rhizogenes (1987) Plant Mol Biol, 9, pp. 573-584; Hardegger, M., Sturm, A., Transformation and regeneration of carrot (Daucus carota L.)

In the present study, the transgenic tobacco plants were analyzed further to decipher the detailed physiological and biochemical functions of the OsGLP1 and its associated SOD activity. The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active OsGLP1 showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H 2O 2 upon infection by fungal pathogen (Fusarium solani) and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent (ammonium persulfate), respectively. Histological staining revealed enhanced cross-linking of the cell wall components in the stem tissues of the transgenic plants. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the biopolymer from the stem tissues of the transgenic and untransformed plants revealed differential banding pattern of the spectra corresponding to various functional groups. Our findings demonstrate that the OsGLP1 with its inherent SOD activity is responsible for hyper-accumulation of H 2O 2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Biotic and abiotic stresses; Cross-linking; H 2O 2; OsGLP1; Superoxide dismutase","ammonium derivative; cell membrane protein; germin like protein 1; hydrogen peroxide; persulfate ammonium; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; abiotic stress; article; biotic stress; cell wall; controlled study; cross linking; enzyme activity; Fusarium solani; gene expression; histology; infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; plant stem; priority journal; reinforcement; rice; staining; tobacco; transgenic plant; Cell Wall; Fusarium; Glycoproteins; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oryza sativa; Oxidative Stress; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Superoxide Dismutase; Tobacco; Fusarium solani; Nicotiana obtusifolia; Nicotiana tabacum",,"hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; persulfate ammonium, 7727-54-0; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1; Glycoproteins; Hydrogen Peroxide, 7722-84-1; Plant Proteins; Superoxide Dismutase, 1.15.1.1; germin, 123339-15-1",,,,"Dunwell, J.M., Gibbings, J.G., Mahmood, T., Naqvi, S.M.S., Germin and germin-like proteins: evolution structure and function (2008) Crit.

The mature polypeptides deduced from the cDNAs showed sequence identity with the FatB class of plant thioesterases. Southern hybridization revealed the presence of at least four copies of BjFatB gene in the genome of this amphidiploid species. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that the BjFatB class thioesterase is expressed poorly in flowers and leaves, but significantly in seeds at the mid-maturation stage. The enzymatic activities of different BjFatB isoforms were established upon heterologous expression of the four BjFatB CDSs in Escherichia coli K27fadD88, a mutant strain of fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. The substrate specificity of each BjFatB isoform was determined in vivo by fatty acid profile analyses of the culture supernatant and membrane lipid of the recombinant K27fadD88 and E. coli DH10B (fadD +) clones, respectively. The BjFatB1 and BjFatB3 were predominantly active on C18:0-ACP substrate, whereas BjFatB2 and BjFatB4 were specific towards C18:0-ACP as well as C16:0-ACP. These novel FatB genes may find potential application in metabolic engineering of crop plants through their over-expression in seed tissues to generate stearate-rich vegetable fats/oils of commercial importance. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Brassica juncea; FatB class thioesterases; Fatty acid profile; Heterologous expression in E. coli; Substrate specificity","Brassica juncea; Escherichia coli; acyl carrier protein; complementary DNA; isoprotein; plant DNA; thiol ester hydrolase; vegetable protein; article; Brassica; classification; enzyme specificity; enzymology; Escherichia coli; gene expression; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular cloning; multigene family; plant gene; plant genome; plant morphology; plant seed; Southern blotting; Western blotting; Acyl Carrier Protein; Blotting, Southern; Blotting, Western; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Genes, Plant; Genome, Plant; Multigene Family; Mustard Plant; Plant Proteins; Plant Structures; Protein Isoforms; Seeds; Substrate Specificity; Thiolester Hydrolases",,"thiol ester hydrolase, 58943-36-5; Acyl Carrier Protein; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Plant Proteins; Protein Isoforms; Thiolester Hydrolases, 3.1.2.-",,,,"Bao, X., Pollard, M., Ohlrogge, J., The biosynthesis of erucic acid in developing embryos of Brassica rapa (1998) Plant Physiol., 118, pp. 183-190; Dehesh, K., Jones, A., Knutzon, D.S., Volelker, T.A., Production of high levels of 8:0 and 10:0 fatty acids in transgenic canola by over expression of ChFatB2, a thioesterase cDNA from Cuphea hookeriana (1996) Plant J., 9, pp. 167-172; Dörmann, P., Voelker, T.A., Ohlrogge, J.B., Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a novel thioesterase from Arabidopsis thaliana specific for long-chain acyl-acyl carrier proteins (1995) Arch.

The frequency of shoot regeneration and the number of adventitious buds produced from regenerated shoots depend significantly on explant age, thickness of the tTCL sections, and the phytohormones supplemented to the culture medium. A combination of 6-benzyladenine (2.0 mg l-1) and α-naphthaleneacetic acid (0.5 mg l-1) was found to be the best phytohormone combination for shoot bud induction, with the maximum number of shoots obtained when the tTCL sections were 0.5-1.0 mm thick and derived from 4- to 6-week-old seedlings of sesame.

Usually, the single copy OsGLP1 gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues. The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26 nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant. Structural homology modeling predicted a superoxide dismutase (SOD) domain in OsGLP1 protein which upon over-expression in transgenic tobacco plant clearly documented SOD activity. Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Approximately 90% of the commercially cultivated rice hybrids have been derived through three-line breeding involving the use of WA-CMS lines. It is believed that during the 21stcentury, hybrid rice technology will make significant contributions to ensure global food security. This study examined the poorly understood molecular basis of the WA-CMS system in rice.Results: RFLPs were detected for atp6 and orfB genes in sterile and fertile rice lines, with one copy of each in the mt-genome. The RNA profile was identical in both lines for atp6, but an additional longer orfB transcript was identified in sterile lines. 5' RACE analysis of the long orfB transcript revealed it was 370 bp longer than the normal transcript, with no indication it was chimeric when compared to the genomic DNA sequence. cDNA clones of the longer orfB transcript in sterile lines were sequenced and the transcript was determined unedited. Sterile lines were crossed with the restorer and maintainer lines, and fertile and sterile F1hybrids were respectively generated. Both hybrids contained two types of orfB transcripts. However, the long transcript underwent editing in the fertile F1hybrids and remained unedited in the sterile lines. Additionally, the editing of the 1.1 kb orfB transcript co-segregated with fertility restoring alleles in a segregating population of F2progeny; and the presence of unedited long orfB transcripts was detected in the sterile plants from the F2segregating population.Conclusion: This study helped to assign plausible operative factors responsible for male-sterility in the WA cytoplasm of rice. A new point of departure to dissect the mechanisms governing the CMS-WA system in rice has been identified, which can be applied to further harness the opportunities afforded by hybrid vigor in rice. © 2010 Das et al;

Additional biotechnological strategies need to be in place to safeguard the possibility for yield loss of Bt crop by other lepidopteran insects that are insensitive to the Cry1A toxin, and also against the possibility for emergence of resistant insects. In this respect, Cry2A toxin has figured as a prospective candidate to be the second toxin to offer the required protection along with Cry1A. In the present study, the entomocidal potency of Cry2A toxin was enhanced through knowledge-based protein engineering of the toxin molecule. Deletion of 42 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of the peptide followed by the replacement of Lys residues by nonpolar amino acids in the putative transmembrane region including the introduction of Pro resulted in a 4.1-6.6-fold increase in the toxicity of the peptide against three major lepidopteran insect pests of crop plants. © The Author 2007.

Although, the content of palmitate has been observed to be higher than that of stearate at the initial stages of seed development, it goes down when the stearate and oleate contents consistently rise till maturity. The present study was undertaken in order to identify the kind of acyl-ACP thioesterase(s) that drives the characteristic composition of signature fatty acids (oleate 37%, palmitate 25%, stearate 23%, linoleate 12.5%) in its seed oil at maturity. The relative Fat activities in the crude protein extracts of the matured seeds towards three thioester substrates (oleoyl-, stearoyl- and palmitoyl-ACP) have been found to be present in the following respective ratio 100:31:8. Upon further purification of the crude extract, the search revealed the presence of two partially purified thioesterases: a long-chain oleoyl preferring house-keeping LC-Fat and a novel stearoyl-oleoyl preferring SO-Fat. The characteristic accumulation of oleate and linoleate in the M. latifolia seed fat is believed to be primarily due to the thioesterase activity of the LC-Fat or MlFatA. On the other hand, the SO-Fat showed almost equal substrate specificity towards stearoyl- and oleoyl-ACP, when its activity towards palmitoyl-ACP compared to stearoyl-ACP was only about 12%. An RT-PCR based technique for cloning of a DNA fragment from the mRNA pool of the developing seed followed by nucleotide sequencing resulted in the identification of a FatB type of thioesterase gene (MlFatB). This gene was found to exist as a single copy in the mother plant genome. Ectopic expression of this MlFatB gene product in E. coli strain fadD88 further proved that it induced a higher level of accumulation of both stearic and oleic acids when compared to the negative control line that did not contain this MlFatB gene. It also indicated that SO-Fat indeed is the product of the MlFatB gene present in the maturing seeds of M. latifolia in nature. Additionally, a predicted 3D-structure for MlFatB protein has been developed through use of bioinformatics tools. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the structural and functional organization of the ACPs in bacteria and plant are highly conserved, the individual ACP is engaged in the generation of sets of signature fatty acids required for specific purpose in bacterial cells and plant tissues. Realizing the fact that the bacterial ACP being originated early in molecular evolution is characteristically different from the plant's counterpart, we explored the property of an ACP from Azospirillum brasilense (Ab), a plant-associative aerobic bacterium, to find its role in changing the fatty acid profile in heterologous systems. Functional expression of Ab-ACP in Escherichia coli, an enteric bacterium, and Brassica juncea, an oil-seed crop plant, altered the fatty acid composition having predominantly 18-carbon acyl pool, reflecting the intrinsic nature of the ACP from A. brasilense which usually has C18:1 rich membrane lipid. In transgenic Brassica the prime increment was found for C18:3 in leaves; and C18:1 and C8:2 in seeds. Interestingly, the seed oil quality of the transgenic Brassica potentially improved for edible purposes, particularly with respect to the enhancement in the ratio of monounsaturated (C18:1)/saturated fatty acids, increment in the ratio of linoleic (C18:2)/linolenic (C18:3) and reduction of erucic acid (C22:1). © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA corresponding to the mature polypeptide showed 30-40% and 60-75% identity to the reported FatA and FatB class of plant thioesterases, respectively. This gene, MbFatB, is present as a single copy in M. butyracea genome and the MbFatB protein was detected clearly in seed tissues of this plant but not in that of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). Heterologous expression of the MbFatB gene driven by different promoters in E. coli wild type and fatty acid β-oxidation mutant (fadD88) strains resulted production of the recombinant protein with various fusion tags either as biologically inactive (insoluble) or functionally active forms. Expression of functionally active recombinant MbFatB in E. coli affected bacterial growth and cell morphology as well as changed the fatty acid profiles of the membrane lipid and the culture supernatant. Alteration of the fatty acid composition was directed predominantly towards palmitate and to a lesser extent myristate and oleate due to acyl chain termination activity of plant thioesterase in bacteria. Thus, this new MbFatB gene isolated from a non-traditional oil-seed tree can be used in future for transgenic development of oil-seed Brassica, a widely cultivated crop that expresses predominantly oleoyl-ACP thioesterase (FatA) in its seed tissue and has high amount of unwanted erucic acid in edible oil in order to alter the fatty acid profile in a desirable way. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the lipid content per seed kernel increased from 2.5 mg (1.85%, w/w) at 45 DAF to 525 mg (37.5%, w/w) at 93 DAF, the composition of major fatty acids in the lipid did not change appreciably from the early (palmiate, 54%; oleate, 22%; stearate, 2.5% and linoleate, 13%) to the mature stage (palmitate, 66%; oleate, 27.5%; stearate, 2.5% and linoleate, 3%), indicating high content of palmitate in its seed fat (local name Phulwara fat). To investigate the possible role of any palmitoyl specific fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase (FAT) that could be responsible for the accumulation of this unique high-palmitate fat in its seed, FAT activities in the extracts of developing seed kernels (as well as that of young leaves and flower buds) were analyzed. In addition to housekeeping oleoyl preferring LC-FAT (apparent pI, 8.2), a novel FAT showing almost equal substrate specificity for palmitoyl-and oleoyl-ACP, which we termed as PO-FAT, was found at high levels in seed kernels and to a smaller extent in leaves and flower buds. The enzyme (PO-FAT) was purified and biochemically characterized. The relative rate of substrate (at 2 μM) hydrolysis by the purified enzyme was 100:90:30:7 for palmitoyl-, oleoyl-, stearoyl- and lauroyl-ACP, respectively, and the Vmax/Km ratios for the first three substrates were 100: 73: 47, respectively. The enzyme was found to be a heat-stable basic protein (apparent pI, 9.7) showing its optimum activity at pH 9.0.It is highly probable that the enzyme PO-FAT plays a pivotal role in determining the fatty acid composition of the palmitate-rich Phulwara fat in developing seeds of the plant. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry studies indicated a molecular weight of 28,767 Da. Using steady-state kinetics studies, the purified enzyme exhibited a K(m) of 660 ± 100 μM and a k(cat) of 484 ± 92 s-1 at 37°C. Metal analyses demonstrated that the enzyme binds 2.1 ± 0.5 moles of Zn(II) per monomer; the binding of Zn(II) is essential for enzyme viability and activity. Sequence comparison of glyoxalase II enzymes from human, A. thaliana, and yeast and the metallo-β-lactamases reveal that all metal binding ligands of the metallo-β-lactamases are conserved in glyoxalase II enzymes, suggesting that all glyoxalase II enzymes are Zn(II) metalloenzymes. These results and their implications are discussed in light of previous studies on glyoxalase II, and an active site for the glyoxalase II enzymes is proposed.","Arabidoposis thaliana; Glyoxalase II; Zn(II)","hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase; hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase; thiol ester hydrolase; zinc; arabidopsis; article; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme purification; mass spectrometry; molecular weight; plant; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; chemistry; enzyme activation; enzymology; genetics; human; metabolism; molecular genetics; sequence alignment; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Enzyme Activation; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Alignment; Thiolester Hydrolases; Zinc",,"hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, 9025-90-5; hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, EC 3.1.2.6; Thiolester Hydrolases, EC 3.1.2.-; Zinc, 7440-66-6",,,,"Thornalley, P.J., Greskowiak, M., Della Bianca, V., (1990) Med.

In addition to its role in the detoxification of cytotoxic 2-oxo-aldehydes specifically methylglyoxal, it has been suggested that the glyoxalase system may also play a role in controlling cell differentiation and proliferation. During the analysis of a T-DNA-tagged mutant of Arabidopsis we identified the gene for a glyoxalase II isozyme (GLY1) that appears to be mitochondrially localized. The cDNA encoding a glyoxalase II cytoplasmic isozyme (GLY2) was also isolated and characterized. Southern blot and sequence analyses indicate that glyoxalase II proteins are encoded by at least two multigene families in Arabidopsis. Escherichia coli cells expressing either GLY1 or GLY2 exhibit increased glyoxalase II activity, confirming that they do, in fact, encode glyoxalase II proteins. Northern analysis shows that the two genes are differentially expressed. Transcripts for the mitochondrial isozyme are most abundant in roots, while those for the cytoplasmic isozyme are highest in flower buds. The identification of glyoxalase II isozymes that are differentially expressed suggests that they may play different roles in the cell.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Glyoxalase II; Methylglyoxal; T-DNA","complementary DNA; hybrid protein; hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase; isoenzyme; messenger RNA; plant DNA; plant RNA; thiol ester hydrolase; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; DNA sequence; enzymology; Escherichia coli; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrion; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; multigene family; nucleotide sequence; physiology; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Isoenzymes; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Thiolester Hydrolases; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Escherichia coli","GENBANK: U90927, U90928, U90929","DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, EC 3.1.2.6; Isoenzymes; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Thiolester Hydrolases, EC 3.1.2.-",,,,"Allen, R., Lo, T., Thornalley, P.J., Inhibitors of glyoxalase I: Design, synthesis, inhibitory characteristics and biological evaluation (1993) Biochem Soc Trans, 21, pp. 535-540; Allen, R., Lo, T., Thornalley, P., Purification and characterization of glyoxalase II from human red blood cells (1993) Eur J Biochem, 213, pp. 1261-1267; Ball, J., Vander Jagt, D., S-2-hydroxyacylgluthathione hydrolase (glyoxalase II): Active site mapping of a nonserine thiolesterase (1981) Biochemistry, 20, pp. 899-905; Concha, N., Rasmussen, B., Bush, K., Herzberg, O., Crystal structure of the wide-spectrum binuclear zinc B-lactamase from Bacteroides fragilis (1996) Structure, 4, pp. 823-836; Deswal, R., Chakaravarty, T., Sopory, S., The glyoxalase system of higher plants: Regulation in growth and differientation (1993) Biochem Soc Trans, 21, pp. 527-530; Doyle, J., Doyle, J., Isolation of plant DNA from fresh tissue (1990) BRL Focus, 12, pp. 13-15; Espartero, J., Sanchez-Aguayo, I., Pardo, J., Molecular characterization of glyoxalase-I from a higher plant; upregulation by stress (1995) Plant Mol Biol, 29, pp. 1223-1233; Feldmann, K.A., T-DNA Insertion Mutagenesis in Arabidopsis: Mutational Spectrum (1991) Plant J, 1, pp. 71-82; Henikoff, S., Unidirectional digestion with exonuclease III creates targeted breakpoints for DNA sequencing (1984) Gene, 28, pp. 351-359; Laemmli, E.K., Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4 (1970) Nature, 227, pp. 680-685; Lo, T., Westwood, M., McLellan, A., Selwood, T., Thornalley, P., Binding and modification of proteins by methylglyoxal under physiological conditions: A kinetic and mechanistic study with N-acetylarginine, N-acetylcysteine, and N-acetyl-lysine and bovine serum albumin (1994) J Biol Chem, 269, pp. 32299-32305; Lyles, G., Chalmers, J., The metabolism of aminoacetone to methylglyoxal by semicarbazide-sensitive amino oxidase in human umbilical artery (1992) Biochem Pharmacol, 43, pp. 1409-1414; Makaroff, C.A., Palmer, J.D., Extensive mitochondrial specific transcription of the Brassica campestris mitochondrial genome (1987) Nucl Acids Res, 15, pp. 5141-5156; Nakai, K., Kanehisa, M., A knowledge base for predicting protein localization sites in eukaryotic cells (1992) Genomics, 14, pp. 897-911; Norton, S., Elia, A., Chyan, M., Gillis, G., Frenzel, C., Principato, G., Inhibitors and inhibition studies of mammalian glyoxalase II activity (1990) Biochem Soc Trans, 21, pp. 545-549; Nortron, S.J., Talesa, V., Yuan, W.-J., Principato, G.B., Glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II from Aloe vera: Purification, characterization and comparison with animal glyoxalases (1990) Biochem Int, 22, pp. 411-418; (1995) pET System Manual, , Novagen, Madison WI; Papoulis, A., Al-Abed, Y., Bucala, R., Identification of N2-(1-carboxyethyl)guanine (CEG) as a guanine advanced glycosylation endproduct (1995) Biochemistry, 34, pp. 648-655; Paulus, C., Knollner, B., Jacobsen, H., Physiological and biochemical characterization of glyoxalase I, a general marker for cell proliferation, from a soybean cell suspension (1993) Planta, 189, pp. 561-566; Peirson, B.N., Owen, H.A., Feldmann, K.A., Makaroff, C.A., Characterization of three male-sterile mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibiting alterations in meiosis (1996) Sex Plant Reprod, 9, pp. 1-16; Phillips, S., Thornalley, P., The formation of methyl glyoxal from triose phosphates.

Cloning genes encoding ACPs from Gram-negative bacteria in Escherichia coli is difficult due to adverse effects of the cloned gene on host cell viability, and we were unsuccessful in cloning the full length ACP gene (acpP) from Azospirillum brasilense using conventional methods. Therefore, ACP from A. brasilense was purified to homogeneity and a part of the acpP gene was cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with two primers, one designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified ACP and the other from the highly conserved amino acid sequence of bacterial ACPs. The nucleotide sequence of the gene was obtained by cloning and sequencing inverse PCR products containing the acpP region generated by two oppositely oriented internal primers designed from the partial acpP gene sequence using restriction-enzyme-digested, self-circularized chromosomal DNA fragments as templates. Characterization of the purified ACP and analysis of the derived amino acid sequence of the acpP gene of A. brasilense revealed that: (a) the mature ACP, composed of 78 amino acids, is a highly expressed protein (about 2.0-3.0 x 10 4 molecules per cell), (b) compared to E. coli ACP, it has a more compact structure and contains significantly more hydrophobic amino acid residues and (c) the potential mRNA sequence of the ACP gene has some structural features typical of a stable mRNA.","acpP; Acyl carrier protein; Azospirillum brasilense; Inverse PCR cloning; Reverse genetics","acyl carrier protein; bacterial protein; messenger rna; primer dna; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; article; azospirillum brasilense; bacterial gene; gene sequence; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; protein purification; rna sequence; sequence homology; Acyl Carrier Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Azospirillum brasilense; Base Sequence; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Cloning, Molecular; DNA Primers; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Escherichia coli; Genes, Bacterial; Genomic Library; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Azospirillum brasilense; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Negibacteria","GENBANK: X82399","Acyl Carrier Protein; DNA Primers; Recombinant Proteins",,,,"Beyreuther, K., Bohmer, H., Dimroth, P., Amino-acid sequence of citrate-lyase acyl-carrier protein from Klebsiella aerogenes (1978) Eur J Biochem, 87, pp. 101-110; Bradford, M.M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding (1976) Anal Biochem, 72, pp. 248-254; Chattopadhyay, S., Mukherjee, A., Ghosh, S., Molecular cloning and sequencing of an operon, carRS of Azospirillum brasilense that codes for a novel two-component regulatory system: Demonstration of a positive regulatory role of carR for global control of carbohydrate catabolism (1994) J Bacteriol, 176, pp. 7484-7490; Cooper, C.L., Boyce, S.G., Lueking, D.R., Purification and characterization of Rhodobacter sphaeroides acyl carrier protein (1987) Biochemistry, 26, pp. 2740-2746; Froehlich, J.E., Poorman, R., Reardon, E., Barnum, S.R., Jaworski, G.J., Purification and characterization of acyl carrier protein from two cyanobacteria species (1990) Eur J Biochem, 193, pp. 817-825; Geiger, O., Spaink, H.P., Kennedy, E.P., Isolation of the Rhizobium leguminosarum NodF nodulation protein: NodF carries a phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (1991) J Bacteriol, 173, pp. 2872-2878; Higgins, C.F., Stability and degradation of mRNA (1991) Curr Opin Cell Biol, 3, pp. 1013-1018; Hirel, P.-H., Schmitter, J.M., Dissen, P., Fayat, G., Blanquet, S., Extent of N-terminal methionine excision from E. coli protein is governed by the side chain length of the penultimate amino acid (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 86, pp. 8247-8251; Innis, M.A., Gelfand, D.H., Sninsky, J.J., White, T.J., (1990) PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications, , New York: Academic Press; Jackowski, S., Rock, C.O., Ratio of active to inactive forms of acyl carrier protein in Escberichia coli (1983) J Biol Chem, 258, pp. 15186-15191; Kawakami, Y., Ohmori, S., Microidentification of N-terminal blocked amino acid residues of proteins and peptides (1994) Anal Biochem, 320, pp. 66-72; Laemmli, U.K., Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4 (1970) Nature, 227, pp. 680-685; Magnuson, K., Jackowski, S., Rock, C.O., Cronan Jr., J.E., Regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli (1993) Microbiol Rev, 57, pp. 522-542; Marmur, J., A procedure for the isolation of DNA from microorganisms (1961) J Mol Biol, 3, pp. 208-218; Matsudaira, P., Sequence from picomole quantities of proteins electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (1987) J Biol Chem, 262, pp. 10035-10038; Mukherjee, A., Ghosh, S., Regulation of fructose uptake and catabolism by succinate in Azospirillum brasilense (1987) J Bacteriol, 169, pp. 4361-4367; Nakamura, K., Pirtle, R.M., Pirtle, I.L., Takeishi, K., Inouye, M., Messenger ribonucleic acid of the lipoprotein of the Escherichia coli outer membrane.
