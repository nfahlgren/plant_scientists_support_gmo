These include two drought-tolerant and four drought-sensitive genotypes, having different root morphology either during optimal or water-deficit stress conditions. After a two-week-long water withdrawal, no significant changes were detected in root weights but various trends were observed in the cultivars. These tendencies showed relevant correlations with expression kinetics of genes encoding proteins related to root growth and development. On the other hand, probes indicating variation in distinct genotypes mainly belonged to the group of stress-related genes which encode proteins that contribute to carbohydrate remodeling, osmoprotectant accumulation, amino acid metabolism, defense against oxidative stress, and regulation of transcription. Hence, these data allow us to focus on major metabolic processes involved in drought adaptation as well as provide a wide selection of candidate genes for further detailed studies.","drought; oligonucleotide-microarray; root; transcriptome changes; wheat",,,,,,,"Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) J. of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Caraux, G., Pinloche, S., PermutMatrix: A graphical environment to arrange gene expression profiles in optimal linear order (2005) Bioinformatics, 21 (7), pp. 1280-1281. , DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti141; Coram, T.E., Brown-Guedira, G., Chen, X.M., Using transcriptomics to understand the wheat genome (2008) CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources, 3. , 083; Edwards, D., Batley, J., Snowdon, R.J., Accessing complex crop genomes with next-generation sequencing (2013) Theor.

The goal of this study was to construct and analyze a catalogue of all statistically relevant putative functional octamer words or motifs (which we have termed the ""motifome"" of a given organism) found within first introns, promoters, the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), and the entire genome of japonica rice, and compare them to results attained from a previous analysis performed on the Arabidopsis genome. We found a number of novel motifs in different sets of non-coding rice sequence sets. The diversity of motifs in rice was higher in Arabidopsis, implicating a higher mutation turnover. While common motifs were found between the two species, motif pairs were missing, showing the difference between the regulatory machinery between rice and Arabidopsis. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"octamer transcription factor; Arabidopsis; article; functional genomics; intron; mutation; nonhuman; plant genome; priority journal; promoter region; protein motif; rice; RNA sequence; turnover time; untranslated region; Genes, Plant; Oryza sativa; Untranslated Regions",,"Untranslated Regions",,,,"Bernard, V., Brunaud, V., Lecharny, A., TC-motifs at the TATA-box expected position in plant genes: A novel class of motifs involved in the transcription regulation (2010) BMC Genomics, 11, p. 166; Brown, R.L., Kazan, K., McGrath, K.C., Maclean, D.J., Manners, J.M., A role for the GCC-box in jasmonate-mediated activation of the PDF1.2 gene of Arabidopsis (2003) Plant Physiology, 132 (2), pp. 1020-1032. , DOI 10.1104/pp.102.017814; Goren, A., Kim, E., Amit, M., Vaknin, K., Kfir, N., Ram, O., Ast, G., Overlapping splicing regulatory motifs-combinatorial effects on splicing (2010) Nucleic Acids, 38, pp. 3318-3327; Hagen, G., Guilfoyle, T., Auxin-responsive gene expression: Genes, promoters and regulatory factors (2003) Plant Mol Biol, 49, pp. 373-385; Jung, K.H., Dardick, C., Bartley, L.E., Refinement of light-responsive transcript lists using rice oligonucleotide arrays: Evaluation of gene-redundancy (2008) PLoS One, 3, pp. e3337; Lichtenberg, J., Jacox, E., Welch, J.D., Word-based characterization of promoters involved in human DNA repair pathways (2009) BMC Genomics, 10 (SUPPL. 1), pp. S18; Lichtenberg, J., Yilmaz, A., Welch, J.D., The word landscape of the non-coding segments of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (2009) BMC Genomics, 10, p. 463; Logemann, E., Parniske, M., Hahlbrock, K., Modes of expression and common structural features of the complete phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene family in parsley (1995) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 92, pp. 5905-5909; Morris, R.T., O'Connor, T.R., Wyrick, J.J., Osiris: An integrated promoter database for Oryza sativa L (2008) Bioinformatics, 24, pp. 2915-2917; Ohno, S., (1970) Evolution by Gene Duplication, , Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag; Ouyang, S., Zhu, W., Hamilton, J., Lin, H., Campbell, M., Childs, K., Thibaud-Nissen, F., Buell, R.C., The TIGR Rice Genome Annotation Resource: Improvements and new features (2007) Nucleic Acids Research, 35 (SUPPL. 1), pp. D883-D887. , DOI 10.1093/nar/gkl976; Park, H.C., Kim, M.L., Kang, Y.H., Pathogen- and NaCl-induced expression of the SCaM-4 promoter is mediated in part by a GT-1 box that interacts with a GT-1-like transcription factor (2004) Plant Physiol, 135, pp. 2150-2161; Pavlidis, P., Stafford, N.W., Matrix2png: A utility for visualizing matrix data (2003) Bioinformatics, 19 (2), pp. 295-296. , DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.295; Sandhu, J.S., Webster, C.I., Gray, J.C., A/T-rich sequences act as quantitative enhancers of gene expression in transgenic tobacco and potato plants (1998) Plant Molecular Biology, 37 (5), pp. 885-896. , DOI 10.1023/A:1006051832213; Sandve, G.K., Drabløs, F., A survey of motif discovery methods in an integrated framework (2006) Biol Direct, 1, p. 11; Tang, W., Perry, S.E., Binding site selection for the plant MADS domain protein AGL15.

Plainsman V, a drought tolerant; and Cappelle Desprez, a drought sensitive wheat cultivar were subjected gradually to osmotic stress using polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) reaching 400mOsm on the 11th day. Compared to controls cv. Plainsman Vmaintained the root growth and relative water content of root tissues, while these parameters were decreased in the drought sensitive cv. Cappelle Desprez under PEG-mediated osmotic stress. Simultaneously, H2O2 content in 1-cm-long apical segment of roots comprising the proliferation and elongation zone, showed a transient increase in cv. Plainsman V and a permanent raise in cv. Cappelle Desprez. Measurements of the transcript levels of selected class III peroxidase (TaPrx) coding sequences revealed significant differences between the two cultivars on the 9th day, two days after applying 100 mOsm PEG. The abundance of TaPrx04 transcript was enhanced transitionally in the root apex of cv. Plainsman V but decreased in cv. Cappelle Desprez under osmotic stress while the expression of TaPrx01, TaPrx03, TaPrx19, TaPrx68, TaPrx107 and TaPrx109-C decreased to different extents in both cultivars. After a transient decrease, activities of soluble peroxidase fractions of crude protein extracts rose in both cultivars on day 11, but the activities of cell wall-bound fractions increased only in cv. Cappelle Desprez under osmotic stress. Parallel with high H2O2 content of the tissues, certain isoenzymes of covalently bound fraction in cv. Cappelle Desprez showed increased activity suggesting that they may limit the extension of root cell walls in this cultivar. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Activity of peroxidase fractions; Hydrogen peroxide; In-gel activity of peroxidase isoenzymes; Peroxidase expression; Real-time qPCR; Root length; Triticum aestivum L","guaiacol peroxidase; hydrogen peroxide; isoenzyme; macrogol derivative; peroxidase; plant RNA; vegetable protein; water; article; cell wall; drought; enzymology; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; osmosis; phylogeny; physiological stress; physiology; plant root; real time polymerase chain reaction; seedling; time; wheat; Cell Wall; Droughts; Hydrogen Peroxide; Isoenzymes; Osmosis; Peroxidase; Peroxidases; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Polyethylene Glycols; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Plant; Seedling; Stress, Physiological; Time Factors; Triticum; Water; Triticum aestivum",,"hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; peroxidase, 9003-99-0; water, 7732-18-5; Hydrogen Peroxide, 7722-84-1; Isoenzymes; Peroxidase, 1.11.1.7; Peroxidases, 1.11.1.-; Plant Proteins; Polyethylene Glycols; RNA, Plant; Water, 7732-18-5; guaiacol peroxidase, 1.11.1.-",,,,"Mittler, R., Vanderauwera, S., Gollery, M., Van Breusegem, F., Reactive oxygen gene network of plants (2004) Trends Plant Sci., 9, pp. 490-498; Cheeseman, J.M., Hydrogen peroxide and plant stress: a challenging relationship (2007) Plant Stress, 1, pp. 4-15; Tari, I., Csiszar, J., Effects of NO2- or NO3- supply on polyamine accumulation and ethylene production of wheat roots at acidic and neutral pH: implications for root growth (2003) Plant Growth Regul., 40, pp. 121-128; De Gara, L., Class III peroxidases and ascorbate metabolism in plants (2004) Phytochem.

The hyperosmolarity of the nutrient solution increased the GST activity and the transcript amount of the selected tau group GSTs in the drought tolerant Kobomugi and moderately drought tolerant GK Öthalom cultivars. The role of abscisic acid in the regulation of GST expression was examined by the inhibition of ABA biosynthesis pathway with fluridone.

It is of great agricultural importance to know which genes are affected during stress response. The genome sequence of a number of plant species has been determined, among them Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa, whose genome has been annotated most completely as of yet, and are well-known organisms widely used as experimental systems. This paper applies a statistical algorithm for predicting new stress-induced motifs and genes by analyzing promoter sets co-regulated by abiotic stress in the previously mentioned two species. After identifying characteristic putative regulatory motif sequence pairs (dyads) in the promoters of 125 stress-regulated Arabidopsis genes and 87 O. sativa genes, these dyads were used to screen the entire Arabidopsis and O. sativa promoteromes to find related stress-induced genes whose promoters contained a large number of these dyads found by our algorithm. We were able to predict a number of putative dyads, characteristic of a large number of stress-regulated genes, some of them newly discovered by our algorithm and serve as putative transcription factor binding sites. Our new motif prediction algorithm comes complete with a stand-alone program. This algorithm may be used in motif discovery in the future in other species. The more than 1,200 Arabidopsis and 1,700 Orzya sativa genes found by our algorithm are good candidates for further experimental studies in abiotic stress. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Abiotic stress; Arabidopsis thaliana;

Plainsman V and landrace Kobomugi) were identified during adaptation to moderate water stress at the tillering stage. Differences in organ sizes, water-use efficiency and seed production were detected in plants grown in soil, and root functions were characterised by expression profiling. The molecular genetic background of the behaviour of the two genotypes during this stress was revealed using a cDNA macroarray for transcript profiling of the roots. During a 4-week period of moderate water deficit, a set of up-regulated genes displaying transiently increased expression was identified in young plantlets, mostly in the second week in the roots of Kobomugi, while transcript levels remained constantly high in roots of Plainsman V. These genes encode proteins with various functions, such as transport, protein metabolism, osmoprotectant biosynthesis, cell wall biogenesis and detoxification, and also regulatory proteins. Oxidoreductases, peroxidases and cell wall-related genes were induced significantly only in Plainsman V, while induction of stress- and defence-related genes was more pronounced in Kobomugi. Real-time qPCR analysis of selected members of the glutathione S-transferase gene family revealed differences in regulation of family members in the two genotypes and confirmed the macroarray results. The TaGSTZ gene was stress-activated only in the roots of Kobomugi. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Drought tolerance; Glutathione S-transferase; Macroarray; Real-time qPCR; Tillering stage; Triticum aestivum L","plant RNA; water; article; cluster analysis; DNA microarray; drought; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; genotype; physiology; plant root; wheat; Cluster Analysis; Droughts; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genotype; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plant Roots; RNA, Plant; Triticum; Water",,"water, 7732-18-5; RNA, Plant; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Aprile, A., Mastrangelo, A.M., De Leonardis, A.M., Galiba, G., Roncaglia, E., Ferrari, F., De Bellis, L., Cattivelli, L., Transcriptional profiling in response to terminal drought stress reveals differential responses along the wheat genome (2009) BMC Genomics, 10, p. 279; Blum, A., Drought resistance, water-use efficiency, and yield potential - are they compatible, dissonant, or mutually exclusive?

MV Emese and cv. Plainsman (drought tolerant) and cv. GK Élet and Cappelle Desprez (drought-sensitive) flag leaves under control and drought stress conditions during the grain-filling period, in order to reveal possible roles of different GST classes in the senescence of flag leaves. Six wheat GSTs, members of 3 GST classes, were selected and their regulation by drought and senescence was investigated. High GPOX activity (EC 1.11.1.9) was observed in well-watered controls of the drought-tolerant Plainsman cultivar. At the same time, TaGSTU1B and TaGSTF6 sequences, investigated by real-time PCR, showed high-expression levels that increased with time, indicating that the gene products of these genes may play important roles in monocarpic senescence of wheat. Expression of these genes was also induced by drought stress in all of the four investigated cultivars, but extremely high transcript amounts were detected in cv. Plainsman. Our data indicate genotypic variations of wheat GSTs. Expression levels and early induction of two senescence-associated GSTs under drought during grain filling in flag leaves correlated with high yield stability. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Relative transcript levels of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR) isoenzymes, predicted to localize in distinct subcellular organelles, showed different transcriptional changes in the two genotypes. Among APX coding mRNAs, expression levels of two cytosolic (cAPX I, II) and a thylakoid-bound (tAPX) variants increased significantly in Plainsman V while a cytosolic (cAPX I) and a stromal (sAPX II) APX coding transcripts were found to be higher in Cappelle Desprez after a 4-week-long water-deficit stress. Examining the MDARs, two cytosolic isoforms (cMDAR I, II) displayed significant up-regulation of mRNA levels in the sensitive genotype, whereas only one of them (cMDAR II) did in the tolerant cultivar. We found an up-regulated chloroplastic DHAR (chlDHAR) mRNA only in the sensitive Cappelle Desprez. However, increased expression levels of a cytosolic GR (cGR) and a chloroplastic GR (chlGR) were detected only in the tolerant Plainsman V. After 4 weeks of reduced irrigation, a significantly lower ascorbate/dehydroascorbate ratio was detected in leaves of the sensitive Cappelle Desprez than in the tolerant Plainsman V. Our results indicate that more robust transcription of ascorbate-based detoxification machinery may prevent an adverse shift of the cellular redox balance. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Ascorbate peroxidase;

Plant root is the most important organ for uptake of water, therefore it plays important role in tolerance to osmotic and drought stresses. Plants developing stronger and deeper roots suffer less from water deficit. The aim of our work was to understand and improve the drought stress-tolerance in cereals by analyzing the transcriptional changes in the root system of different rice cultivars under drought stress conditions. According to the results of the DNA chip hybridizations the response of the genes to the drought stress is altered in roots during the day. Further experiments showed that the expression patterns of genes in cultivars with distinct levels of stress tolerance are different, and that may correlate to their stress tolerance.","Drought stress; Microarray; Rice; Root; Transcript profile","abscisic acid; gene product; late embryogenesis abundant protein; messenger RNA; transcriptome; unclassified drug; conference paper; cultivar; DNA hybridization; DNA microarray; down regulation; drought stress; gene cluster; gene expression profiling; genetic transcription; genotype; nonhuman; plant parameters; plant root; plant root weight; plant shoot weight; plant stress; rice; signal transduction; upregulation",,"abscisic acid, 21293-29-8",,,,"Chomczynski, P., Sacchi, N., Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (1987) Anal Biochem, 162, pp. 156-159; Papp I, Mur LA, Dalmadi Á, Dulai S, Koncz Cs (2004) A mutation in the Cap Binding Protein 20 gene confers drought tolerance to Arabidopsis.

Changes in expression patterns, subjected to reduced amount of irrigation solution, of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) as enzyme families of this cycle were studied comparing a drought tolerant (Triticum aestivum cv. Plainsman V) and a drought sensitive (Triticum aestivum cv. Cappelle Desprez) wheat genotype. Relative transcript level of isoenzymes localized in distinct subcellular organelles showed significant differences between the two genotypes at the beginning of treatment. Among APX isoenzymes, a thylakoid-bound (tAPX), two stromal (sAPX1, sAPX2), one of the two cytosolic (cAPX1) and a peroxisomal (mAPX) APXs displayed higher relative transcript level in the drought tolerant genotype. The same was observed in case of cytosolic (cDHAR) and stromal (sDHAR) DHARs. However, relative transcript levels of MDHAR isoenzymes were similar in both genotypes. Under drought conditions, the initial relative transcript levels of distinct isoenzymes changed differently comparing the two genotypes leading to the final conclusion that the drought tolerant genotype up-regulates mostly the cytosolic APXs and MDARs to maintain the cellular ascorbate redox state, however in the drought sensitive genotype, sAPX and sDHAR are induced to fill the same function.","Ascorbate; Drought; Isoenzymes; Oxidative stress; Transcript profile; Wheat","ascorbate glutathione; ascorbate peroxidase; dehydroascorbic acid reductase; glutathione; isoenzyme; monodehydroascorbate reductase; unclassified drug; cell organelle; cellular distribution; conference paper; cytosol; drought stress; drought tolerance; enzyme binding; enzyme localization; genetic transcription; genotype; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; peroxisome; plant defense; protein expression; stroma cell; thylakoid; upregulation; wheat; Triticum aestivum",,"ascorbate peroxidase, 72906-87-7; dehydroascorbic acid reductase, 9036-50-4; glutathione, 70-18-8; monodehydroascorbate reductase, 9029-26-9",,,,"Eltayeb, A.E., Kawano, N., Badawi, G.H., Kaminak, H., Sanekata, T., Shibahara, T., Inanaga, S., Tanaka, K., Overexpression of monodehydroascorbate reductase in transgenic tobacco confers enhanced tolerance to ozone, salt and polyethylene glycol stresses (2007) Planta, 225, pp. 1255-1264; Shao, H.B., Chu, L.Y., Lu, Z.H., Kang, C.M., Primary antioxidant free radical scavenging and redox signaling pathways in higher plant cells (2008) Int J Biol Sci, 4 (1), pp. 8-14; Mittler, R., Vanderauwera, S., Gollery, M., Van Breusegem, F., Reactive oxygen gene network of plants (2004) Trends Plant Sci, 9 (10), pp. 490-498; Panchuk, I.I., Zentgraf, U., Volkov, R.A., Expression of the Apx gene family during leaf senescence of Arabidopsis thaliana (2005) Planta, 222, pp. 926-932; Secenji, M., Lendvai, A., Hajósné, Z., Dudits, D., Györgyey, J., Experimental system for studying long-term drought stress adaptation of wheat cultivars (2005) Acta Biol Szeged, 49 (1-2), pp. 51-52; Teixeira, F.K., Menezes-Benavente, L., Galvao, V.C., Margis, R., Margis-Pinheiro, M., Rice ascorbate peroxidase gene family encodes functionally diverse isoforms localized in different subcellular compartments (2006) Planta, 224, pp. 300-324","Györgyey, J.; Institute of Plant Biology, Biological Research Center, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary; email: arthur@brc.hu",,,,,,,,1588385X,,ABSCC,,"English","Acta Biol.

The GST activities were much higher in the roots than in the shoots and were induced by PEG especially in the roots. The aim of our work was to sort out the osmotic stress related wheat GST genes. The changes in enzyme activities and expression of several GST-coding sequences were in good correlation. Both cultivars responded to osmotic stress.

Genes encoding RBR proteins were identified and characterized in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The alfalfa MsRBR gene encodes a new member of the dicot RBR proteins (subfamily A). A comparison was made of two rice genes, OsRBR1 (subfamily B) and OsRBR2 (subfamily C), which exhibit differences in exon-intron organization and share only 52% amino acid sequence identity. The plant RBR proteins can be categorized into three distinct subfamilies, in which the similarity between members is greater than the similarity to other RBR proteins from the same species. Comparison of the transcript levels in various tissues revealed that the expression of the OsRBR1 gene was high in embryos or cultured cells and gradually decreased from the basal region to the tip of the leaves. The OsRBR2 gene displayed more transcripts in differentiated tissues, such as leaves and roots. In contrast, the mRNA level of the MsRBR gene did not differ significantly in either mature leaves or cultured cells. The results of yeast two-hybrid pairwise interaction assays demonstrated differences between the rice RBR variants in the interactions with the phosphatase 2A B″ regulatory subunit and an unknown protein. The in silico and functional data presented in this work highlight considerable differences between dicot and monocot species in the retinoblastoma regulatory pathways and permit an improved classification of RBR proteins in higher plants. © The Author [2007].

In order to reveal gene expression changes during the establishment of embryogenic competence, we compared the cell types developed in the presence of 1 and 10 μM 2,4-D, respectively, at the time of their first cell divisions (fourth day of culture) using a PCR-based cDNA subtraction approach. Although the subtraction efficiency was relatively low, applying an additional differential screening step allowed the identification of 38 10 μM 2,4-D up-regulated transcripts. The corresponding genes/proteins were annotated and representatives of various functional groups were selected for more detailed gene expression analysis. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) analysis was used to determine relative expression of the selected genes in 2,4-D-treated leaves as well as during the whole process of somatic embryogenesis. Gene expression patterns confirmed 2,4-D inducibility for all but one of the 11 investigated genes as well as for the positive control leafy cotyledon1 (MsLEC1) gene. The characterized genes exhibited differential expression patterns during the early induction phase and the late embryo differentiation phase of somatic embryogenesis. Genes coding for a GST-transferase, a PR10 pathogenesis-related protein, a cell division-related ribosomal (S3a) protein, an ARF-type small GTPase and the nucleosome assembly factor family SET protein exhibited higher relative expression not only during the induction of somatic embryogenesis but at the time of somatic embryo differentiation as well. This may indicate that the expression of these genes is associated with developmental transitions (differentiation as well as de-differentiation) during the process of somatic embryogenesis. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The represented genes could be assigned to various linkage groups by genetic mapping. They were expressed in all investigated plant organs, although at different level. Relative gene expression patterns in response to Sinorhizobium infection of roots as well as during somatic embryogenesis indicated their differential participation in these processes. DNA sequences coding for altogether six different Medicago sp. Rop GTPases could be identified in sequence databases. Based on their homology to each other and to their Arabidopsis counterparts, a unified nomenclature is suggested for Medicago Rop GTPases. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Lack of water affects their biomass, their yield that is the most conspicuous in case of crops causing severe uncertainty of agricultural productivity. Under drought stress, plants generally display many physiological responses such as stomata closure, decreased/stopped photosynthetic activity, increased root/shoot ratio, reduced growth of vegetative parts. Many of the physiological changes are caused by underlying transcriptional alterations of high number of genes in many cases. One of the most studied phenomenon is the accumulation of proline as an osmoprotectant. Proline biosynthesis is increased by water deficit due to increased expression of the key enzyme, namely Δ 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS). In our experiments, we applied P5CS as a positive control to evaluate our new experimental system, which will allow to follow transcriptional changes in shoots, as well as in roots during drought adaptation. Our alternative approach allows greenhouse or growth chamber experiments that are more similar to natural conditions than the widely used experimental systems based on osmotic agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG).","Drought stress; Long-term adaptation; P5CS; Wheat","complementary DNA; macrogol; proline; pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase; RNA; water; adaptation; amino acid synthesis; conference paper; controlled study; cultivar; DNA synthesis; drought stress; genetic transcription; greenhouse; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant root; plant stoma; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; shoot; wheat; Triticum aestivum",,"macrogol, 25322-68-3; proline, 147-85-3, 7005-20-1; pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase, 9029-17-8; RNA, 63231-63-0; water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Chen, T.H.H., Murata, N., Enhancement of tolerance of abiotic stress by metabolic engineering of betaines and other compatible solutes (2002) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 5, pp. 250-257; Chomczynski, P., Sacchi, N., Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (1987) Anal Biochem, 162, pp. 156-159; Gamborg, O.L., Wetter, L.R., (1975) Plant Tissue Culture Methods, , National Research Council of Canada, Saskatoon; Papp, I., Mur, L.A., Dalmadi, Á., Dulai, S., Koncz, C.S., A mutation in the Cap Binding Protein 20 gene confers drought tolerance to Arabidopsis (2004) Plant Mol Biol, 55, pp. 679-686; Wu, Y., Cosgrove, D.J., Adaptation of roots to low water potentials by changes in cell wall extensibility and cell wall proteins (2000) J Exp Bot, 51, pp. 1543-1553; Wang, W., Vinocur, B., Altman, A., Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures: Towards engineering for stress tolerance (2003) Planta, 218, pp. 1-14; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K., Kasuga, M., Liu, Q., Nakashima, K., Sakuma, Y., Abe, H., Shinwari, Z.K., Shinozaki, K., Biological mechanisms of drought stress response (2002) JIRCAS Working Report, pp. 1-8","Györgyey, J.; Institute of Plant Biology, Biological Research Center, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary; email: arthur@brc.hu",,,,,,,,1588385X,,ABSCC,,"English","Acta Biol.

The GST activities of drought-tolerant Triticum aestivum L. cv. Kobomugi and cv. Plainsman were measured after one week 400 mOsm polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. The GST activities were much higher in the root than in the shoot and were induced by PEG especially in root. The aim of our work was to sort out the drought stress related wheat GST genes. Phylogenetic analysis of wheat GSTs was performed in silico and using the tentative consensus sequences a dendogram was composed. According to the conserved sequences used for classification of GST proteins, we could identify six groups of wheat GSTs. The phi GSTs are the most heterologous group, containing 25 sequences. The zeta, theta and tau GSTs are represented by 10, 9 and 8 TCs respectively. There are two other unidentified groups containing 8 and 6 sequences.

Here, we investigated the function and regulation of an alfalfa (Medicago sativa) A2-type cyclin in three distinct root developmental programs: in primary and secondary root development, nodule development, and nematode-elicited gall formation. Using transgenic plants carrying the Medsa;cycA2;2 promoter-β-glucuronidase gene fusion, in combination with other techniques, cycA2;2 expression was localized in meristems and proliferating cells in the lateral root and nodule primordia. Rapid induction of cycA2;2 by Nod factors demonstrated that this gene is implicated in cell cycle activation of differentiated cells developing to nodule primordia. Surprisingly, cycA2;2 was repressed in the endoreduplicating, division-arrested cells both during nodule development and formation of giant cells in nematode-induced galls, indicating that CycA2;2 was dispensable for S-phase in endoreduplication cycles. Overexpression of cycA2;2 in transgenic plants corresponded to wild type protein levels and had no apparent phenotype. In contrast, antisense expression of cycA2;2 halted regeneration of somatic embryos, suggesting a role for CycA2;2 in the formation or activity of apical meristems. Expression of cycA2;2 was up-regulated by auxins, as expected from the presence of auxin response elements in the promoter. Moreover, auxin also affected the spatial expression pattern of this cyclin by shifting the cycA2;2 expression from the phloem to the xylem poles.",,"Cells; Genes; Plants (botany); Proteins; Plant development; Hormones; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Differentiation; Cyclin A; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucuronidase; Indoleacetic Acids; Medicago; Meristem; Mitosis; Molecular Sequence Data; Nematoda; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Tumors; Plants, Genetically Modified; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Seeds; Medicago; Medicago sativa","GENBANK: AY043242","Cyclin A; Glucuronidase, EC 3.2.1.31; Indoleacetic Acids; Plant Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins",,,,"Atanassova, R., Chaubet, N., Gigot, C., A 126 bp fragment of a plant histone gene promoter confers preferential expression in meristems of transgenic Arabidopsis (1992) Plant J, 2, pp. 291-300; Ballas, N., Wong, L.M., Theologis, A., Identification of the auxin-responsive element, AuxRE, in the primary indoleacetic acid-inducible gene, PS-IAA4/5, of pea (Pisum sativum) (1993) J Mol Biol, 233, pp. 580-596; Bauer, P., Crespi, M.D., Szecsi, J., Allison, L.A., Schultze, M., Rater, P., Kondorosi, E., Kondorosi, A., Alfalfa Enod12 genes are differentially regulated during nodule development by Nod factors and Rhizobium invasion (1994) Plant Physiol, 105, pp. 585-592; Boot, K.J.M., Van Brussel, A.A.N., Tak, T., Spaink, H.P., Kijne, J.W., Lipochitin oligosaccharides from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae reduce auxin transport capacity in Vicia sativa ssp. nigra roots (1999) Mol Plant-Microbe Interact, 12, pp. 839-844; Bouchard, C., Staller, P., Eilers, M., Control of cell proliferation by Myc (1998) Trends Cell Biol, 8, pp. 202-206; Burssens, S., De Almeida Engler, J., Beeckman, T., Richard, C., Shaul, O., Ferreira, P., Van Montagu, M., Inzé, D., Developmental expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana cycA2;1 gene (2000) Planta, 211, pp. 623-631; Burssens, S., Himanen, K., Van De Cotte, B., Beeckman, T., Van Montagu, M., Inzé, D., Verbruggen, N., Expression of cell cycle regulatory genes and morphological alterations in response to salt stress in Arabidopsis thaliana (2000) Planta, 211, pp. 632-640; Casimiro, I., Marchant, A., Bhalerao, R.P., Beeckman, T., Dhooge, S., Swarup, R., Graham, N., Casero, P.J., Auxin transport promotes Arabidopsis lateral root initiation (2001) Plant Cell, 13, pp. 843-852; Cebolla, A., Vinardell, J.M., Kiss, E., Olah, B., Roudier, F., Kondorosi, A., Kondorosi, E., The mitotic inhibitor ccs52 is required for endoreduplication and ploidy-dependent cell enlargement in plants (1999) EMBO J, 18, pp. 4476-4484; Chaubet-Gigot, N., Plant A-type cyclins (2000) Plant Mol Biol, 43, pp. 659-675; Chung, S., Parish, R., Studies on the promoter of the Arabidopsis thaliana cdc2a gene (1995) FEBS Lett, 362, pp. 215-219; Coba De La Pena, T., Frugier, F., McKhann, H.I., Bauer, P., Brown, S., Kondorosi, A., Crespi, M., A carbonic anhydrase gene is induced in the nodule primordium and its cell-specific expression is controlled by the presence of Rhizobium during development (1997) Plant J, 11, pp. 407-420; Cockcroft, C.E., Den Boer, B.G., Healy, J.M., Murray, J.A., Cyclin D control of growth rate in plants (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 575-579; Crespl, M.D., Jurkevitch, E., Poiret, M., D'Aubenton-Carafa, Y., Petrovics, G., Kondorosi, E., Kondorosi, A., enod40, a gene expressed during nodule organogenesis, codes for a non-translatable RNA involved in plant growth (1994) EMBO J, 13, pp. 5099-5112; Doerner, P., Jorgensen, J.E., You, R., Steppuhn, J., Lamb, C., Control of root growth and development by cyclin expression (1996) Nature, 380, pp. 520-523; Gatz, C., Frohberg, C., Wendenburg, R., Stringent repression and homogenous de-repression by tetracycline of a modified CaMV 35S promoter in intact transgenic tobacco plants (1992) Plant J, 2, pp. 397-404; Favery, B., Complainville, A., Vinardell, J.M., Lecompte, P., Vaubert, D., Mergaert, P., Kondorosi, A., Abad, P., The endosymbiosis-induced genes enod40 and ccs52A are involved in endoparasitic-nematode interactions in Medicago truncatula (2002) Mol Plant-Microbe Interact, 15, pp. 1008-1013; Foucher, F., Kondorosi, E., Cell cycle regulation in the course of nodule organogenesis (2000) Plant Mol Biol, 43, pp. 773-786; Genschik, P., Criqui, M.C., Parmentier, Y., Derevier, A., Fleck, J., Cell cycle-dependent proteolysis in plants: Identification of the destruction box pathway and metaphase arrest produced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (1998) Plant Cell, 10, pp. 2063-2075; Guilfoyle, T., Hagen, G., Ulmasov, T., Murfett, J., How does auxin turn on genes?

Replacement histone H3 genes are highly and constitutively expressed in all plants. Sequences of the cloned alfalfa histone H3.2 gene MsH3g1 were tested. Constructs of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene were produced with H3.2 gene promoter and intron sequences. Their efficiency was compared with that of the commonly used strong 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in transgenic tobacco plants. Combination of the H3.2 promoter and intron produced significantly higher GUS expression than the strong viral 35S promoter. Histochemical GUS analysis revealed a constitutive pattern of expression. Thus, alfalfa replacement H3 gene sequences can be used instead of viral promoters to drive heterologous gene expression in plants, avoiding perceived risks of viral sequences.","Alfalfa; GUS reporter; Histone H3; Intron; Promoter strength; Transgene","Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Cauliflower mosaic virus; Embryophyta; Medicago sativa; Nicotiana obtusifolia; Nicotiana tabacum; vectors; beta glucuronidase; histone; primer DNA; virus protein; alfalfa; article; Cauliflower mosaic virus; comparative study; gene vector; genetic transformation; genetics; intron; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; promoter region; reporter gene; tobacco; transgenic plant; Base Sequence; Caulimovirus; DNA Primers; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Vectors; Glucuronidase; Histones; Introns; Medicago sativa; Plants, Genetically Modified; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Tobacco; Transformation, Genetic; Viral Proteins",,"DNA Primers; Glucuronidase, EC 3.2.1.31; Histones; Viral Proteins",,,,"Al-Kaff, N.S., Covey, S.N., Kreike, M.M., Page, A.M., Pinder, R., Dale, P.J., Transcriptional and posttranscriptional plant gene silencing in response to a pathogen (1998) Science, 279, pp. 2113-2115; Al-Kaff, N.S., Kreike, M.M., Covey, S.N., Pitcher, R., Page, A.M., Dale, P.J., Plants rendered herbicide-susceptible by cauliflower mosaic virus-elicited suppression of a 35S promoter-regulated transgene (2000) Nat Biotechnol, 18, pp. 995-999; Bevan, M., Binary Agrobacterium vectors for plant transformation (1984) Nucl Acids Res, 12, pp. 8711-8721; Fisher, D.K., Guiltinan, M.J., Rapid, efficient production of homozygous transgenic tobacco plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens: A seed-to-seed protocol (1995) Plant Mol Biol Rep, 13, pp. 278-289; Holsters, M., De Waele, D., Depicker, A., Messens, E., Van Montagu, M., Schell, J., Transfection and transformation of A. tumefaciens (1978) Mol Gen Genet, 163, pp. 181-187; Kapros, T., Stefanov, I., Magyar, Z., Ocsovszky, I., Dudits, D., A short histone H3 promoter from alfalfa specifies expression in S phase cells and meristems (1993) In Vitro Cell Dev Biol, 29, pp. 27-32; Kapros, T., Robertson, A.J., Waterborg, J.H., Histone H3 transcript stability in alfalfa (1995) Plant Mol Biol, 28, pp. 901-914; Kohli, A., Griffiths, S., Palacios, N., Twyman, R.M., Vain, P., Laurie, D.A., Christou, P., Molecular characterization of transforming plasmid rearrangements in transgenic rice reveals a recombination hotspot in the CaMV 35S promoter and confirms the predominance of microhomology mediated recombination (1999) Plant J, 17, pp. 591-601; Marzluff, W.F., Histone gene expression not coupled to DNA synthesis (1989) Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins, pp. 319-329. , Hnilica LS, Stein GS and Stein LJ (eds.).

Gene isolation techniques based on expression properties may provide new tools for breeders both in early characterization of new cultivars and in improving drought tolerance via molecular breeding. The main aim of our project is to isolate new drought activated genes which may serve both purposes. As a first step, a subtracted cDNA library was prepared, which represents the difference in the mRNA populations of wheat plantlets grown under 400 mOsm polyethylene-glycol derived osmotic stress versus plantlets grown into optimal conditions. By applying the subtraction approach, the resulted cDNA library becomes enriched in clones of differentially expressed genes including the ones of rare messages as well. This allows us to clone these genes, sequence them and, later, perform in silico analysis. Our first results indicate that the resulted library is enriched in clones coding for membrane associated channel proteins as well as abscisic acid and stress responsive ones.","cDNA library; Drought tolerance; Subtraction; Wheat","abscisic acid; carrier protein; complementary DNA; macrogol; messenger RNA; agronomic trait; article; computer model; controlled study; cultivar identification; DNA library; drought; drought stress; drought tolerance; gene activation; gene expression; gene isolation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic code; molecular cloning; nonhuman; osmotic stress; plant breeding; plant growth; polymerase chain reaction; wheat",,"abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; carrier protein, 80700-39-6; macrogol, 25322-68-3",,,,"Cushman, J.C., Bohnert, H.J., Genomic approaches to plant stress tolerance (2000) Curr.

We studied the function of an A2-type cyclin from Medicago sativa (Medsa;cycA2) which, in contrast to animal and most plant A-type cyclins, was expressed in all phases of the cell cycle. Using synchronized alfalfa cell cultures and anti-Medsa;CycA2 polyclonal antibodies, we showed that while the mRNA level increased steadily from the late G1 to the G2-M phase, the protein level after a rapid increase in S-phase reached a plateau during the G2 phase. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the Medsa;CycA2 protein interacted with the PSTAIRE-motif-containing cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2MsA and with the maize retinoblastoma protein. Unexpectedly, the CycA2-associated kinase activity was biphasic: a first activity peak occurred in the S phase while the major one occurred during the G2/M transition, with no apparent dependence upon the actual levels of the Medsa;CycA2 and Cdc2MsA proteins. Immunohistological localization of the cyclin A2 protein by immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling revealed the presence of Medsa;CycA2 in the nucleus of the interphase and prophase cells, while it was undetectable thereafter during mitosis. Together these data suggest that Medsa;CycA2 plays a role both in the S phase and at the G2/M transition.","A-type cyclins; Cdk activity; Cell cycle regulation; Immunolocalization; Medicago sativa; Rb","cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle S phase; cell cycle; cell nucleus; cyclin A2; cyclin dependent kinase; enzyme activity; interphase; messenger RNA; plant cell culture; polyclonal antibody; prophase; protein localization; protein protein interaction; retinoblastoma protein; two hybrid system; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Cell Cycle; Cell Nucleus; Cells, Cultured; Cyclin A; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases; DNA Primers; Medicago sativa; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Binding; Retinoblastoma Protein; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Zea mays; Animalia; Medicago sativa; Zea mays",,"Cyclin A; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; DNA Primers; Retinoblastoma Protein",,,,"Aronson, M.N., Meyer, A.D., Györgyey, J., Katul, L., Vetten, J.H., Gronenborn, B., Timchenko, T., Clink, a nanovirus-encoded protein binds both pRb and Skp1 (2000) J.

Indeterminate nodules representing different stages of the developmental program are especially suited to the study of organogenesis. With the vector λHybriZAP, a cDNA library was constructed from emerging nodules of Medicago truncatula induced by Sinorhizobium meliloti. The 5' ends of 389 cDNA clones were sequenced, then these ESTs were analyzed both by sequence homology search and by studying their expression in roots and nodules. Two hundred fifty-six ESTs exhibited significant similarities to characterized data base entries and 40 of them represented 26 nodulin genes, while 133 had no similarity to sequences with known function. Only 60 out of the 389 cDNA clones corresponded to previously submitted M. truncatula EST sequences. For 117 cDNAs, reverse Northern (RNA) hybridization with root and nodule RNA probes revealed enhanced expression in the nodule, 48 clones are likely to code for novel nodulins, 33 cDNAs are clones of already known nodulin genes, and 36 clones exhibit similarity to other characterized genes. Thus, systematic analysis of the EST sequences and their expression patterns is a powerful way to identify nodule-specific and nodulation-related genes.",,"cDNA library; clone; complementary DNA; developmental genetics; expressed sequence tag; expression vector; gene sequencing; nodulation; nodulin; northern blotting; organogenesis; RNA probe; sequence homology; Sinorhizobium meliloti; Blotting, Northern; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gene Library; Leghemoglobin; Medicago sativa; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Roots; RNA, Plant; Sinorhizobium meliloti; Symbiosis; Animalia; Medicago truncatula; Sinorhizobium meliloti","GENBANK: AJ388667, AJ388668, AJ388669, AJ388670, AJ388671, AJ388672, AJ388673, AJ388674, AJ388675, AJ388676, AJ388677, AJ388678, AJ388679, AJ388680, AJ388681, AJ388682, AJ388683, AJ388684, AJ388685, AJ388686, AJ388687, AJ388688, AJ388689, AJ388690, AJ388691, AJ388692, AJ388693, AJ388694, AJ388695, AJ388696","Leghemoglobin; RNA, Plant",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402; Barker, D.G., Gallusci, P., Lullien, V., Khan, H., Gherardi, M., Huguet, T., Identification of two groups of leghemoglobin genes in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and a study of their expression during root nodule development (1988) Plant Mol.

Found., Derkovits fasor 2, 6726 Szeged, Hungary","Differential screening of a cDNA library of 2,4-dichlorophenoxiacetic acid (2,4-D)-treated alfalfa (Medicago sativa) callus tissues resulted in the isolation of a 571 bp cDNA clone (MsPRP5) encoding for a proline-rich protein (84 amino acids) with a specific repeat unit of TPVLPPR(κ)/(R)GRPPPVPP. In addition, a characteristic amino acid block (PPVYK) previously found in other proline-rich proteins also occurs in the C-terminal region of MsPRP5. At the N-terminal, a signal peptide similar to leader sequences of extracellular proteins can be predicted. According to the northern analysis, the corresponding gene is not expressed or is weakly expressed in differentiated vegetative organs and somatic embryos. However the accumulation of MsPRP5 mRNA is auxin concentration-dependent in dedifferentiated callus tissue. An increase in the amount of steady-state mRNA was detected already 20 min after auxin shock (100 μM 2.4-D). Maximum expression was observed at 24-48 h in the presence of 2,4-D. Elevated expression was also found in cells recovering after heat shock and wounding stress. In synchronized alfalfa cells, the transcript level of MsPRP5 gene fluctuated during cell cycle progression with peaks in G1/S phase cells. Considering the structural features and expression properties of MsPRP5, this clone may represents a new type of proline-rich protein gene which responds to hormonal shock and some other stresses as well.","Auxin response;

Sequence analysis revealed a regular organization of three non-homologous subrepeats forming tandemly-arranged composite repetitive units. Interpretation of Southern hybridization patterns based on the known sequence data suggests that the isolated sequence element represents an abundant organization type, although the presence of simple tandem arrays of the subrepeats is also indicated. Seventy-four percent sequence similarity was found between one of the S. brevidens subrepeats (Sb4AX) and a satellite DNA (TGRI) localized as a subtelomeric repeat on almost all Lycopersicon esculentum chromosomes. Insitu hybridization indicated that, similarly to TGRI, the S. brevidens-specific repeats are located at the ends of the arms of several chromosomes. On the basis of the data obtained, a common ancestral sequence can be proposed for the tomato (TGRI) and the S. brevidens (Sb4AX) repeat however, the molecular organization of this element in these two species evolved in a basically different manner. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Intergeneric homology;

We have recently isolated a cdc2 gene from alfalfa. Here, we report the isolation of two cyclin genes, cycMs1 and cycMs2, from alfalfa. The cycMs2 gene shows highest similarity to type B cyclins. In contrast, the predicted amino acid sequence of the cycMs1 gene shows similar homology scores to cyclins of all types (25 to 35%). Both genes are expressed in dividing suspension cultured cells but cease to be expressed when the cells enter stationary phase. In synchronized alfalfa suspension cultured cells, the mRNAs of cycMs1 and cycMs2 show maximal expression in the G2 and M phases. Transcripts of cycMs2 are found only in late G2 and M phase cells, an expression pattern typical for cyclin B genes, whereas cycMs1 appears with the onset of G2. This pattern indicates that alfalfa cycMs1 and cycMs2 belong to different classes of cyclins. In young leaves, expression of both genes is high, whereas in mature leaves no transcripts can be detected, indicating that the two cyclin genes are true cell division markers at the mRNA level. In other organs, a more complex expression pattern of the two cyclin genes was found.",,"cycline; CycMs1 protein, Medicago sativa; cycMs2 protein, Medicago sativa; DNA; vegetable protein; alfalfa; amino acid sequence; antibody specificity; article; cell culture; cell cycle; classification; cytology; gene expression regulation; genetics; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Cell Cycle; Cells, Cultured; Cyclins; DNA; Gene Expression Regulation; Medicago sativa; Molecular Sequence Data; Organ Specificity; Plant Proteins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","GENBANK: X68740, X68741","Cyclins; CycMs1 protein, Medicago sativa; cycMs2 protein, Medicago sativa; DNA, 9007-49-2; Plant Proteins",,,,,"Hirt, H.; Inst. of Microbiology and Genetics, University of Vienna, Vienna Biocenter, Dr. Bohrgasse 9, 1030 Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,10404651,,PLCEE,1307238,"English","Plant Cell",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027033949

Box 521, 6701, Hungary","Northern analysis has revealed substantial differences in mRNA accumulation of the two histone H3 gene variants represented by pH3c-1 and pH3c-11 cDNA clones. Both in partially synchronized cell suspension cultures and in protoplast-derived cells from alfalfa, Medicago varia, the maximal level of the histone H3-1 gene transcript coincided with the peak in [3≤H]thymidine incorporation. Histone H3-11 mRNA was detectable in cells throughout the period of the cell cycle studied. Various stress factors such as medium replacement, enzyme digestion of the cell wall, osmotic shock, and auxin treatment considerably increased the level of the histone H3-11 transcript. In alfalfa (Medicago sativa), the presence of H3-11 mRNA in unorganized tissues of microcallus suspension and in somatic embryos induced by auxin treatment supports the idea that this H3 variant exists in a continously active state of transcription. During embryo development, the early globular stage embryos showed increased accumulation of histone H3-11 mRNA in comparison with the later stages. The highest level of the histone H3-1 transcript was detectable 1 day after treatment of callus tissues with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Somatic embryos contained appreciable levels of histone H3-1 transcripts at all stages of somatic embryo development. These observations suggest that the histone H3-1 gene belongs to the class of replication-dependent histone genes. The histone H3-11 gene showed characteristics of a constitutively expressed replacement-type histone gene, with a specific characteristic that external factors can influence the level of gene transcription.",,"Medicago; Medicago sativa; Medicago sativa subsp. x varia",,,,,,,"Institute of Plant Physiology, Biological Research Center, Hungarian Academy of Sciences Szeged, P.O.

The encoded protein is 64% identical to the yeast and mammalian counterparts and shows all the prominent structural features known from these organisms. Antibody raised against a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide with crossreactivity against p34 proteins recognized a 34-kilodalton protein in extracts of alfalfa cells. When transferred into a fission yeast, the plant cdc2 homolog can complement a temperature-sensitive cdc2 mutant. Northern analysis revealed higher transcript levels in shoots and suspension cultures than in roots. In addition to the dominant transcript of 1.4 kilobases detected in the poly(A)+ fraction, 2.5- and 1.2-kilobase transcripts were detected in total RNA preparations from shoots or somatic embryos. Suspension cultures that were induced to form somatic embryos by an auxin (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) showed fluctuations in transcription pattern during the induction period and embryogenesis.","2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; Medicago saliva L; Plant cell culture; Plant cell cycle; Somatic embryogenesis","protein kinase; article; cell cycle; embryo; embryo development; genetic transcription; nonhuman; plant cell; priority journal; yeast; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Cell Cycle; Comparative Study; Genetic Complementation Test; Human; Medicago sativa; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotide Probes; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Kinases; Protein p34cdc2; Schizosaccharomyces; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","GENBANK: M55996, M58060, M58061, M58062, M58063, M58064, M58065, M58066, M58067, M58365","Oligonucleotide Probes; Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Protein p34cdc2, EC 2.7.1.37",,,,,"Hirt, H.; Inst. of Microbiology and Genetics, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,2000373,"English","Proc.

Box 521, Szeged, 6701, Hungary","We have isolated two cDNA clones (Mshsp18-1; Mshsp18-2) from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) which encode for small heat shock proteins (HSPs) belonging to the hsp17 subfamily. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two alfalfa proteins are 92% identical and a similar degree of homology (90%) can be detected between Mshsp 18-2 and the pea hsp 17. In comparison to various members of small HSPs from soybean amino acid sequence similarities of 80-86% were identified. The alfalfa HSPs share a homologous stretch of amino acids in the carboxy terminal region with hsp22, 23, 26 from Drosophila. This region contains the GVLTV motif which is characteristic of several members of small HSPs. At room temperature alfalfa hsp 18 mRNAs were not detectable in root and leaf tissues but northern analysis showed a low level of expression in microcallus suspension (MCS). The transcription of Mshsp 18 genes is induced by elevated temperature, CdCl2 treatment and osmotic shock in cultured cells. In alfalfa somatic embryos derived from MCS a considerable amount of hsp 18 mRNA can be detected during the early embryogenic stages under normal culture conditions.
