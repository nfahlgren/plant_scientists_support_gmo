During abscission, changes in cellular adhesion of specialized abscission zone cells ensure the detachment of infected organs or those no longer serving a function to the plant. In addition, abscission also plays an important role in the release of ripe fruits. Different plant species display distinct patterns and timing of organ shedding, most likely adapted during evolution to their diverse life styles. However, it appears that key regulators of cell separation may have conserved function in different plant species. Here, we investigate the functional conservation of the citrus ortholog of the Arabidopsis peptide ligand INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (AtIDA), controlling floral organ abscission. We discuss the possible implications of modifying the citrus IDA ortholog for citrus fruit production. © 2015 Estornell, Wildhagen, Pérez-Amador, Talón, Tadeo and Butenko.","Citrus; Crop yield; Floral abscission; Fruit production; HAESA; IDA; Receptor-like kinases",,,,,,,"Aalen, R.B., Wildhagen, M., Sto, I.M., Butenko, M.A., Ida: A peptide ligand regulating cell separation processes in Arabidopsis (2013) J.

One well-studied example is INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA), which controls floral organ abscission and lateral root emergence in Arabidopsis thaliana. IDA belongs to a family of five additional IDA-LIKE (IDL) members that have all been suggested to be involved in regulation of Arabidopsis development. Here we present three novel members of the IDL subfamily and show that two of them are strongly and rapidly induced by different biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, we provide data that the recently identified PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE (PIP) and PIP-LIKE (PIPL) peptides, which show similarity to the IDL and C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP) peptides, are not only involved in innate immune response in Arabidopsis but are also induced by abiotic stress. Expression patterns of the IDA/IDL and PIP/PIPL genes were analysed using in silico data, qRT-PCR and GUS promoter lines. Transcriptomic responses to PIPL3 peptide treatment suggested a role in regulation of biotic stress responses and cell wall modification. © 2015 The Author.","Arabidopsis; evolution; gene expression; INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION; peptide ligand","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,,,,,"Aalen, R.B., Wildhagen, M., Stø, I.M., Butenko, M.A., IDA: A peptide ligand regulating cell separation processes in Arabidopsis (2013) Journal of Experimental Botany, 64, pp. 5253-5261; Ahuja, I., Kissen, R., Bones, A.M., Phytoalexins in defense against pathogens (2012) Trends in Plant Science, 17, pp. 73-90; Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schäffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Research, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Amano, Y., Tsubouchi, H., Shinohara, H., Ogawa, M., Matsubayashi, Y., Tyrosine-sulfated glycopeptide involved in cellular proliferation and expansion in Arabidopsis (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 104, pp. 18333-18338; Ashburner, M., Ball, C.A., Blake, J.A., Gene Ontology: Tool for the unification of biology (2000) Nature Genetics, 25, pp. 25-29; Belmonte, M.F., Kirkbride, R.C., Stone, S.L., Comprehensive developmental profiles of gene activity in regions and subregions of the Arabidopsis seed (2013) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 110, pp. E435-E444; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate - A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Several small signalling peptides and receptor kinases have been shown to affect primary root growth, but very little is known about their role in lateral root development. In this context, the CLE family, a group of small signalling peptides that has been shown to affect a wide range of developmental processes, were the focus of this study. Here, the expression pattern during lateral root initiation for several CLE family members is explored and to what extent CLE1, CLE4, CLE7, CLE26, and CLE27, which show specific expression patterns in the root, are involved in regulating root architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana is assessed. Using chemically synthesized peptide variants, it was found that CLE26 plays an important role in regulating A. thaliana root architecture and interacts with auxin signalling. In addition, through alanine scanning and in silico structural modelling, key residues in the CLE26 peptide sequence that affect its activity are pinpointed. Finally, some interesting similarities and differences regarding the role of CLE26 in regulating monocot root architecture are presented. © 2015 The Author.","Arabidopsis thaliana; auxin; Brachypodium distachyon;

However, a major obstacle in identifying the function of genes encoding small signalling peptides is the limited number of available loss-of-function mutants. To overcome this, a promising new tool, antagonistic peptide technology, was recently developed. Here, this antagonistic peptide technology was tested on selected CLE peptides and the related IDA peptide and its usefulness in the context of studies of peptide function discussed. Based on the analyses, it was concluded that the antagonistic peptide approach is not the ultimate means to overcome redundancy or lack of loss-of-function lines. However, information collected using antagonistic peptide approaches (in the broad sense) can be very useful, but these approaches do not work in all cases and require a deep insight on the interaction between the ligand and its receptor to be successful. This, as well as peptide ligand structure considerations, should be taken into account before ordering a wide range of synthetic peptide variants and/or generating transgenic plants. © 2015 The Author.","CLE;

To do this, plants must maintain a population of stem cells within the meristems, and at the same time, closely control the identity and position of cells at the meristem boundaries as they differentiate to new leaf or flower primordia. Once developed, organs may need to be shed, either as a controlled developmental decision-such as floral abscission after pollination, or as a response to disease, environmental stress, and predators. Cell wall degradation at specialized abscission zone (AZ) cells needs to occur for this to take place, but since there is little cell rearrangement in plants, cell separation events are also important for plant architecture. In this Opinion paper we discuss the role of two peptide ligand signalling systems that control stem cell homeostasis and cell separation, respectively. We draw parallels between the signalling pathways and explore on the commonalities of the downstream components activated and controlled by the signalling peptides. We provide evidence for AZ cells having a meristem identity and discuss the role of identical KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) transcription factors in meristem maintenance and abscission. Lastly we explore the evolutionary relationship between the pathways. © 2015 The Author.","Abscission; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; CLAVATA; INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION; receptor-kinase; signalling; stem cells.",,,,,,,"Aalen, R.B., Wildhagen, M., Sto, I.M., Butenko, M.A., IDA: A peptide ligand regulating cell separation processes in Arabidopsis (2013) Journal of Experimental Botany, 64, pp. 5253-5261; Aida, M., Tasaka, M., Morphogenesis and patterning at the organ boundaries in the higher plant shoot apex (2006) Plant Molecular Biology, 60, pp. 915-928; Ambrose, B.A., Ferrándiz, C., Development and the evolution of plant form (2013) Annual Plant Reviews, 45, pp. 277-320; Barton, M.K., Twenty years on: The inner workings of the shoot apical meristem, a developmental dynamo (2010) Developmental Biology, 341, pp. 95-113; Belles-Boix, E., Hamant, O., Witiak, S.M., Morin, H., Traas, J., Pautot, V., KNAT6: An Arabidopsis homeobox gene involved in meristem activity and organ separation (2006) The Plant Cell, 18, pp. 1900-1907; Betsuyaku, S., Takahashi, F., Kinoshita, A., Miwa, H., Shinozaki, K., Fukuda, H., Sawa, S., Mitogen-activated protein kinase regulated by the CLAVATA receptors contributes to shoot apical meristem homeostasis (2011) Plant Cell and Physiology, 52, pp. 14-29; Bleckmann, A., Weidtkamp-Peters, S., Seidel, C.A., Simon, R., Stem cell signaling in Arabidopsis requires CRN to localize CLV2 to the plasma membrane (2010) Plant Physiology, 152, pp. 166-176; Bleecker, A., Patterson, S.E., Last exit: Senescence, abscission, and meristem arrest in Arabidopsis (1997) The Plant Cell, 9, pp. 1169-1179; Bommert, P., Lunde, C., Nardmann, J., Vollbrecht, E., Running, M., Jackson, D., Hake, S., Werr, W., Thick tassel dwarf1 encodes a putative maize ortholog of the Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (2005) Development, 132, pp. 1235-1245; Brand, U., Fletcher, J.C., Hobe, M., Meyerowitz, E.M., Simon, R., Dependence of stem cell fate in Arabidopsis on a feedback loop regulated by CLV3 activity (2000) Science, 289, pp. 617-619; Butenko, M.A., Patterson, S.E., Grini, P.E., Stenvik, G.-E., Amundsen, S.S., Mandal, A., Aalen, R.B., INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT in ABSCISSION controls floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis and identifies a novel family of putative ligands in plants (2003) The Plant Cell, 15, pp. 2296-2307; Butenko, M.A., Stenvik, G.E., Alm, V., Saether, B., Patterson, S.E., Aalen, R.B., Ethylene-dependent and-independent pathways controlling floral abscission are revealed to converge using promoter::reporter gene constructs in the ida abscission mutant (2006) Journal of Experimental Botany, 57, pp. 3627-3637; Butenko, M.A., Vie, A.K., Brembu, T., Aalen, R.B., Bones, A.M., Plant peptides in signalling: Looking for new partners (2009) Trends in Plant Science, 14, pp. 255-263; Butenko, M.A., Kumpf, R., Aalen, R., (2013) Handbook of Biological Active Peptides, pp. 24-29. , IDA/IDL.

Several families of small, secreted proteins with a conserved C-terminal Pro-rich motif have been identified as functional peptide signals in Arabidopsis thaliana. These proteins are presumed to be trimmed proteolytically and undergo posttranslational modifications, such as hydroxylation of Pro residues and glycosylation, to form mature, bioactive signals. Identification and matching of such ligands with their respective receptors remains a major challenge since the genes encoding them often show redundancy and low expression restricted to a few cells or particular developmental stages. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the use of ectopic expression of receptor genes in suitable plant cells like Nicotiana benthamiana for testing ligand candidates in receptor output assays and in binding studies. As an example, we used the IDA peptide HAE/HSL2 receptor signaling system known to regulate floral organ abscission. We demonstrate that the oxidative burst response can be employed as readout for receptor activation by synthetic peptides and that a new, highly sensitive, nonradioactive labeling approach can be used to reveal a direct correlation between peptide activity and receptor affinity. We suggest that these approaches will be of broad value for the field of ligand-receptor studies in plants. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Mutations in NEVERSHED (NEV) or INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) block floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana. NEV encodes an ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein, and cells of nev mutant flowers display membrane-trafficking defects. IDA encodes a secreted peptide that signals through the receptor-like kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2). Analyses of single and double mutants revealed unique features of the nev and ida phenotypes. Cell-wall loosening was delayed in ida flowers. In contrast, nev and nev ida mutants displayed ectopic enlargement of abscission zone (AZ) cells, indicating that cell expansion alone is not sufficient to trigger organ loss. These results suggest that NEV initially prevents precocious cell expansion but is later integral for cell separation. IDA is involved primarily in the final cell separation step. A mutation in KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA1 (KNAT1), a suppressor of the ida mutant, could not rescue the abscission defects of nev mutant flowers, indicating that NEV-dependent activity downstream of KNAT1 is required. Transcriptional profiling of mutant AZs identified gene clusters regulated by IDA-HAE/HSL2. Several genes were more strongly downregulated innev-7 compared with ida and hae hsl2 mutants, consistent with the rapid inhibition of organ loosening in nev mutants, and the overlapping roles of NEV and IDA in cell separation. A model of the crosstalk between the IDA signalling pathway and NEV-mediated membrane traffic during floral organ abscission is presented. © The Author 2013.","ARF-GAP; Cell wall degradation; Cell wall loosening;

In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana the peptide INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) signals through the leucine-rich repeat-receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) HAESA (HAE), and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2) to control the abscission of floral organs after pollination. Recent work from other plant species indicates that this signalling system is conserved and could regulate leaf abscission in soybean and tomato. Abscission is a cell separation process involving the breakdown of cell walls between adjacent files of abscission zone (AZ) cells at the base of organs to be shed. The emergence of new lateral root primordia (LRP), initiated deep inside the root under the influence of the phytohormone auxin, is similarly dependent on cell wall dissolution to separate cells in the overlying tissues. It has been shown that this process also requires IDA, HAE, and HSL2. The receptors are redundant in function during floral organ abscission, but during lateral root emergence (LRE) they are differentially involved in regulating cell wall remodelling (CWR) genes. An overview is given here of the similarities and differences of IDA signalling during floral organ abscission and LRE. © The Author 2013.","Abscission; Cell separation; HAE; HSL2; IDA; Lateral root emergence","Arabidopsis protein; HSL2 protein, Arabidopsis; IDA protein, Arabidopsis; ligand; peptide; protein serine threonine kinase; RLK5 protein, Arabidopsis; abscission; Arabidopsis; cell communication; cell differentiation; cell separation; cell wall; cytology; flower; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; HAE; HSL2; IDA; lateral root emergence.; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; plant root; review; signal transduction; Abscission; cell separation; HAE; HSL2; IDA; lateral root emergence.; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation; Cell Wall; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ligands; Peptides; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Signal Transduction",,"protein serine threonine kinase",,,,"Aalen, R.B., Flower and floral organ abscission: Control, gene expression and hormone interaction (2011) The flowering process and its control in plants:Gene expression and hormone interaction, pp. 307-327. , In: Yaish M, ed.

Organs that have served their purpose may be shed after breakdown of primary cell walls between adjacent cell files at the site of detachment. In Arabidopsis, floral organs abscise after pollination, and this cell separation event is controlled by the peptide INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA), which signals through the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2). Emergence of new lateral root primordia, initiated deep inside the root under the influence of auxin, is similarly dependent on cell wall dissolution between cells in the overlaying endodermal, cortical, and epidermal tissues. Here we show that this process requires IDA, HAE, and HSL2. Mutation in these genes constrains the passage of the growing lateral root primordia through the overlaying layers, resulting in altered shapes of the lateral root primordia and of the overlaying cells. The HAE and HSL2 receptors are redundant in function during floral organ abscission, but during lateral root emergence they are differentially involved in regulating cell wall remodeling genes. In the root, IDA is strongly auxin-inducible and dependent on key regulators of lateral root emergence-the auxin influx carrier LIKE AUX1-3 and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7. The expression levels of the receptor genes are only transiently induced by auxin, suggesting they are limiting factors for cell separation. We conclude that elements of the same cell separation signaling module have been adapted to function in different developmental programs. © PNAS 2013.","Pectin degradation; Peptide signaling; Polygalacturonases;

One of these conditions is suboptimal water availability. Here, we review some of the classical approaches to dealing with plant response to drought stress and we evaluate how research on RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES (RLKs) can contribute to improving plant performance under drought stress. RLKs are considered as key regulators of plant architecture and growth behavior, but they also function in defense and stress responses. The available literature and analyses of available transcript profiling data indeed suggest that RLKs can play an important role in optimizing plant responses to drought stress. In addition, RLK pathways are ideal targets for nontransgenic approaches, such as synthetic molecules, providing a novel strategy to manipulate their activity and supporting translational studies from model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, to economically useful crops. copy; 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

It is however essential that such processes are under tight temporal and spatial regulation. Floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by a ligand-receptor module consisting of the signaling peptide INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) and the two receptor- like kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2), and it is the restricted expression pattern of IDA that hinders cell separation from occurring in the abscission zones (AZs) of other organs where HAE and HSL2 are present. In the July issue of The Plant Cell we report on the identification of additional components acting downstream in the IDA signaling pathway. Through a screen for mutations that restore floral organ abscission in ida mutants, we identified two new alleles of the KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP)/KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA1 (KNAT1) and show that BP/KNAT1 is important in regulating the timing of floral abscission by controlling AZ cell size and by regulating KNAT2 and KNAT6. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.","Cell elongation; Cell separation; Cell signaling; Floral organ abscission; HAE; HSL2; IDA; KNOX proteins","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis protein; Arabidopsis; article; flower; physiology; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Flowers; Signal Transduction",,"Arabidopsis Proteins",,,,"Butenko, M.A., Aalen, R.B., Receptor ligands in development (2012) Receptor-like Kinases In Plants: From Development to Defense: Springer Verlag Series Signaling and Communication In Plants, 13. , .

The IDA signaling pathway presumably activates a MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK) cascade to induce separation between abscission zone (AZ) cells. Misexpression of IDA effectuates precocious floral abscission and ectopic cell separation in latent AZ cell regions, which suggests that negative regulators are in place to prevent unrestricted and untimely AZ cell separation. Through a screen for mutations that restore floral organ abscission in ida mutants, we identified three new mutant alleles of the KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP)/KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA1 (KNAT1). Here, we show that bp mutants, in addition to shedding their floral organs prematurely, have phenotypic commonalities with plants misexpressing IDA, such as enlarged AZ cells. We propose that BP/KNAT1 inhibits floral organ cell separation by restricting AZ cell size and number and put forward a model whereby IDA signaling suppresses BP/KNAT1, which in turn allows KNAT2 and KNAT6 to induce floral organ abscission. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Arabidopsis protein; homeodomain protein; hybrid protein; IDA protein, Arabidopsis; KNAT1 protein, Arabidopsis; KNAT2 protein, Arabidopsis; KNAT6 protein, Arabidopsis; protein serine threonine kinase; RLK5 protein, Arabidopsis; transcription factor; Arabidopsis; article; flower; gene expression regulation; genetic complementation; genetics; histology; metabolism; mutation; phenotype; physiology; promoter region; signal transduction; transgenic plant; ultrastructure; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genetic Complementation Test; Homeodomain Proteins; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mutation; Phenotype; Plants, Genetically Modified; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Transcription Factors; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; Homeodomain Proteins; IDA protein, Arabidopsis; KNAT1 protein, Arabidopsis; KNAT2 protein, Arabidopsis; KNAT6 protein, Arabidopsis; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases, 2.7.11.1; RLK5 protein, Arabidopsis, 2.7.1.-; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,"Aalen, R.B., Flower and floral organ abscission: Control, gene expression and hormone interaction (2011) The Flowering Process and Its Control In Plants: Gene Expression and Hormone Interaction, M.W.

A GMO will differ from its parental strain in that its pool of transcripts will be altered. Currently, there are no methods that are reliably able to determine if an organism has been genetically altered if the nature of the modification is unknown. Results: We show that the concept of computational subtraction can be used to identify transgenic cDNA sequences from genetically modified plants. Our datasets include 454-type sequences from a transgenic line of Arabidopsis thaliana and published EST datasets from commercially relevant species (rice and papaya). Conclusion: We believe that computational subtraction represents a powerful new strategy for determining if an organism has been genetically modified as well as to define the nature of the modification. Fewer assumptions have to be made compared to methods currently in use and this is an advantage particularly when working with unknown GMOs. © 2009 Tengs et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Arabidopsis thaliana;

Furthermore, several IDA-LIKE (IDL) proteins, which contain a conserved C-terminal domain resembling that of the CLAVATA (CLV)3-ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-RELATED (CLE) protein family, have been shown to be partially redundant with IDA. Here, we use the genetic similarities between the IDA and CLV3 signalling systems to hypothesize that closely related peptide ligands are likely to interact with families of closely related RLKs. Guided by this hypothesis and with the aid of genetics and novel methods, ligand-receptor systems can be identified to improve our understanding of developmental processes in plants. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To assure that the plant's integrity is not compromised, such events, which depend on cell wall degradation, have to be tightly controlled both in time and space. The final step of floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis is controlled by INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA), in that mutation of IDA causes a block in abscission. Overexpression results in early abscission of floral organs. In a recent article we show that this is also the case when overexpressing the related IDA-LIKE (IDL) proteins, indicating a degree of functional redundancy. Based on gene swap and deletion constructs introduced in the ida mutant and synthetic peptide assays we demonstrated that the conserved C-terminal motif (EPIP) of IDA and IDL1 was sufficient to replace IDA function. This function is dependent on the presence of the receptor-like kinases (RLK) HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2), suggesting that an IDA peptide acts as a ligand interacting with these receptors. Our study further revealed that the five IDL genes are expressed at various sites where cell separation takes place. We suggest that the IDL proteins constitute a family of ligands that act through RLKs similar to HAESA and control cell separation at different sites and development stages during the life of the plant. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.","Arabidopsis; Cell separation; Gene-family; HAE; IDA; Ligand; Receptor; Signaling","Arabidopsis",,,,,,"Wang, Z.-Y., He, J.-X., Brassinosteroid signal transduction - Choices of signals and receptors (2004) Trends Plant Sci, 9, pp. 91-96; Gallagher, K.L., Benfey, P.N., Not just another hole in the wall: Understanding intercellular protein trafficking (2005) Genes Dev, 19, pp. 189-195; Kim, J.-Y., Regulation of short-distance transport of RNA and protein (2005) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 8, pp. 45-52; Shiu, S.H., Bleecker, A.B., Receptor-like kinases from Arabidopsis form a monophyletic gene family related to animal receptor kinases (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98, pp. 10763-10768; Freshour, G., Clay, R.P., Fuller, M.S., Albersheim, P., Darvill, A.G., Hahn, M.G., Developmental and tissue-specific structural alterations of the cell-wall polysaccharides of Arabidopsis thaliana Roots (1996) Plant Physiol, 110, pp. 1413-1429; Juge, N., Plant protein inhibitors of cell wall degrading enzymes (2006) Trends Plant Sci, 11, pp. 359-367; Martin C, Bhatt K, Baumann K.

Loss-of-function bop1 bop2 mutants display a range of developmental defects, including a loss of floral organ abscission. Abscission occurs along specialised cell files, called abscission zones (AZS) that develop at the junction between the leaving organ and main plant body. We have characterized the bop1 bop2 abscission phenotype to determine how BOP1 and BOP2 contribute to the known abscission developmental framework. Histological analysis and petal breakstrength measurements of bop1 bop2 flowers show no differentiation of floral AZs. Furthermore, vestigial cauline leaf AZs are also undifferentiated in bop1 bop2 mutants, suggesting that BOP proteins are essential to establish AZ cells in different tissues. In support of this hypothesis, BOP1/BOP2 activity is required for both premature floral organ abscission and the ectopic abscission of cauline leaves promoted by the INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) gene under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Expression of several abscission-related marker genes, including IDA, is relatively unperturbed in bop1 bop2 mutants, indicating that these AZ genes respond to positional cues that are independent of BOP1/BOP2 activity. We also show that BOP1 and BOP2 promote growth of nectary glands, which normally develop at the receptacle adjacent to developing AZs. Taken together, these data suggest that BOP1/BOP2 activity is required for multiple cell differentiation events in the proximal regions of inflorescence lateral organs.","Abscission; BLADE-ON-PETIOLE; Flower development; INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION","Arabidopsis protein; protein BOP1; protein BOP2; protein IDA; vegetable protein; abscission zone; article; cell differentiation; controlled study; flower development; gene expression; gene interaction; mutant; nectar; nonhuman; petal; phenotype; plant cell; plant genetics; plant leaf; plant tissue; priority journal; promoter region; protein function; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; Body Patterning; DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Models, Biological; Mutation; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transcription Factors; Arabidopsis",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; BOP1 protein, Arabidopsis; BOP2 protein, Arabidopsis; CRC protein, Arabidopsis; DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; IDA protein, Arabidopsis; Transcription Factors",,,,"Addicott, F.T., (1982) Abscission, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Aida, M., Tasaka, M., Genetic control of shoot organ boundaries (2006) Curr.

We have developed a strategy for detection and characterization of unknown genetic modifications and we present a proof of concept for this method using Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). The approach relies on direct hybridization of total genomic DNA to high density microarrays designed to have probes tiled throughout a set of reference sequences. Results: We show that by using arrays with 25 basepair probes covering both strands of a set of 235 vectors (2 million basepairs) we can detect transgene sequences in transformed lines of A. thaliana and rice without prior knowledge about the transformation vectors or the T-DNA constructs used to generate the studied plants. Conclusion: The approach should allow the user to detect the presence of transgene sequences and get sufficient information for further characterization of unknown genetic constructs in plants. The only requirements are access to a small amount of pure transgene plant material, that the genetic construct in question is above a certain size (here ≥ 140 basepairs) and that parts of the construct shows some degree of sequence similarity with published genetic elements. © 2007 Tengs et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Crops; Cultivation; DNA; Genes; Microarrays; Probes; Arabidopsis thaliana; Genetic modifications; Oryza sativa; Transgene constructs; Genetic engineering; Arabidopsis; article; base pairing; controlled study; DNA hybridization; DNA microarray; DNA modification; DNA probe; DNA vector; gene construct; gene sequence; genetic analysis; microarray analysis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant genetics; rice; sequence homology; transgene; Arabidopsis; chromosome map; DNA probe; DNA sequence; genetics; methodology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; rice; Arabidopsis thaliana; Oryza sativa; plant DNA; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Chromosome Mapping; DNA Mutational Analysis; DNA Probes; DNA, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oryza sativa; Sequence Analysis, DNA","GENBANK: AF485783","DNA Probes; DNA, Plant",,,,"James, C., Global status of commercialized biotech/GM crops: 2006 (2006) ISAAA Brief 35 - 2006, , International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA); Macilwain, C., US launches probe into sales of unapproved transgenic corn (2005) Nature, 434, p. 423. , 10.1038/nature03570 15791213; Vogel, G., Genetically modified crops.

One gene that is absolutely required for abscission is INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, IDA, as the ida mutant is completely blocked in abscission. To elucidate the genetic pathways regulating floral abscission, molecular markers expressed in the floral abscission zone have been studied in an ida mutant background. Using plants with promoter-reporter gene constructs including promoters of a novel FLORAL ABSCISSION ASSOCIATED gene (FAA) encoding a putative single-stranded binding protein (BASIL), chitinase (CHIT::GUS) and cellulase (BAC::GUS), it is shown that IDA acts in the last steps of the abscission process. These markers, as well as HAESA, encoding a receptor-like kinase, were unaffected in their temporal expression patterns in ida compared with wild-type plants; thus showing that different regulatory pathways are active in the abscission process. In contrast to BASIL, CHIT::GUS and BAC::GUS showed, however, much weaker induction of expression in an ida background, consistent with a reduction in pathogen-associated responses and a lack of total dissolution of cell walls in the mutant. IDA, encoding a putative secreted peptide ligand, and HAESA appeared to have identical patterns of expression in floral abscission zones. Lastly, to address the role of ethylene, IDA::GUS expression in the wild type and the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1 was compared. Similar temporal patterns, yet restricted spatial expression patterns were observed in etr1-1, suggesting that the pathways regulated by IDA and by ethylene act in parallel, but are, to some degree, interdependent. © 2006 The Author(s).","Cellulase; Chitinase; Floral abscission associated gene; HAESA; Wounding","Cellulose; Ethylene; Plant cell culture; Chitinase; Floral abscission associated gene; HAESA; Wounding; Genetic engineering; Arabidopsis protein; ethylene; ethylene derivative; green fluorescent protein; hybrid protein; IDA protein, Arabidopsis; protein serine threonine kinase; RLK5 protein, Arabidopsis; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; bean; flower; genetics; growth, development and aging; in situ hybridization; metabolism; mutation; promoter region; reporter gene; soybean; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Ethylenes; Flowers; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; In Situ Hybridization; Mutation; Phaseolus; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Soybeans; Cellulose; Cytology; Ethylene; Genetic Engineering; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"ethylene, 74-85-1; Arabidopsis Proteins; ethylene, 74-85-1; Ethylenes; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; IDA protein, Arabidopsis; Plant Proteins; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; RLK5 protein, Arabidopsis, EC 2.7.1.-",,,,"Addicott, F.T., (1982) Abscission, , University of California Press, Berkeley; Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Barnes, D., Cohen, A., Bruick, R.K., Kantardjieff, K., Fowler, S., Efuet, E., Mayfield, S.P., Identification and characterization of a novel RNA binding protein that associates with the 5′-untranslated region of the chloroplast psbA mRNA (2004) Biochemistry, 43, pp. 8541-8550; Bleecker, A.B., Estelle, M.A., Somerville, C., Kende, H., Insensitivity to ethylene conferred by a dominant mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana (1988) Science, 241, pp. 1086-1089; Bleecker, A.B., Patterson, S.E., Last exit: Senescence, abscission, and meristem arrest in Arabidopsis (1997) The Plant Cell, 9, pp. 1169-1179; Bleecker, A.B., Schaller, G.E., The mechanism of ethylene perception (1996) Plant Physiolology, 111, pp. 653-660; Broglie, K.E., Biddle, P., Cressman, R., Broglie, R., Functional analysis of DNA sequences responsible for ethylene regulation of a bean chitinase gene in transgenic tobacco (1989) The Plant Cell, 1, pp. 599-607; Brown, K.M., Ethylene and abscission (1997) Physiologia Plantarum, 100, pp. 567-576; Brummell, D., Catala, C., Lashbrook, C., Bennett, A.B., A membrane-anchored E-type endo-1,4-β-glucanase is localized on Golgi and plasma membranes of higher plants (1997) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 94, pp. 4794-4799; Butenko, M.A., Patterson, S.E., Grini, P.E., Stenvik, G.-E., Amundsen, S.S., Mandal, A., Aalen, R.B., INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT in ABSCISSION controls floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis and identifies a novel family of putative ligands in plants (2003) The Plant Cell, 15, pp. 2296-2307; Chen, Q.G., Bleecker, A.B., Analysis of ethylene signal-transduction kinetics associated with seedling-growth response and chitinase induction in wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis (1995) Plant Physiology, 108, pp. 597-607; Cho, H.-T., Cosgrove, D., Altered expression of expansin modulates leaf growth and pedicel abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 97, pp. 9783-9788; Coupe, S.A., Taylor, J.E., Roberts, J.A., Temporal and spatial expression of mRNAs encoding pathogenesis-related proteins during ethylene-promoted leaflet abscission in Sambucus nigra (1997) Plant, Cell and Environment, 20, pp. 1517-1524; Del Campillo, E., Lewis, L.N., Identification and kinetics of accumulation of proteins induced by ethylene in bean abscission zones (1992) Plant Physiology, 98, pp. 955-961; Del Campillo, E., Reide, P.D., Sexton, R., Lewis, L.N., Occurrence and localization of 9.5 cellulase in abscising and nonabscising tissues (1990) The Plant Cell, 2, pp. 245-254; Delessert, C., Wilson, I.W., Van Der Straeten, D., Dennis, E.S., Dolferus, R., Spatial and temporal analysis of the local response to wounding in Arabidopsis leaves (2004) Plant Molecular Biology, 55, pp. 165-181; Dinneny, J.R., Yanofsky, M.F., Drawing lines and borders: How the dehiscent fruit of Arabidopsis is patterned (2005) BioEssays, 27, pp. 42-49; Fernandez, D.E., Heck, G.R., Perry, S.E., Patterson, S.E., Bleecker, A.B., Fang, S.C., The embryo MADS domain factor AGL15 acts postembryonically.

The differential pattern of organ abscission in different species is most likely the result of evolutionary adaptation to a variety of life styles and environments. The final step of abscission-related cell separation in floral organs of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana, which only abscises sepals, petals, and stamens, is controlled by INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA). Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis 35S:IDA lines constitutively overexpressing IDA exhibit earlier abscission of floral organs, showing that the abscission zones are responsive to IDA soon after the opening of the flowers. In addition, ectopic abscission was observed at the bases of the pedicel, branches of the inflorescence, and cauline leaves. The silique valves also dehisced prematurely. Scanning electron microscopy indicated a spread of middle lamella degradation from preformed abscission zone cells to neighboring cells. A transcript encoding an arabinogalactan protein (AGP) was upregulated in the 35S:IDA lines, and large amounts of AGF were secreted at the sites of abscission.

Because the purpose of the flower is to facilitate pollination, it often is abscised after fertilization. We have identified an Arabidopsis ethylene-sensitive mutant, inflorescence deficient in abscission (ida), in which floral organs remain attached to the plant body after the shedding of mature seeds, even though a floral abscission zone develops. The IDA gene, positioned in the genomic DNA flanking the single T-DNA present in the ida line, was identified by complementation. The gene encodes a small protein with an N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting that the IDA protein is the ligand of an unknown receptor involved in the developmental control of floral abscission. We have identified Arabidopsis genes, and cDNAs from a variety of plant species, that encode similar proteins, which are distinct from known ligands.

Occasionally, single-copy transgenes also suffer transgene silencing. We have compared integration patterns and T-DNA/plant DNA junctions in a collection of 37 single-copy T-DNA-transformed Arabidopsis lines, of which 13 displayed silencing. Vector sequences were found integrated in five lines, but only one of these displayed silencing. Truncated T-DNA copies, positioned in inverse orientation to an intact T-DNA copy, were discovered in three lines. The whole nptII gene with pnos promoter was present in the truncated copy of one such line in which heavy silencing has been observed. In the two other lines no silencing has been observed over five generations. Thus, vector sequences and short additional T-DNA sequences are not sufficient or necessary to induce transgene silencing. DNA methylation of selected restriction endonuclease sites could not be correlated with silencing. Our collection of T-DNA/plant DNA junctions has also been used to evaluate current models of T-DNA integration. Data for some of our lines are compatible with T-DNA integration in double-strand breaks, while for others initial invasion of plant DNA by the left or by the right T-DNA end seem important.",,"double stranded DNA; plant DNA; restriction endonuclease; Arabidopsis; article; controlled study; DNA integration; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; DNA strand breakage; DNA vector; gene silencing; genetic analysis; genetic transformation; inverted repeat; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; restriction site; transgene; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Cell Line, Transformed; DNA Methylation; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Plant; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Silencing; Genetic Vectors; Plants, Genetically Modified; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Sequence Deletion; Transformation, Genetic; Transgenes; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta",,"DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Plant; T-DNA",,,,"Gheysen, G., Angenon, G., Van Montagu, M., Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation: A scientifically intriguing story with significant applications (1998) Transgenic Plant Research, pp. 1-33. , Lindsey,K.
