Intensively managed, highly productive forestry incorporating the most advanced methods for tree breeding, including the application of genetic engineering (GE), has tremendous potential for producing more wood on less land. However, the deployment of GE trees in plantation forests is a controversial topic and concerns have been particularly expressed about potential harms to the environment. This paper, prepared by an international group of experts in silviculture, forest tree breeding, forest biotechnology and environmental risk assessment (ERA) that met in April 2012, examines how the ERA paradigm used for GE crop plants may be applied to GE trees for use in plantation forests. It emphasizes the importance of differentiating between ERA for confined field trials of GE trees, and ERA for unconfined or commercial-scale releases. In the case of the latter, particular attention is paid to characteristics of forest trees that distinguish them from shorter-lived plant species, the temporal and spatial scale of forests, and the biodiversity of the plantation forest as a receiving environment. © 2013 ILSI Research Foundation.","Environment; Forests; Genetic engineering; Risk assessment","biodiversity; environment; environmental protection; forests; genetic engineering; review; risk assessment; transgenic plant; tree; environment; forests; genetic engineering; risk assessment; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Plants, Genetically Modified; Risk Assessment; Trees",,,,,,"Ahtikoski, A., Ojansuu, R., Haapanen, M., Hynynen, J., Kärkkäinen, K., Financial performance of using genetically improved regeneration material of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Finland (2012) New Forest., 43, pp. 335-348; Ahuja, M., Transgene stability and dispersal in forest trees (2009) Trees, 23, pp. 1125-1135; Ahuja, M., Fate of transgenes in the forest tree genome (2011) Tree Genet.

Inevitable governmental regulations will likely address environmental, economic and human health impacts. Proactive addressing of such regulatory protection goals should begin now, during early development of this new, potentially large and transformative industry. We present strategies for ecological risk assessment of GM algae for commercial mass cultivation assuming that escape of GM algae into the environment is unavoidable. We consider the potential ecological, economic and health impacts of GM algae that persist in and alter natural ecosystems. Horizontal gene transfer with native organisms is of particular concern for certain traits, especially when cultivating GM cyanobacteria. In general, we predict that most target GM algal traits are unlikely to confer a selective advantage in nature, and thus would rapidly diminish, resulting in low but nonzero ecological risk. Genetic and mechanical containment, plus conditional matching of GM algal traits to unnatural cultivation conditions, would further reduce risk. These hypothetical predictions must be verified through rigorous ongoing monitoring and mesocosm experiments to minimize risk and foster public and regulatory acceptance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Algae; Biofuels; Ecological risk; Genetic modification; Horizontal gene transfer","algae; Cyanobacteria",,,,,,"Campbell, P.K., Beer, T., Batten, D., Life cycle assessment of biodiesel production from microalgae in ponds (2011) Bioresource Technology, 102, pp. 50-56; Hall, C.A.S., Benemann, J.R., Oil from algae?

The list of what could be affected by a GE crop is almost endless, when one considers all the possible organisms that it can potentially come in contact with.

James (2009) has provided an global overview of the current status of these crops: a total of roughly 134 million hectares (330 million acres) were grown worldwide in 2008; plantings of genetically engineered crops expanded from the the United States to 25 countries; North America was the largest producer of GE crops (the United States and Canada account for 64% of the world plantings) followed by South America with at least 34% of the hectarage (primarily in Argentina, Brazil, and paraguay); globally, 77% of the soybean, 49% of the cotton, and 26% of the corn crop was planted to GE varieties in 2009; in Asia, the leading producers were India and China, with more limited production in the philippines; while there was some production on all continents except Antarctica, the use has been more limited in Europe, Africa, and Australia. An estimated 14 million farmers planted GE crops in 2009, but because of differences in farm size, the great majority (90%) were in developing countries. © 2011 by Michigan State University.",,,,,,,,"Abate, T., Van Huis, A., Ampofo, J., Pest management strategies in traditional agriculture: An African perspective (2000) Annu.

Worldwide, Bt crops have provided effective control of target pests with fewer applications of insecticide, have increased yield and profitability for farmers, and have reduced risk to the environment and human health compared with non-Bt crops. Sustainable use of Bt crops requires risk management to limit the evolution of pest resistance and adverse effects of the Bt proteins to non-target organisms. Risks are managed by national regulatory authorities; however, the establishment of functional regulatory systems with the necessary scientific capacity is problematic in many developing countries, which hinders the wider deployment of Bt and other transgenic insect-resistant crops. Timely introduction of these crops may also be obstructed by inefficient implementation of international regulatory regimes, such as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB). Regulatory costs limit the number of insect-resistant crops that may be developed, and delay in the introduction of such crops may result in large opportunity costs. Implementing effective risk management while limiting these costs requires clear policy that defines the benefits and harms of cultivating transgenic crops and how those benefits and harms should be weighed in decision-making. Policy should lead to the development of regulatory frameworks that minimise the number of new data requirements and maximise the value of existing studies for risk assessment; costs will thereby be reduced, increasing the prospects for Bt crops, and transgenic insect-resistant crops generally, to improve food security in developing countries. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. & International Society for Plant Pathology.","Bacillus thuringiensis; Insect control; Regulation; Risk assessment; Transgenic crops","agricultural economics; bacterium; biopesticide; biosafety; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; developing world; food security; insect; nontarget organism; pest resistance; profitability; protein; regulatory framework; resistance management; risk assessment; sustainability; transgenic plant; yield response; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hexapoda",,,,,,"Agaisse, H., Lereclus, D., How does Bacillus thuringiensis produce so much insecticidal crystal protein?

The cry1Ia1 gene (from Bacillus thuringiensis) under the control of the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was transformed into the potato (Solanum tuberosum) cultivar Spunta to develop a cultivar with resistance to potato tuber moth for release in South Africa. Two transformation events, 'SpuntaG2' and 'SpuntaG3', were selected and subjected to extensive molecular analyses as required by the regulatory agencies of South Africa. Southern hybridization experiments indicated that 'SpuntaG2' and 'SpuntaG3' had one and three copies of the cry1Ia1 gene, respectively, and that the gene insertion was stable through multiple clonal generations. Furthermore, the sequence of the cry1Ia1 gene in 'SpuntaG2' was compared with the known sequence of the cry1Ia1 gene and found to be identical. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using primers for plasmid ''backbone'' genes demonstrated that 'SpuntaG2' contained no backbone plasmid genes, whereas 'SpuntaG3' contained several backbone plasmid genes. Therefore, further analyses were limited to 'SpuntaG2', and event-specific primers were developed for this cultivar. Analysis of the left and right border regions in 'SpuntaG2' demonstrated that the insertion of the cry1Ia1 gene did not disrupt any functional genes nor did it create new open reading frames that encoded proteins with a significant match to the non-redundant sequence database queried by the BLASTP program. Enzyme- linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA) tests indicate that the cry1Ia1 gene was expressed at a mean concentration of 2.24 μg·g-1 fresh weight in leaf tissue and 0.12 μg·g-1 fresh weight in tubers. This study demonstrates the extensive molecular characterization that is necessary to apply for deregulation of a genetically modified crop and these data have been used in a regulatory package for the general release of 'SpuntaG2'.","Deregulation; Insect; Transformation; Transgenic","Bacillus thuringiensis; Cauliflower mosaic virus; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Phthorimaea operculella; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"Altschul, S., Madden, T., Schäffer, A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Barton, K.A., Miller, M.J., Production of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal proteins in plants (1993) Transgenic plants, pp. 297-315. , In: S.D.

Previous studies have characterized 'SpuntaG2' at the molecular level and evaluated it for safety as a human food source. The objective here wasto determine the efficacyof'SpuntaG2' against the potato tuber moth in the field and in storage and to evaluate its agronomic performance. Efficacy trials at seven South African locations over 5 years indicated that 'SpuntaG2' gave complete control of potato tuber moth in the field and storage. The agronomic performance (tuber size and yield) of 'SpuntaG2' was not statistically different from 'Spunta' or was better than 'Spunta' at all locations/years with two exceptions. Three years of trials in Michigan further support these conclusions. Evaluations done during the 2006-07 South African season showed that 'SpuntaG2' did not differ from non-transgenic 'Spunta' for the following traits: maturity, growth habit, eye morphology, tuber size distribution, tuber shape, skin and flesh color, growth cracks, internal defects, specific gravity, chip color, cooking quality, disease resistance, and pollen fertility. Based on the results of these trials, it was concluded that 'SpuntaG2' provides the agronomic performance of 'Spunta' with the added benefit of resistance to potato tuber moth.","Bacillus thuringiensis; Cry1Ia1 gene; Deregulation; Phthorimaea operculella; Quality; South Africa; Transgenic","Bacillus thuringiensis; Lepidoptera; Phthorimaea operculella; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"Alexander, M.P., A versatile stain for pollen, fungi, yeast and bacteria (1980) Biotech.

Western blot analysis and biological activity assays showed molecular and functional equivalency between 'SpuntaG2'-derived Cry1Ia1 protein and bacteria-derived Cry1Ia1 protein. Comparison of the Cry1Ia1 amino acid sequence to known amino acid sequences revealed no significant homology to known toxins or known allergens. Acute toxicity studies using rodents were used to calculate an acceptable daily intake (ADI) value of 20 mg·kg-1 body weight per day. The ADI value was then used to calculate a margin of exposure (MOE) of 2,222,222, which is more than 22,000 times greater than the commonly used target MOE of 100. Digestibility and thermostability assays determined that Cry1Ia1 was fully digested within 30 s of exposure to pepsin and inactive after 3 to 4 minutes at 100°C, indicating that it would not be a potential allergen. Compositional analyses revealed no difference between 'SpuntaG2' and non-transgenic 'Spunta'. These results strongly indicate that the Cry1Ia protein and the transgenic potato 'SpuntaG2' is not a human health risk.","Bt; Insect resistance; NPTII; Phthorimaea operculella; Tuber moth","Bacteria (microorganisms); Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Phthorimaea operculella; Rodentia; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"(2010), http://www.agbios.com/dbase.php, AGBIOS, GM crop database. 1 Mar. 2010Altschul, S., Madden, T., Schäffer, A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Beck, E., Ludwig, G., Auerswald, E., Reiss, B., Schaller, H., Nucleotide sequence and exact localization of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene from transposon Tn5 (1982) Genetics, 19, pp. 327-336; Benford, D., (2000) The Acceptable Daily Intake: A Tool For Ensuring Food Safety, , International Life Sciences Institute, Washington, DC; (2003) Guideline For the Conduct of Food Safety Assessment of Foods Derived From Recombinant-DNA Plants CAC/GL, 45. , http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/index_en.jsp, Codex Alimentarius, 2003. 1 Mar. 2010; Delaney, B., Astwood, J., Cunny, H., Conn, R., Herouet-Guicheney, C., Macintosh, S., Meyer, L., Levine, M., Evaluation of protein safety in the context of agricultural biotechnology (2008) Food Chem.

In-country expertise is needed to make locally appropriate decisions. In April 2007, biosafety and biotechnology scientists, regulators, educators, and communicators from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, met to examine the status and needs of biosafety training and educational programs in East Africa. Workshop participants emphasized the importance of developing biosafety capacity within their countries and regionally. Key recommendations included identification of key biosafety curricular components for university students; collaboration among institutions and countries; development of informational materials for non-academic stakeholders and media; and organization of study tours for decision makers. It was emphasized that biosafety knowledge is important for all aspects of environmental health, food safety, and human and animal hygiene. Thus, development of biosafety expertise, policies and procedures can be a stepping stone to facilitate improved biosafety for all aspects of society and the environment. © 2009 by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.","Biotechnology; Environmental safety; Kenya; Tanzania; Uganda","Decision makers; East Africa; Educational program; Environmental health; Environmental safety; Food safety; Genetically engineered crops; Kenya; Stepping stone; Tanzania; Uganda; University students; Workshop participants; Crops; Biotechnology; Africa; article; biosafety; biotechnology; education program; environmental health; food safety; Kenya; policy; Tanzania; training; transgenic plant; Uganda; university student; Animalia",,,,,,"Andow, D.A., Hilbeck, A., Science-based risk assessment for nontarget effects of transgenic crops (2004) BioScience, 54 (7), pp. 637-649; Bates, S.L., Zhao, J.-Z., Roush, R.T., Shelton, A.M., Insect resistance management in GM crops: Past, present and future (2005) Nature Biotechnology, 23 (1), pp. 57-62. , DOI 10.1038/nbt1056; Baudo, M.M., Lyons, R., Powers, S., Pastori, G.M., Edwards, K.J., Holdsworth, M.J., Shewry, P.R., Transgenesis has less impact on the transcriptome of wheat grain than conventional breeding (2006) Plant Biotechnology Journal, 4 (4), pp. 369-380. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2006.00193.x; Brookes, G., Barfoot, P., Global impact of biotech crops: Socio-economic and environmental effects in the first ten years of commercial use (2006) AgBioForum, 9 (3), pp. 139-151. , http://www.agbioforum.org/v9n3/v9n3a02-brookes.pdf; Cerdeira, A.L., Duke, S.O., The current status and environmental impacts of glyphosate-resistant crops: A review (2006) Journal of Environmental Quality, 35 (5), pp. 1633-1658. , DOI 10.2134/jeq2005.0378; Chartier, J., Gabler, S., Risk communication and government (2001) Theory and Application for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [Online], 26p. , http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/publications/riscomm/ riscomme.shtml, Canadian Food Inspection Agency Public and Regulatory Affairs Branch, [cited 04 June 2008] Available from Internet:; (2004) Foods Derived from Biotechnology, , http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5819e/y5819e00.htm, CODEX Alimentarius.

Despite the socio-economic and environmental benefits of the technology, further development is being hampered by differences in national regulatory frameworks relating to research, biosafety, and to the trade and use of GM crops. The biosafety regulations in different countries are based on five main international instruments that influence the development of national biosafety systems in terms of field trial permit requirements, risk assessment criteria, labeling, traceability, transparency, public awareness, post-monitoring and import regulations. The global harmonization of data collection, testing procedures and information exchange would help to remove artificial trade barriers, expedite the adoption of GM crops, foster technology transfer and protect developing countries from exploitation, instilling confidence and bringing the benefits of GM products to the consumer. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","GM crops; Precautionary approach; Regulatory process; Risk assessment; Transgenic plants",,,,,,,"(2008) GM Crop Database, , http://www.agbios.com/dbase.php, Accessed 11th August 2008; (2008) Summary of Regulatory Approvals.

Transgenic virus-resistant Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera var. ovifera L. (squash) cultivars have been commercialized, and may be cultivated in close proximity to cross-compatible wild, free-living relatives (C. pepo subsp. pepo vars. ozarkana and texana). Therefore, the potential impact of these virus resistance transgenes was studied by surveying the incidence and fluctuations of virus infection (as assayed by ELISA), virus symptoms (which may not be seen in an infected plant) and population size in forty-three free-living C. pepo populations in Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Ten of these populations were studied over three consecutive seasons. Depending on the year, 61% to 78% percent of the populations had at least one individual infected by at CMV, ZYMV or WMV2, but the median incidence of infection within populations was 13%. The observed infection level in free-living populations was consistent with levels defined as ""low"" in field plot experiments conducted by others, leading to the conclusion that transgenic virus resistance should not provide a significant fitness advantage to the free-living populations examined. Viral symptoms were detected in only 2% of plants observed, indicating that severity of viral infection was low. CMV, ZYMV, and WMV2 were not the only viruses infecting these populations, further reducing the likelihood that resistance to these viruses would release populations from constraints imposed by virus diseases. © 2008 ISBR EDP Sciences.","Cucurbita pepo; Gene flow; Introgression; Populations; Transgenic; Virus resistance","article; gene flow; genetics; incidence; isolation and purification; Mosaic virus; plant disease; population density; squash; transgene; United States; virology; Cucumovirus; Cucurbita; Gene Flow; Incidence; Plant Diseases; Population Density; Transgenes; United States; Cucurbita pepo; Zucchini yellow mosaic virus",,,,,,"Arias, D.M., Rieseberg, L.H., Gene flow between cultivated and wild sunflower (1994) Theor.

It adapts the tiered approach to risk assessment that is used internationally within regulatory toxicology and environmental sciences. The approach focuses on the formulation and testing of clearly stated risk hypotheses, making maximum use of available data and using formal decision guidelines to progress between testing stages (or tiers). It is intended to provide guidance to regulatory agencies that are currently developing their own NTA risk assessment guidelines for IRGM crops and to help harmonize regulatory requirements between different countries and different regions of the world. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Biodiversity; Environmental impact assessments; Harmonic analysis; Insect control; Risk assessment; Toxic materials; Risk assessment guidelines; Toxicology; Crops; Cry1Ab toxin; arthropod; crop; insect; nonhuman; practice guideline; priority journal; protein analysis; review; risk assessment; risk factor; Animals; Arthropods; Bacterial Toxins; Gene Targeting; Pest Control, Biological; Plants, Genetically Modified; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Arthropoda; Hexapoda",,"Bacterial Toxins",,,,"James, C.

Potentially, strategic environmental assessment (SEA) may be used as part of an environmental management system to introduce mainstreaming of environmental considerations in the policy research and priority-setting process of development organizations to help achieve international development goals. This paper sets out a possible biotechnology SEA process that integrates qualitative and quantitative assessments with a focus on risk assessment and management within the SEA and policy environmental assessment frameworks. It uses the International Association for Impact Assessment six performance criteria for SEAs: integration; sustainability; focus; accountability; participation; and iteration. © IAIA 2006.","Genetically modified; GMO; Living modified organism; LMO; Risk; Strategic environmental assessment","crop; environmental assessment; environmental management; genetically modified organism; risk assessment; strategic approach",,,,,,"Bailey, J., Dixon, J.E., Policy environmental assessment (1999) Handbook of Environmental Impact Assessment, 2. , ed.

Typically, these populations have been assumed to represent escaped forms of cultivated vars. chito or dudaim, and have been labelled accordingly, or more rarely as var. agrestis. To clarify the origins of New World melons, North American, chito, and dudaim accessions were studied with respect to 45 quantitative and 10 qualitative morphological and physiological characters. Also collected were RAPD and SSR data for 42 North American populations, 10 Cultivar accessions of vars. chito and dudaim, 10 other small-fruited Old World accessions, and 4 other varieties of C. melovars. conomon, flexuosus, inodorus, and cantalupensis. All data revealed that New World populations are distinct, and should be classified as ssp. agrestis var. texanus Naudin. This variety showed the greatest genetic affinities to var. chito and to cultivars from Eastern Asia, including var. conomon.","Cucumis melo; Melon; RAPD; SSR; Var. chito; Var. dudaim","Citrullus lanatus; Cucumis; Cucumis melo; Cucumis sativus; Cucurbitaceae; Embryophyta",,,,,,"Bailey, L.H., (1937) The Garden of Gourds, , MacMillan Co., New York; Bailey, L.H., Species of Cucurbita (1943) Gentes Herb., 6 (5), pp. 265-322; Barlow, C., (2000) The Ghosts of Evolution: Nonsensical Fruit, Missing Partners, and Other Ecological Anachronisms, , Basic Books, New York City; Bobrov, E.G., Federov, A.A., Gorshkova, S.G., Vasil' chenko, I.T., Dipsacaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Campanulaceae (1972) Flora of the U.S.S.R., , Shishkin B.

In squash (Cucurbita pepo), free-living populations are diverse in their distributions, ecologies, histories, and genetic and phenotypic compositions. As part of the effort to understand this diversity, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) data were collected from 37 wild or weedy populations and 16 cultivars, which together represented all infraspecific taxa of C. pepo. Twenty-six primers yielded 70 scorable and variable markers. The presence/absence of bands for these markers produced a data matrix which was analyzed using cluster analysis. The analysis confirmed the relationships among infraspecific taxa that had been revealed, in part, in previous genetic analyses (e.g., isozymes, chloroplast DNA restriction-site mutations, inter simple sequence repeats). Also supported were findings of varying degrees of gene flow from cultivars into free-living populations. Some of the RAPD variation in subsp. ovifera var. ozarkana populations was found to be correlated with the distribution of the drainage systems along which these populations are dispersed. Finally, the RAPD results support the idea that transgenic gene flow experiments with free-living populations should consider using representatives from each of the three free-living taxa, as well as from genetically or ecologically distinct populations within these taxa.",,"Cucumis sativus; Cucurbita; Cucurbita pepo; Cucurbitaceae; Embryophyta; Pepo",,,,,,"Andres, T., Cucurbita fraterna, the closest wild relative and progenitor of C. pepo (1987) Cucurbit Genetics Cooperative Report, 10, pp. 69-71; Asch, D.L., Asch, N.B., Archaeobotany (1992) Geoarchaeology of the Ambrose Flick site, , ed.

Transgenic squash lines with both coat protein (CP) genes of the melon strain of SqMV were produced and crossed with nontransgenic squash. Further greenhouse, screenhouse and field tests were done with R1 plants from three independent lines that showed susceptible, recovery, or resistant phenotypes after inoculations with SqMV. Nearly all inoculated plants of the resistant line (SqMV-127) were resistant under greenhouse and field conditions and less so under screenhouse conditions. Plants of the recovery phenotype line (SqMV-3) were susceptible when inoculated at the cotyledon stage but leaves that developed later did not show symptoms. The susceptible line (SqMV-22) developed symptoms that persisted and spread throughout the plant. Plants were also analyzed for transcription rates of the CP transgenes and steady state transgene RNA levels. Results showed that the resistant line SqMV-127 displayed post-transcriptional silencing of the CP transgene as evidenced by high transcription rates but concomitant low accumulation of transgene transcripts. This is the first report on the development of transgenic squash that are resistant to SqMV.","Cosuppression; Field test; Gene silencing; Pathogen-derived resistance; SqMV; Transgenic squash","chimeric gene; coat protein; disease resistance; genetic line; inoculation; phenotype; squash mosaic comovirus; squash; transcription termination; transgene; transgenic plant; virus infection",,,,,,"Allmansberger, R., Brau, B., Piepersberg, W., Genes for gentamincin-(3)-N-acetyl-transferases III and IV.

Resistance was evaluated under high disease pressure achieved by mechanical inoculations and/or natural challenge inoculations by indigenous aphid vectors. Across five different trials, homozygous plants were highly resistant in that they never developed systemic symptoms as did the nontransformed plants but showed few symptomatic leaves confined close to the vine tips. Hemizygous plants exhibited a significant delay (2-3 weeks) in the onset of disease compared to control plants but had systemic symptoms 9-10 weeks after transplanting to the field. Importantly, ELISA data revealed that transgenic plants reduced the incidence of mixed infections. Only 8% of the homozygous and 33% of the hemizygous plants were infected by two or three viruses while 99% of the nontransformed plants were mixed infected. This performance is of epidemiological significance. In addition, control plants were severely stunted (44% reduction in shoot length) and had poor fruit yield (62% loss) compared to transgenic plants, and most of their fruits (60%) were unmarketable. Remarkably, hemizygous plants yielded 7.4 times more marketable fruits than control plants, thus suggesting a potential commercial performance. This is the first report on extensive field trials designed to assess the resistance to mixed infection by CMV, ZYMV, and WMV-2, and to evaluate the yield of commercial quality cantaloupes that are genetically engineered. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Coat protein-mediated protection;

In a transgenic lettuce line, post-transcriptional gene silencing was activated at a relatively earlier developmental stage in homozygous than in hemizygous progenies. As a result, the homozygous progenies generally showed a uniform suppression of N protein accumulation and consequently high levels of virus resistance in all leaves of the silenced plants. In contrast, N protein accumulated at high levels in the lower leaves of the hemizygous progenies and at much reduced levels (due to transgene silencing) in the successive leaves, resulting in moderate levels of virus resistance.

Progeny from lines transformed with single or multiple CP gene constructs were tested for virus resistance under field conditions, and exhibited varying levels of resistance to infection by CMV, WMV 2 or ZYMV. Most transgenic lines remained nonsymptomatic throughout the growing seasons and produced marketable fruits, while other lines showed a delay in the onset of symptoms and/or a reduction in symptom severity. A few lines failed to display any level of resistance. Depending on the CP gene used, 40 to 95% of the transgenic lines containing single CP constructs of either CMV, WMV 2 or ZYMV were resistant to the virus from which the CP gene was derived. Transgenic lines transformed with a double CP construct containing the CP genes from CMV and WMV 2, designated CW, displayed high level of resistance to CMV and WMV 2. A transgenic line, designated ZW-20, which contained the CP genes from ZYMV and WMV 2 displayed excellent resistance to ZYMV and WMV 2 in that most of the plants showed complete resistance. A few plants developed localized chlorotic dots or blotches, yet fruits remained asymptomatic. Southern blot analysis revealed that the CP inserts of some resistant plants of line ZW-20 were no longer linked to the neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) gene. This loss of linkage allowed the marker gene to be separated from the virus resistance trait by Mendelian segregation. Further analysis of these plants showed that they contained multiple WMV 2 inserts which were designated B and H, the latter consisting of two hybridization signals. Analysis of inoculated plants showed that plants with the H inserts were symptomless or developed only chlorotic dots, while those without the H insert developed more prominent chlorotic blotches. In addition to lines with resistance to two viruses, a line with resistance to three viruses was also identified. Transgenic line CZW-3, transformed with the triple CP construct containing the CMV, WMV 2 and ZYMV CP genes, exhibited resistance to all three viruses. These two transgenic inbred lines, ZW-20 and CZW-3, have allowed for the development of commercial squash hybrids with multiple virus resistance.",,"Cucurbita pepo; Agrobacterium; Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus; Cucumber mosaic virus; Cucumis sativus; Cucurbita pepo var. melopepo; Watermelon mosaic virus; Zucchini yellow mosaic virus; coat protein; neomycin; phosphotransferase; article; controlled study; Cucumber mosaic virus; fruit; gene segregation; genetic linkage; hybridization; inbred strain; marker gene; Mosaic virus; nonhuman; Rhizobium; Southern blotting; transgenic plant; virus gene; virus resistance; virus transformation",,,,,,,"Tricoll, D.M.; Asgrow Seed Company, Kalamazoo, MI 49002, United States",,,,,,,,0733222X,,BTCHD,,"English","BIOTECHNOLOGY",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028788452

Comparison of the coat protein amino acid sequence with those of other potyviruses shows perfectly conserved amino acids which may have functional significance.",,"amino acid analysis; article; cell culture; genetic engineering; molecular cloning; mosaic virus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; plant; plant virus; priority journal; virus strain; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Capsid; Cloning, Molecular; Comparative Study; DNA, Viral; Molecular Sequence Data; Nuclear Proteins; Plant Viruses; Restriction Mapping; Viral Proteins; Carica papaya; Papaya ringspot virus; Potyvirus; Suid herpesvirus 1","GENBANK: D00594, D00595","DNA, Viral; Nuclear Proteins; Viral Proteins",,,,,,,,,,,,,00221317,,JGVIA,2303800,"English","J.

We have constructed cDNA clones of the coat protein coding regions of CMV strains C and WL, and have compared the nucleotide sequences of the RNA 3 intergenic region, coat protein gene, and 3' untranslated region with published CMV sequences from the same regions of the Q, D and Y strains. These comparisons show that the C and WL strains belong to different CMV subgroups, and that the subgroups are more closely related in sequence than suggested by previous nucleic acid hybridization studies.",,"DNA; virus DNA; virus RNA; amino acid sequence; article; classification; codon; comparative study; genetic recombination; genetics; isolation and purification; methodology; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; Mosaic virus; nucleotide sequence; virus capsid; virus gene; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Capsid; Cloning, Molecular; Codon; Comparative Study; DNA; DNA, Viral; Genes, Viral; Molecular Sequence Data; Mosaic Viruses; Recombination, Genetic; RNA, Viral",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; Codon; DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, Viral; RNA, Viral",,,,,"Quemada, H.",,,,,,,,00221317,,,2732712,"English","J Gen Virol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024670207

Methylation of the internal cytosine (CmeCGG) prevents digestion by HpaII but allows digestions by MspI. Suspension cultures were prepared from soybean plants and the DNA from these cultures was examined for the susceptibility of 5S RNA genes to digestion by MspI and HpaII. 5S genes from DNA extracted from intact plants can be partially digested with MspI but not at all by HpaII. In contrast, shortly after cells were cultured the 5S RNA could be hydrolyzed by both HpaII and MspI. After prolonged cell culture, the 5S genes from some cell lines were found to have become partially or even completely resistant to HpaII digestion. The results suggest that lack of methylation can occur when cells are cultured and that such methylation may play a role in the heritable changes observed in cell culture. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,"Amasino, R.M., Powell, A.L.T., Gordon, M.P., (1984) Molec Gen Genet, 197, pp. 437-446; BRL focus 5:6 (1983)Busslinger, M., de Boer, S., Wright, S., Groveld, I.G., Flavell, R.A., (1983) Nucleic Acids Res, 11, pp. 3559-3569; Chaleff, R.S., (1981) Genetics of higher plants.
