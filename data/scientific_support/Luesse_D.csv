Here, we describe methods for the proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. Extraction protocols are provided for isolation of soluble, plasma membrane, and tonoplast proteins. In addition, basic analysis and quality metrics for MS/MS data are discussed. The protocols outlined have the potential to unlock new avenues of research that are not possible through basic genetics or transcriptomic approaches. By combining proteomic information with known gene regulatory patterns, researchers can gain a complete picture of how molecular pathways, such as those required for gravitropism, are initiated, regulated, and terminated. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","Arabidopsis; Gravitropism; Gravity; ITRAQ; Membrane proteins; Posttranslational modifications; Protein extraction; Proteomics; Spaceflight","protein; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; cell membrane; controlled study; gene control; genetics; gravitropism; nonhuman; plant growth; plant tissue; priority journal; protein analysis; protein isolation; proteomics; tonoplast; transcriptomics; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"protein, 67254-75-5",,,,"Kimbrough, J., Salinas-Mondragon, R., Boss, W., Brown, C., Sederoff, H., The fast and transient transcriptional network of gravity and mechanical stimulation in the Arabidopsis root apex (2004) Plant Physiol, 136, pp. 2790-2805; Paul, A.-L., Popp, M.P., Gurley, W.B., Guy, C., Norwood, K.L., Ferl, R.J., Arabidopsis gene expression patterns are altered during spaceflight (2005) Adv Space Res, 36, pp. 1175-1181; Salmi, M.L., Roux, S.J., Gene expression changes induced by space flight in single-cells of the fern Ceratopteris richardii (2008) Planta, 229, pp. 151-159; Shagimardanova, E.I., Gusev, O.A., Sychev, V.N., Levinskikh, M.A., Sharipova, M.R., Il’Inskaya, O.N., Bingham, G., Expression of stress response genes in barley Hordeum vulgare in a spaceflight environment (2010) Mol Biol, 44, pp. 734-740; Paul, A.-L., Manak, M.S., Mayfield, J.D., Reyes, M.F., Gurley, W.B., Ferl, R.J., Parabolic flight induces changes in gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana (2011) Astrobiology, 11, pp. 743-758; Paul, A.-L., Zupanska, A.K., Ostrow, D.T., Zhang, Y., Sun, Y., Li, J.-L., Spaceflight transcriptomes: Unique responses to a novel environment (2012) Astrobiology, 12, pp. 40-56; Nadella, V., Hildenbrand, C.D., Wyatt, S.E., Transcription profiling of the gps1 mutant of Arabidopsis (2006) Gravit Space Biol, 20, pp. 155-156; Kamada, M., Takaoki, M., Ishioka, N., Gravity-regulated proteins of Arabidopsis and cucumber seedlings detected by 2-D electrophoresis (2004) Biol Sci Space, 18, pp. 156-157; Yang, H., Richter, G.L., Wang, X., Mlodzinska, E., Carraro, N., Ma, G., Sterols and sphingolipids differentially function in trafficking of the Arabidopsis ABCB19 auxin transporter (2013) Plant J, 74, pp. 37-47; Nesvizhskii, A.I., Keller, A., Kolker, E., Aebersold, R., A statistical model for identifying proteins by tandem mass spectrometry (2003) Anal Chem, 75, pp. 4646-4658; Schenck, C.A., Nadella, V., Clay, S.L., Lindner, J., Abrams, Z., Wyatt, S.E., A proteomics approach identifies novel proteins involved in gravitropic signal transduction (2013) Am J Bot, 100, pp. 194-202; Hurkman, W., Tanaka, C., Solubilization of plant membrane proteins for analysis by twodimensional gel electrophoresis (1986) Plant Physiol, 81, pp. 802-806; Whiteman, S.A., Nuhse, T.S., Ashford, D.A., Sanders, D., Maathuis, F., A proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of Oryza sativa plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane (2008) Plant J, 56, pp. 146-156; Dunkley, T., Watson, R., Griffin, J.L., Dupree, P., Lilley, K.S., Localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging (2004) Mol Cell Proteomics, 4, pp. 1128-1134; Westermeier, R., Naven, T., (2002) Expression Proteomics, Proteomics in Practice, , Wiley- VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods: We have identifi ed mutants in the GERANYLGERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 (GGPS1) gene, which encodes the major plastid-localized enzyme geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in Arabidopsis thaliana. Key results: Two T-DNA insertion mutant alleles (ggps1-2 and ggps1-3) were found to result in seedling-lethal albino and embryo-lethal phenotypes, respectively, indicating that GGPS1 is an essential gene. We also identifi ed a temperature-sensitive leaf variegation mutant (ggps1-1) in A. thaliana that is caused by a point mutation. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were reduced in ggps1-1 white tissues as compared with green tissues. Phenotypes typically associated with a reduction in gibberellic acid were not seen, suggesting that gibberellic acid biosynthesis is not noticeably altered in the mutant. In contrast to other variegated mutants, the ggps1-1 green sector photosynthetic rate was not elevated relative to wild-type tissues. Chloroplast development in green sectors of variegated leaves appeared normal, whereas cells in white sectors contained abnormal plastids with numerous electron translucent bodies and poorly developed internal membranes. Conclusions: Our results indicate that GGPS1 is a key gene in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Brassicaceae; Chlorophyll; Ggps; Isoprenoid; Mep pathway; Methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway; Photosynthesis; Variegation","abscisic acid; carotenoid; chlorophyll; chloroplast; dicotyledon; electron; embryo; enzyme activity; hormone; isoprenoid; membrane; mutation; phenotype; photosynthesis; plastid; Arabidopsis protein; chlorophyll; GGPS1 protein, Arabidopsis; isoprenoid; phytohormone; pigment; transferase; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; article; Brassicaceae; chemistry; chloroplast; cytology; drug effect; enzymology; flower; gene expression regulation; genetics; germination; GGPS; growth, development and aging; MEP pathway; metabolism; methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway; mutation; phenotype; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant leaf; temperature; variegation; Arabidopsis thaliana; Brassicaceae; chlorophyll; GGPS; isoprenoid; MEP pathway; methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway; photosynthesis; variegation; Alkyl and Aryl Transferases; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chloroplasts; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germination; Hypocotyl; Mutation; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Pigments, Biological; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Temperature",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; transferase, 9047-61-4",,,,"Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with ImageJ (2004) Biophotonics International, 11, pp. 36-42; Alabadí, D., Gil, J., Blázquez, M.A., García-Martínez, J.L., Gibberellins repress photomorphogenesis in darkness (2004) Plant Physiology, 134, pp. 1050-1057; Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Kim, C.J., Chen, H., Shinn, P., Stevenson, D.K., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Aluru, M.R., Rodermel, S.R., Control of chloroplast redox by the IMMUTANS terminal oxidase (2004) Physiologia Plantarum, 120, pp. 4-11; Aluru, M.R., Stessman, D.J., Spalding, M.H., Rodermel, S.R., Alterations in photosynthesis in Arabidopsis lacking IMMUTANS, a chloroplast terminal oxidase (2007) Photosynthesis Research, 91, pp. 11-23; Ashby, M.N., Edwards, P.A., Elucidation of the defi ciency in two yeast coenzyme Q mutants (1990) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 265, pp. 13157-13164; Assmann, S., Enhancement of the stomatal response to blue light by red light, reduced intercellular concentrations of CO 2, and low vapor pressure differences (1988) Plant Physiology, 87, pp. 226-231; Bai, M.Y., Shang, J.X., Oh, E., Fan, M., Bai, Y., Zentella, R., Sun, T.P., Ang, Z.Y.W., Brassinosteroid, gibberellin and phytochrome impinge on a common transcription module in (2012) Arabidopsis.Nature Cell Biology, 14, pp. 810-817; Blázquez, M.A., Green, R., Nilsson, O., Sussman, M.R., Weigel, D., Gibberellins promote fl owering of Arabidopsis by activating the LEAFY promoter (1998) Plant Cell, 10, pp. 791-800; Bouvier, F., Rahier, A., Camara, B., Biogenesis, molecular regulation and function of plant isoprenoids (2005) Progress In Lipid Research, 44, pp. 357-429; Budziszewski, G.J., Lewis, S.P., Glover, L.W., Reineke, J., Jones, G., Ziemnik, L.S., Arabidopsis genes essential for seedling viability: Isolation of insertional mutants and molecular cloning (2001) Genetics, 159, pp. 1765-1778; Carol, P., Stevenson, D., Bisanz, C., Breitenbach, J., Sandmann, G., Mache, R., Mutations in the Arabidopsis gene IMMUTANS cause a variegated phenotype by inactivating a chloroplast terminal oxidase associated with phytoene desaturation (1999) Plant Cell, 11, pp. 57-68; Charuvi, D., Kiss, V., Nevo, R., Himoni, E.S., Adam, Z., Eich, Z.R., Gain and loss of photosynthetic membranes during plastid differentiation in the shoot apex of (2012) Arabidopsis.

The regulation of these chloroplast movements involves members of both the phototropin and phytochrome families of photoreceptors. Examination of fluence-rate response dependencies in phot1 and phot2 mutants revealed that although both photoreceptors are capable of inducing chloroplast accumulation under low-light conditions, the signals from these photoreceptors appear to be antagonistic. Chloroplast movements in wild-type plants were intermediate between those of the single phot mutants, consistent with each operating through separate signalling cascades. Mutants in phot2 showed transient chloroplast avoidance responses upon exposure to intense blue light, and slow but sustained chloroplast avoidance under intense white light, indicating that in the absence of phot2, phot1 is capable of generating both a low and a high-light response signal. Mutations in phytochrome B (phyB) caused an enhanced avoidance response at intermediate and high light intensities. Examination of phyB, phot1phyB, and phot2phyB mutants indicated that this enhancement is caused by PhyB inhibition of the high-light avoidance response in wild-type plants. In addition, our results suggest that the inhibition by PhyB is not exclusive to either of the phot1 or phot2 signalling pathways. © 2010 The Author.","Arabidopsis thaliana; chloroplast movement; phototropin;

Although cryptochromes and phytochromes are not required for phototropic induction, these photoreceptors do modulate the magnitude of curvature resulting from phototropin activation. Modulatory increases in the magnitude of phototropic curvature have been termed ""enhancement."" Here, we show that phototropic enhancement is primarily a phytochrome A (phyA)-dependent red/far-red-reversible low fluence response. This phyA-dependent response is genetically separable from the basal phototropin-dependent response, as demonstrated by its retention under extended irradiation conditions in the nph4 mutant background, which normally lacks the basal BL-induced response. It is interesting that the nph4 mutants fail to exhibit the basal phototropin-dependent and phyA-dependent enhancement responses under limiting light conditions. Given that NPH4 encodes a transcriptional activator, auxin response factor 7 (ARF7), we hypothesize that the ultimate target(s) of phyA action during the phototropic enhancement response is a rate-limiting ARF-containing transcriptional complex in which the constituent ARFs can vary in identity or activity depending upon the irradiation condition.",,"auxin; blue light; etiolation; far red light; light intensity; mutant; phototropism; phytochrome; plant response; plant; seedling; transcription factor; Irradiation; Mutagenesis; Physiology; Seed; Phototropism; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; Drosophila Proteins; Eye Proteins; Flavoproteins; Indoleacetic Acids; Photoreceptors, Invertebrate; Phototropism; Phytochrome; Phytochrome A; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; cryptochrome protein, Drosophila; cryptochrome; DNA Primers; Drosophila Proteins; Eye Proteins; Flavoproteins; Indoleacetic Acids; PHYA protein, Arabidopsis; Phytochrome A; Phytochrome, 11121-56-5; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled",,,,"Batschauer, A., Light perception in higher plants (1999) Cell Mol Life Sci, 55, pp. 153-165; Behringer, F.J., Davies, P.J., Indole-3-acetic acid levels after phytochrome-mediated changes in the stem elongation rate of dark- and light-grown Pisum seedlings (1992) Planta, 188, pp. 85-92; Boylan, M.T., Quail, P.H., Phytochrome A overexpression inhibits hypocotyl elongation in transgenic Arabidopsis (1991) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 88, pp. 10806-10810; Casal, J.J., Phytochromes, cryptochromes, phototropin: Photoreceptor interactions in plants (2000) Photochem Photobiol, 71, pp. 1-11; Chon, H.P., Briggs, W.R., Effect of red light on the phototropic sensitivity of corn coleoptiles (1966) Plant Physiol, 41, pp. 1715-1724; Christie, J.M., Reymond, P., Powell, G.K., Bernasconi, P., Raibekas, A.A., Liscum, E., Briggs, W.R., Arabidopsis NPH1: A flavoprotein with the properties of a photoreceptor for phototropism (1998) Science, 282, pp. 1698-1701; Christie, J.M., Salomon, M., Nozue, K., Wada, M., Briggs, W.R., LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage) domains of the blue-light photoreceptor phototropin (nph1): Binding sites for the chromophore flavin mononucleotide (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 8779-8783; Clack, T., Mathews, S., Sharrock, R.A., The phytochrome apoprotein family in Arabidopsis is encoded by five genes: The sequences and expression of PHYD and PHYE (1994) Plant Mol Biol, 25, pp. 413-427; Clough, R.C., Jordan-Beebe, E.T., Lohman, K.N., Marita, J.M., Walker, J.M., Gatz, C., Vierstra, R.D., Sequences within both the N- and C-terminal domains of phytochrome a are required for PFR ubiquitination and degradation (1999) Plant J, 17, pp. 155-167; Colón-Carmona, A., Chen, D.L., Yeh, K.-C., Abel, S., Aux/IAA proteins are phosphorylated by phytochrome in vitro (2000) Plant Physiol, 124, pp. 1739-1751; Eleizer, J., Morris, D.A., Cell length, light and 14C-labeled indol-3yl-acetic acid transport in Pisum sativum L. and Phaseolus vulgaris L.

Two plant hormones, auxin and ethylene, have been implicated as regulators Of differential growth responses; however, the mechanisms by which they elicit their effects remain largely unknown. Here, we describe isolation of the NPH4 gene of Arabidopsis, which is conditionally required for differential growth responses of aerial tissues, and we report that NPH4 encodes the auxin-regulated transcriptional activator ARF7. The phenotypes of nph4 mutants, which include multiple differential growth defects associated with reduced auxin responsiveness, including impaired auxin-induced gene expression, are consistent with the predicted loss of function of a transcriptional activator, and these phenotypes indicate that auxin-dependent Changes in gene transcription are prerequisite for proper organ bending responses. Although NPH4/ARF7 appears to be a major regulator of differential growth, it is not the sole regulator because phenotypes of nph4 null mutants were suppressed by application of ethylene. This latter finding illustrates the intimate connection between auxin and ethylene in the control of growth in higher plants.",,"ethylene; ethylene derivative; indoleacetic acid derivative; primer DNA; Arabidopsis; article; gene; genetics; gravitropism; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular cloning; mutation; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; physiology; regulator gene; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA Primers; Ethylenes; Genes, Plant; Genes, Regulator; Gravitropism; Indoleacetic Acids; Mutation; Phenotype; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta",,"DNA Primers; ethylene, 74-85-1; Ethylenes; Indoleacetic Acids",,,,"Abel, S., Theologis, A., Early genes and auxin action (1996) Plant Physiol., 111, pp. 9-17; Alonso, J.M., Hirayama, T., Roman, G., Nourizadeh, S., Ecker, J.R., EIN2, a bifunctional transducer of ethylene and stress responses in Arabidopsis (1999) Science, 284, pp. 2148-2152; Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Millar, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402; Ausubel, F., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1995) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, , New York: John Wiley; Bartel, B., Fink, G.R., Differential regulation of an auxin-producing nitrilase gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana (1994) Proc.
