Extrinsic signals, such as Wnt and TGF-β pathways, activate combinatorial codes of transcription factors that are responsible for generating a pattern of discrete domains of dorsal progenitors (dp). These progenitors will give rise to distinct dorsal interneurons (dI). The Wnt/ βcatenin signaling pathway controls specification of dp/dI1-3 progenitors and interneurons. According to the current model in the field, Wnt/βcatenin activity seems to act in a graded fashion in the spinal cord, as different relative levels determine the identity of adjacent progenitors. However, it is not clear how this activity gradient is controlled and how the identities of dI1-3 are differentially regulated by Wnt signalling. We have determined that two SoxD transcription factors, Sox5 and Sox6, are expressed in restricted domains of dorsal progenitors in the neural tube. Using gain- and loss-of function approaches in chicken embryos, we have established that Sox5 controls cell fate specification of dp2 and dp3 progenitors and, as a result, controls the correct number of the corresponding dorsal interneurons (dI2 and dI3). Furthermore, Sox5 exerts its function by restricting dorsally Wnt signaling activity via direct transcriptional induction of the negative Wnt pathway regulator Axin2. By that way, Sox5 acts as a Wnt pathway modulator that contributes to sharpen the dorsal gradient of Wnt/βcatenin activity to control the distinction of two functionally distinct types of interneurons, dI2 and dI3 involved in the somatosensory relay. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Chick embryo;

This is of particular interest when mutations lead to lethal in vivo phenotypes. Although the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolysis are regarded as key elements of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, the physiological function of APP is not well understood and mice lacking App and the related gene Aplp2 die early postnatally without any obvious histopathological abnormalities. Here we show that glutamatergic neurons differentiated from ESCs lacking both genes reveal a decreased expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) both at the mRNA and protein level, as well as a reduced uptake and/or release of glutamate. Blocking γ-secretase cleavage of APP in wild-type neurons resulted in a similar decrease of VGLUT2 expression, whereas VGLUT2 levels could be restored in App-/-Aplp2-/- neurons by a construct encompassing the C-terminal intracellular domain of APP. Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal organotypic slice cultures prepared from corresponding mutant mice corroborated these observations. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis of the differentiated App-/-Aplp2-/- neurons identified dysregulation of additional genes involved in synaptic transmission pathways. Our results indicate a significant functional role of APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) in the development of synaptic function by the regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Differentiation of ESCs into homogeneous populations thus represents a new opportunity to explore gene function and to dissect signaling pathways in neurons. ©AlphaMed Press.","Amyloid precursor protein;

However, little is known about Sox5 function in neural crest derivatives such as the peripheral sensory nervous system. We have analysed the embryonic expression of Sox5 during chick cranial ganglia development, from the stages of ganglia condensation to those of differentiation. During this period, Sox5 expression is maintained in the crest-derived satellite glial cells in all the cranial ganglia. In contrast, Sox5 is only transiently expressed in a subpopulation of differentiating neurons of both neural crest and placode origin. This detailed analysis provides a good base to dissect the possible role of Sox5 in neural cell fate determination by future functional approaches. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Chick; Cranial ganglia; Neural crest; Satellite glia; Sox10; Sox5","high mobility group B protein; protein soxd; transcription factor Sox5; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell fate; cell subpopulation; chick embryo; developmental stage; embryo; embryo development; ganglion; glia cell; nerve cell differentiation; neural crest; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; sensory nerve; Animals; Brain; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Chick Embryo; DNA-Binding Proteins; Ganglia; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High Mobility Group Proteins; HMGB Proteins; Immunohistochemistry; Neural Crest; Neuroglia; Transcription Factors; Trigeminal Ganglion",,"high mobility group B protein, 431548-19-5; DNA-Binding Proteins; HMGB Proteins; High Mobility Group Proteins; Sox-10 transcription factor; Transcription Factors",,,,"Ayer-Le Lievre, C.S., Le Douarin, N.M., The early development of cranial sensory ganglia and the potentialities of their component cells studied in quail-chick chimeras (1982) Dev Biol, 94, pp. 291-310; Baker, C.V., Bronner-Fraser, M., Vertebrate cranial placodes I.

LSox5 is a member of the group D Sox factors that, in conjunction with Sox6 and Sox9, promotes chondrogenesis by activating the expression of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix molecules. We have cloned the chicken homologue of LSox5 and found that it is initially expressed in the premigratory and migratory neural crest after Slug and FoxD3. Subsequently, and expression of LSox5 is maintained in cephalic crest derivatives, and it appears to be required for the development of the glial lineage, the Schwann cells and satellite glia in cranial ganglia. Misexpression of LSox5 in the cephalic neural tube activated RhoB expression throughout the dorsoventral axis. Furthermore, the prolonged forced expression of LSox5 enlarged the dorsal territory in which the neural crest is generated, extended the 'temporal window' of neural crest segregation, and led to an overproduction of neural crest cells in cephalic regions. In addition to HNK-1, the additional neural crest cells expressed putative upstream markers (Slug, FoxD3) indicating that a regulatory feedback mechanism may operate during neural crest generation. Thus, our data show that in addition to the SoxE genes (Sox9 and Sox10) a SoxD gene (Sox5) also participates in neural crest development and that a cooperative interaction may operate during neural crest generation, as seen during the formation of cartilage.","Chick; LSox5; Neural crest; Peripheral glia; RhoB","cell marker; high mobility group protein; transcription factor; transcription factor LSox5; transcription factor RhoB; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; cartilage; cell lineage; cell maturation; chicken; controlled study; data analysis; embryo development; feedback system; ganglion; glia cell; molecular cloning; neural crest; neural crest cell; neural tube; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; satellite cell; Schwann cell; sequence homology; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cell Movement; Chick Embryo; DNA-Binding Proteins; Enzyme Activation; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; High Mobility Group Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Neural Crest; Neuroglia; Neurons; Nuclear Proteins; Peripheral Nervous System; Protein Isoforms; Repressor Proteins; rhoB GTP-Binding Protein; Transcription Factors; Up-Regulation; Animalia; Gallus gallus; Gastropoda","GENBANK: AJ626988, AJ626989","DNA-Binding Proteins; High Mobility Group Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Protein Isoforms; Repressor Proteins; rhoB GTP-Binding Protein, EC 3.6.5.2; Sox-10 transcription factor; Transcription Factors",,,,"Akiyama, H., Chaboissier, M.C., Martin, J.F., Schedl, A., de Crombrugghe, B., The transcription factor Sox9 has essential roles in successive steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway and is required for expression of Sox5 and Sox6 (2002) Genes Dev., 16, pp. 2813-2828; Anderson, C.B., Meier, S., The influence of the metameric pattern in the mesoderm on migration of cranial neural crest cells in the chick embryo (1981) Dev.
