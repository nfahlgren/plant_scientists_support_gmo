This responsiveness has proven to be a successful evolutionary trait. Here, we tested the hypothesis that two key environmental factors, light and nutrition, are integrated within the axillary bud to promote or suppress the growth of the bud into a branch. Using petunia (Petunia hybrida) as a model for vegetative branching, we manipulated both light quality (as crowding and the red-to-far-red light ratio) and phosphate availability, such that the axillary bud at node 7 varied from deeply dormant to rapidly growing. In conjunction with the phenotypic characterization, we also monitored the state of the strigolactone (SL) pathway by quantifying SL-related gene transcripts. Mutants in the SL pathway inhibit but do not abolish the branching response to these environmental signals, and neither signal is dominant over the other, suggesting that the regulation of branching in response to the environment is complex. We have isolated three new putatively SL-related TCP (for Teosinte branched1, Cycloidia, and Proliferating cell factor) genes from petunia, and have identified that these TCP-type transcription factors may have roles in the SL signaling pathway both before and after the reception of the SL signal at the bud. We show that the abundance of the receptor transcript is regulated by light quality, such that axillary buds growing in added far-red light have greatly increased receptor transcript abundance. This suggests a mechanism whereby the impact of any SL signal reaching an axillary bud is modulated by the responsiveness of these cells to the signal. © 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The signal transduction pathways for both SLs and karrikins require the same F-box protein (MAX2 and closely related α/β hydrolase fold proteins (DAD2 and KAI2. The crystal structure of DAD2 has been solved revealing an α/β hydrolase fold protein with an internal cavity capable of accommodating SLs. DAD2 responds to the SL analog GR24 by changing conformation and binding to MAX2 in a GR24 concentration-dependent manner. DAD2 can also catalyze hydrolysis of GR24. Structure activity relationships of analogs indicate that the butenolide ring common to both SLs and karrikins is essential for biological activity, but the remainder of the molecules can be significantly modified without loss of activity. The combination of data from the study of DAD2, KAI2, and chemical analogs of SLs and karrikins suggests a model for binding that requires nucleophilic attack by the active site serine of the hydrolase at the carbonyl atom of the butenolide ring. A conformational change occurs in the hydrolase that results in interaction with the F-box protein MAX2. Downstream signal transduction is then likely to occur via SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box complex-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins and their subsequent degradation. The role of the catalytic activity of the hydrolase is unclear but it may be integral in binding as well as possibly allowing the signal to be cleared from the receptor. The α/β hydrolase fold family consists mostly of active enzymes, with a few notable exceptions. We suggest that DAD2 and KAI2 represent an intermediate stage where some catalytic activity is retained at the same time as a receptor role has evolved. © 2012 Janssen and Snowden.","Branching; Hormone; Karrikin; Receptor; Strigolactone",,,,,,,"Aguilar-Martínez, J.A., Poza-Carrión, C., Cubas, P., Arabidopsis BRANCHED1 acts as an integrator of branching signals within axillary buds (2007) Plant Cell, 19, pp. 458-472; Agusti, J., Herold, S., Schwarz, M., Sanchez, P., Ljung, K., Dun, E.A., Strigolactone signaling is required for auxin-dependent stimulation of secondary growth in plants (2011) Proc.

They are carotenoid-derived lactones, synthesized in the roots and transported acropetally to modulate axillary bud outgrowth (i.e., branching) [1, 2]. However, a receptor for strigolactones has not been identified. We have identified the DAD2 gene from petunia, an ortholog of the rice and Arabidopsis D14 genes, and present evidence for its roles in strigolactone perception and signaling. DAD2 acts in the strigolactone pathway, and the dad2 mutant is insensitive to the strigolactone analog GR24. The crystal structure of DAD2 reveals an α/β hydrolase fold containing a canonical catalytic triad with a large internal cavity capable of accommodating strigolactones. In the presence of GR24 DAD2 interacts with PhMAX2A, a central component of strigolactone signaling, in a GR24 concentration-dependent manner. DAD2 can hydrolyze GR24, with mutants of the catalytic triad abolishing both this activity and the ability of DAD2 to interact with PhMAX2A. The hydrolysis products can neither stimulate the protein-protein interaction nor modulate branching. These observations suggest that DAD2 acts to bind the mobile strigolactone signal and then interacts with PhMAX2A during catalysis to initiate an SCF-mediated signal transduction pathway. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Arabidopsis protein; carrier protein; GR24 compound; hydrolase; lactone; MAX2 protein, Arabidopsis; phytohormone; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; chemistry; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; Petunia; plant; plant leaf; plant root; prenatal development; signal transduction; transport at the cellular level; X ray crystallography; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biological Transport; Carrier Proteins; Crystallography, X-Ray; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hydrolases; Lactones; Molecular Sequence Data; Petunia; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Signal Transduction; Arabidopsis; Petunia","GENBANK: JQ654485, JQ654486","carrier protein, 80700-39-6; hydrolase, 9027-41-2; lactone, 1338-03-0; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carrier Proteins; GR24 compound; Hydrolases, 3.-; Lactones; MAX2 protein, Arabidopsis; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Proteins",,,,"Umehara, M., Hanada, A., Yoshida, S., Akiyama, K., Arite, T., Takeda-Kamiya, N., Magome, H., Yoneyama, K., Inhibition of shoot branching by new terpenoid plant hormones (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 195-200; Gomez-Roldan, V., Fermas, S., Brewer, P.B., Puech-Pagès, V., Dun, E.A., Pillot, J.-P., Letisse, F., Portais, J.-C., Strigolactone inhibition of shoot branching (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 189-194; Snowden, K.C., Simkin, A.J., Janssen, B.J., Templeton, K.R., Loucas, H.M., Simons, J.L., Karunairetnam, S., Klee, H.J., The Decreased apical dominance1/Petunia hybrida CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE8 gene affects branch production and plays a role in leaf senescence, root growth, and flower development (2005) Plant Cell, 17, pp. 746-759; Woo, H.R., Chung, K.M., Park, J.-H., Oh, S.A., Ahn, T., Hong, S.H., Jang, S.K., Nam, H.G., ORE9, an F-box protein that regulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (2001) Plant Cell, 13, pp. 1779-1790; Akiyama, K., Matsuzaki, K.-I., Hayashi, H., Plant sesquiterpenes induce hyphal branching in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (2005) Nature, 435, pp. 824-827; Bouwmeester, H.J., Matusova, R., Zhongkui, S., Beale, M.H., Secondary metabolite signalling in host-parasitic plant interactions (2003) Curr.

Understanding plant responses to stress may open up novel opportunities to extend postharvest life. One of the first stresses experienced by harvested organs is likely to be water deficit stress since severance of the vascular system halts the normal flux of water into the tissue. For broccoli branchlets with their cut ends held in water, transcriptome analysis based on hybridization of broccoli floret mRNA to a heterologous Arabidopsis microarray revealed that the transcript abundance of 431 genes reliably changed within 48. h of harvest. Of these, transcripts of 146 genes increased and 34 genes decreased in abundance by 3-fold or more. When broccoli branchlets were held with their cut ends in PEG solution they showed a five-fold reduction in branchlet fresh weight at 48. h compared with controls. Holding branchlets in humid air resulted in an intermediate loss in fresh weight. This PEG-induced high water deficit stress further enhanced the mRNA accumulation of only a small percentage (14%) of the harvest-induced genes. However, for the group of 110 genes that responded to the PEG treatment, the transcript abundance of 90 correlated with the extent of water deficit. Another group (18% of harvest-induced genes) was repressed under more severe water stress, indicating that harvest and water-deficit stress have opposite effects on the transcript abundance of some genes. Gene cluster analysis showed that these genes included a cluster associated with sugar metabolism that may be responding to reduced sugar content. Genes required for photosynthesis and protein translation were also down-regulated by severe water stress, but were unaffected in the water control 48. h after harvest. We conclude that water deficit stress is not the primary driver of harvest-related transcriptome changes in the florets of a detached broccoli head. The findings suggest that the molecular responses to sugar depletion and water deficit stress are not simply additive and appear to be interactive in the harvested tissue. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Cross-species microarray; Immature inflorescence; Osmotic stress; Postharvest senescence; Water stress","Arabidopsis; Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Brassica oleracea var. italica",,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J.H., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402; Buchanan-Wollaston, V., Page, T., Harrison, E., Breeze, E., Lim, P.O., Nam, H.G., Lin, J.F., Leaver, C.J., Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals significant differences in gene expression and signalling pathways between developmental and dark/starvation-induced senescence in Arabidopsis (2005) Plant J., 42, pp. 567-585; Chaves, M.M., Maroco, J.P., Pereira, J.S., Understanding plant responses to drought-From genes to the whole plant (2003) Funct.

Actinidia chinensis is a woody perennial plant grown for commercial production of kiwifruit. CCD7 and CCD8 genes were isolated from A. chinensis and these genes are predominantly expressed in the roots of kiwifruit. AcCCD7 and AcCCD8 were able to complement the corresponding Arabidopsis mutants max3 and max4. The function of AcCCD8 in branch development was determined in transgenic kiwifruit plants containing an RNAi construct for AcCCD8. Reduction in expression of AcCCD8 correlated with an increase in branch development and delayed leaf senescence. The CCD pathway for control of branch development is conserved across a wide range of species, including kiwifruit, a woody perennial. © The Authors (2010).

Bacteria and yeasts are not easily identified using conventional methods such as dilution plating and biochemical tests. Those methods lack sensitivity, are extremely time-consuming and cannot account for unculturable organisms. New DNA-based technology, such as microarrays, offers solutions to those problems. However, identification of microorganisms using DNA methodology is becoming increasingly complicated due to the variation revealed in sequenced microbe genomes. Identification is no longer considered reliable when only one area of the genome is targeted, and recent publications consider that sequences from six or seven different genes are required to resolve species or pathovars of fungi and bacteria reliably. A large number of probes from different genes can be included on a single microarray chip. The advantages and disadvantages of microarrays versus other DNA methods for studying microbial ecology of fruit surfaces are discussed.","Bacteria; DNA; Fructosphere; Fungi; Microbial ecology; Quantitative PCR","Bacteria (microorganisms);

Transcript profiling of closely related species provides a means for identifying genes potentially important in species diversification. However, the predictive value of transcript profiling for inferring downstream-physiological processes has been unclear. In the present study we use shotgun proteomics to validate inferences from microarray studies regarding physiological differences in three Pachycladon species. We compare transcript and protein profiling and evaluate their predictive value for inferring glucosinolate chemotypes characteristic of these species. Results. Evidence from heterologous microarrays and shotgun proteomics revealed differential expression of genes involved in glucosinolate hydrolysis (myrosinase-associated proteins) and biosynthesis (methylthioalkylmalate isomerase and dehydrogenase), the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate (carbonic anhydrases), water use efficiency (ascorbate peroxidase, 2 cys peroxiredoxin, 20 kDa chloroplastic chaperonin, mitochondrial succinyl CoA ligase) and others (glutathione-S-transferase, serine racemase, vegetative storage proteins, genes related to translation and photosynthesis). Differences in glucosinolate hydrolysis products were directly confirmed. Overall, prediction of protein abundances from transcript profiles was stronger than prediction of transcript abundance from protein profiles. Protein profiles also proved to be more accurate predictors of glucosinolate profiles than transcript profiles. The similarity of species profiles for both transcripts and proteins reflected previously inferred phylogenetic relationships while glucosinolate chemotypes did not. Conclusions. We have used transcript and protein profiling to predict physiological processes that evolved differently during diversification of three Pachycladon species. This approach has also identified candidate genes potentially important in adaptation, which are now the focus of ongoing study. Our results indicate that protein profiling provides a valuable tool for validating transcript profiles in studies of adaptive divergence. © 2010 Voelckel et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"abundance;

The diversity of form observed in nature results, in part, from variation in the regulation of branching between species. Two CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE (CCD) genes, CCD7 and CCD8, are required for the production of a branch-suppressing plant hormone. Here, we report that the decreased apical dominance3 (dad3) mutant of petunia (Petunia hybrida) results from the mutation of the PhCCD7 gene and has a less severe branching phenotype than mutation of PhCCD8 (dad1). An analysis of the expression of this gene in wild-type, mutant, and grafted petunia suggests that in petunia, CCD7 and CCD8 are coordinately regulated. In contrast to observations in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ccd7ccd8 double mutants in petunia show an additive phenotype. An analysis using dad3 or dad1 mutant scions grafted to wild-type rootstocks showed that when these plants produce adventitious mutant roots, branching is increased above that seen in plants where the mutant roots are removed. The results presented here indicate that mutation of either CCD7 or CCD8 in petunia results in both the loss of an inhibitor of branching and an increase in a promoter of branching. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"vegetable protein; antibody specificity; article; biomass; chromosome segregation; enzymology; feedback system; gene expression regulation; genetic complementation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; morphogenesis; mutation; nucleotide sequence; organ size; Petunia; phenotype; plant; plant gene; plant root; plant stem; reproducibility; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; signal transduction; Biomass; Chromosome Segregation; Feedback, Physiological; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genetic Complementation Test; Molecular Sequence Data; Morphogenesis; Mutation; Organ Size; Organ Specificity; Petunia; Phenotype; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Plant Stems; Reproducibility of Results; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Petunia; Petunia x hybrida","GENBANK: FJ790878","Plant Proteins",,,,"Akiyama, K., Matsuzaki, K., Hayashi, H., Plant sesquiterpenes induce hyphal branching in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (2005) Nature, 435, pp. 824-827; Arite, T., Iwata, H., Ohshima, K., Maekawa, M., Nakajima, M., Kojima, M., Sakakibara, H., Kyozuka, J., DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice (2007) Plant J, 51, pp. 1019-1029; Auldridge, M.E., Block, A., Vogel, J.T., Dabney-Smith, C., Mila, I., Bouzayen, M., Magallanes-Lundback, M., Klee, H.J., Characterization of three members of the Arabidopsis carotenoid cleavage ioxygenase family demonstrates the divergent roles of this multifunctional enzyme family (2006) Plant J, 45, pp. 982-993; Bainbridge, K., Sorefan, K., Ward, S., Leyser, O., Hormonally controlled expression of the Arabidopsis MAX4 shoot branching regulatory gene (2005) Plant J, 44, pp. 569-580; Booker, J., Auldridge, M., Wills, S., McCarty, D., Klee, H., Leyser, O., MAX3/CCD7 is a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase required for the synthesis of a novel plant signaling molecule (2004) Curr Biol, 14, pp. 1232-1238; Booker, J., Sieberer, T., Wright, W., Williamson, L., Willett, B., Stirnberg, P., Turnbull, C., Leyser, O., MAX1 encodes a cytochrome P450 family member that acts downstream of MAX3/4 to produce a carotenoid-derived branch-inhibiting hormone (2005) Dev Cell, 8, pp. 443-449; Cook, C.E., Whichard, L.P., Turner, B., Wall, M.E., Egley, G.H., Germination of witchweed (Striga lutea Lour.): Isolation and properties of a potent stimulant (1966) Science, 154, pp. 1189-1190; Drummond, R.S.M., Ledger, S.E., Simons, J.L., Janssen, B.J., Snowden, K.C., Vegetative branching in petunia (2009) Petunia: Evolutionary, Developmental and Physiological Genetics, pp. 157-178. , In T Gerats, J Strommer, eds, Springer, New York; Faiss, M., Zalubìlová, J., Strnad, M., Schmulling, T., Conditional transgenic expression of the ipt gene indicates a function for cytokinins in paracrine signaling in whole tobacco plants (1997) Plant J, 12, pp. 401-415; Foo, E., Morris, S.E., Parmenter, K., Young, N., Wang, H., Jones, A., Rameau, C., Beveridge, C.A., Feedback regulation of xylem cytokinin content is conserved in pea and Arabidopsis (2007) Plant Physiol, 143, pp. 1418-1428; Foo, E., Turnbull, C.G.N., Beveridge, C.A., Long-distance signaling and the control of branching in the rms1 mutant of pea (2001) Plant Physiol, 126, pp. 203-209; Gleave, A.P., A versatile binary vector system with a T-DNA organisational structure conducive to efficient integration of cloned DNA into the plant genome (1992) Plant Mol Biol, 20, pp. 1203-1207; Gomez-Roldan, V., Fermas, S., Brewer, P.B., Puech-Pages, V., Dun, E.A., Pillot, J.P., Letisse, F., et al, Strigolactone inhibition of shoot branching (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 189-194; Hanada, K., Tillers (1993) Science of the Rice Plant, 1, pp. 222-229. , In T Matsuo, K Hoshikawa, eds, Morphology.

Kiwifruit vines are often treated with the dormancy-breaking chemical hydrogen cyanamide (HC) to increase and synchronize budbreak. This treatment also offers a tool to understand the processes involved in budbreak. A genomics approach is presented here to increase our understanding of budbreak in kiwifruit. Most genes identified following HC application appear to be associated with responses to stress, but a number of genes appear to be associated with the reactivation of growth. Three patterns of gene expression were identified: Profile 1, an HC-induced transient activation; Profile 2, an HC-induced transient activation followed by a growth-related activation; and Profile 3, HC- and growth-repressed. One group of genes that was rapidly up-regulated in response to HC was the glutathione S-transferase (GST) class of genes, which have been associated with stress and signalling. Previous budbreak studies, in three other species, also report up-regulated GST expression. Phylogenetic analysis of these GSTs showed that they clustered into two sub-clades, suggesting a strong correlation between their expression and budbreak across species.","Actinidia deliciosa; Bud dormancy; Budbreak; Glutathione S-transferase; Hydrogen cyanamide; Kiwifruit; Microarray","cyanamide; vegetable protein; article; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; kiwifruit; metabolism; physiology; transcription initiation; Actinidia; Cyanamide; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Proteins; Transcriptional Activation; Actinidia deliciosa",,"cyanamide, 151-51-9, 420-04-2; Cyanamide, 420-04-2; Plant Proteins",,,,"Arora, R., Rowland, L.J., Tanino, K., Induction and release of bud dormancy in woody perennials: A science comes of age (2003) HortScience, 38 (5); Bohlenius, H., Huang, T., Charbonnel-Campaa, L., Brunner, A.M., Jansson, S., Strauss, S.H., Nilsson, O., CO/FT regulatory module controls timing of flowering and seasonal growth cessation in trees (2006) Science, 312 (5776). , DOI 10.1126/science.1126038; Bound, S.A., Jones, K.M., Hydrogen cyanamide Impacts on flowering, crop load, and fruit quality of red 'Fuji' apple (Malus domestica) (2004) New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science, 32; Brenac, P., Horbowicz, M., Downer, S.M., Dickerman, A.M., Smith, M.E., Obendorf, R.L., Raffinose accumulation related to desiccation tolerance during maize (Zea mays L.)

Albert, Auckland, New Zealand","Plant form is established by the response of the plant to endogenous and environmental cues. One architectural process for which genetic components have been identified is the decision for axillary buds to grow. In Petunia, a number of genes involved in the decision to branch have been identified and aspects of their functions are elucidated. The genes altered in the dad mutants appear to be involved in a single pathway that controls branching and to interact with auxin and cytokinins. These genes mediate the production and reception of hormones inducing and suppressing bud outgrowth. Among species there is a high degree of gene conservation in the pathway and the similarities and differences in gene functions have shown the power of using multiple plant systems. The understanding of developmental processes allows controlled modifications to be made, and the continuing research into axillary bud fate will have a significant impact on future improvements to crop species. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

However, few studies have sought to evaluate the importance of these environments as abiotic drivers in the diversification of plant species. Of particular interest is the Late Tertiary radiation of Pachycladon, an endemic New Zealand genus of alpine cress. Here we report observations on genome-wide levels of differential expression measured in the habitats of two closely related species of Pachycladon with distinct altitudinal preferences. Using Arabidopsis microarrays, we have identified 310 predominantly hormone- and stress-response genes up-regulated in Pachycladon fastigiata and 324 genes up-regulated in Pachycladon enysii. Expression patterns for glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysis genes (MAM1, MAM-I, MAM-D, AOP2, ESP, ESM1) as well as flavonoid biosynthesis genes (F3'H, FLS, FAH1) were found to be species specific. Predicted differences in flavonoid contents were partly confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Differences in glucosinolate profiles and glucosinolate hydrolysis products obtained by high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, respectively, also supported inferences from expression analyses. Five glucosinolate chemotypes were matched to known Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the potential adaptive significance of these chemotypes has been discussed. Our findings, in contrast to expectations for evolution of the New Zealand flora, suggest that biotic drivers, such as plant-herbivore interactions, are likely to be as important as abiotic drivers in the diversification of Pachycladon. © 2008 The Authors.","Adaptive radiation;

Commercial success is driven by the development of new cultivars with novel consumer traits including flavor, appearance, healthful components and convenience. To increase our understanding of the genetic diversity and gene-based control of these key traits in Actinidia, we have produced a collection of 132,577 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Results: The ESTs were derived mainly from four Actinidia species (A. chinensis, A. deliciosa, A. arguta and A. eriantha) and fell into 41,858 non redundant clusters (18,070 tentative consensus sequences and 23,788 EST singletons). Analysis of flavor and fragrance-related gene families (acyltransferases and carboxylesterases) and pathways (terpenoid biosynthesis) is presented in comparison with a chemical analysis of the compounds present in Actinidia including esters, acids, alcohols and terpenes. ESTs are identified for most genes in color pathways controlling chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis. In the health area, data are presented on the ESTs involved in ascorbic acid and quinic acid biosynthesis showing not only that genes for many of the steps in these pathways are represented in the database, but that genes encoding some critical steps are absent. In the convenience area, genes related to different stages of fruit softening are identified. Conclusion: This large EST resource will allow researchers to undertake the tremendous challenge of understanding the molecular basis of genetic diversity in the Actinidia genus as well as provide an EST resource for comparative fruit genomics. The various bioinformatics analyses we have undertaken demonstrates the extent of coverage of ESTs for genes encoding different biochemical pathways in Actinidia. © 2008 Crowhurst et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"acid;

Apple fruit develop over a period of 150 days from anthesis to fully ripe. An array representing approximately 13000 genes (15726 oligonucleotides of 45-55 bases) designed from apple ESTs has been used to study gene expression over eight time points during fruit development. This analysis of gene expression lays the groundwork for a molecular understanding of fruit growth and development in apple. Results. Using ANOVA analysis of the microarray data, 1955 genes showed significant changes in expression over this time course. Expression of genes is coordinated with four major patterns of expression observed: high in floral buds; high during cell division; high when starch levels and cell expansion rates peak; and high during ripening. Functional analysis associated cell cycle genes with early fruit development and three core cell cycle genes are significantly up-regulated in the early stages of fruit development. Starch metabolic genes were associated with changes in starch levels during fruit development. Comparison with microarrays of ethylene-treated apple fruit identified a group of ethylene induced genes also induced in normal fruit ripening. Comparison with fruit development microarrays in tomato has been used to identify 16 genes for which expression patterns are similar in apple and tomato and these genes may play fundamental roles in fruit development. The early phase of cell division and tissue specification that occurs in the first 35 days after pollination has been associated with up-regulation of a cluster of genes that includes core cell cycle genes. Conclusion. Gene expression in apple fruit is coordinated with specific developmental stages.

Leaf strips from in vitro grown kiwifruit plants were transformed using three avirulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (GV3101, EHA105 and LBA4404) and one virulent strain (A281). Each strain harboured the pART27-10 binary vector which encodes an nptII gene for kanamycin resistance and the uidA gene for histochemical GUS staining. Over 70% of calli derived from the three avirulent strains regenerated shoots and all these shoots initiated roots. However, less than 20% of calli from the virulent A281 strain produced normal shoots and roots. The highest efficiency was obtained with strain EHA105. GUS activity was detected in all calli and the transgenic nature of regenerated plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using EHA105 is currently being used for high-throughput functional genomic studies in the genus Actinidia. More than 700 transgenic plants in four Actinidia species have been produced during the last three years.","Actinidia chinensis; Agrobacterium-mediated transformation; Functional genomics; Kiwifruit","Actinidia; Actinidia chinensis; Actinidia deliciosa; Agrobacterium; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Rhizobium",,,,,,"Cao, X., Liu, Q., Rowland, L.J., Hammerschlag, F.A., GUS expression in blueberry (Vaccinium spp.): Factors influencing Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer efficiency (1998) Plant Cell Rep, 18, pp. 266-270; De Bondt, A., Eggermont, K., Druart, P., De Vil, M., Goderis, I., Vanderleyden, J., Borekaert, W.F., Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of apple (Malus x domestica Borkh): An assessment of factors affecting gene transfer efficiency during early transformation steps (1994) Plant Cell Rep, 13, pp. 587-593; Fraser, G.L., Kent, J., Harvey, C., Transformation studies of Actinidia chinensis planch (1995) NZ J.

The effects of insufficient winter chilling can be reduced by an application of the dormancy-breaking chemical hydrogen cyanamide (HC). In addition, HC application also increases the number of flowers per shoot. We are investigating the molecular changes occurring during budbreak and in response to HC application. Three microarray experiments were set up to compare the effects of HC application, bud position on a cane in spring, and shoot tipping in summer. It is expected that a combined analysis of these three datasets will identify genes that are associated with budbreak. Here, the data from the first experiment are described, where the effects of HC on dormancy release were investigated. For this experiment, meristems were dissected from buds one day before HC application, and from HC-treated and non-treated vines one day, three days and six days after application. This short time frame, based on previous experimental knowledge, was before increases in bud proline levels and morphological changes. Each microarray slide contained 17,524 oligos representing approximately 17,000 unigenes from HortResearch's proprietary kiwifruit EST database. This analysis identified 561 ESTs (approximately 3%) with greater than two-fold changes in expression. Of those up-regulated early in the time course, there was a marked increase in genes associated with stress responses. During the qPCR validation process, two transcript accumulation profiles were observed: Profile 1: A single early peak in buds collected from vines treated with HC but no accumulation in buds collected from untreated vines. Profile 2: A biphasic response in buds collected from HC vines (early and latepeaks) and a single late peak in untreated buds, later than that seen in treated vines. The early peak appears to be in direct response to HC application and the late peaks appear to be associated with budbreak and shoot outgrowth.","Actinidia; Dormancy; Gene expression profiles; Microarrays","Actinidia; Actinidia deliciosa",,,,,,"Brundell, D.J., Flower development of the Chinese gooseberry (Actinidia chinensis Planch) I.

In this study, we present a 15,720-feature apple microarray analysis of the variability of gene expression in buds from field-grown apple trees. Tree-to-tree and day-to-day variances were assessed during two different seasons: summer, when the meristems in the buds were undergoing the first stages of floral development, and autumn, when the buds were undergoing transition to winter dormancy. We found that apple trees with the same scion and rootstock cultivars, grown in a standard orchard environment, had small tree-to-tree variation. Gene expression differences caused by season was the dominant cause of variance while using false discovery rate control with a threshold of α*=0.01 to select significantly different expression between genes. At this threshold, the environmental and location effects accounted for less than 10% of the genes selected. Consequently, we have shown that field microarray experiments are a viable approach for measuring seasonal changes in gene expression during apple bud development. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Bud development; Malus x domestica Borkh.; Microarray variability","Malus x domestica",,,,,,"Amasino, R.M., Vernalization and flowering time (2005) Curr Opin Biotechnol, 16, pp. 154-158; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) J R Stat Soc, 57, pp. 289-300; Chang, S., Puryear, J., Cairney, J., A simple and efficient method for isolating RNA from pine trees (1993) Plant Mol Biol Report, 11, pp. 113-116; Chen, W.Q., Provart, N.J., Glazebrook, J., Katagiri, F., Chang, H.S., Eulgem, T., Mauch, F., Budworth, P.R., Expression profile matrix of Arabidopsis transcription factor genes suggests their putative functions in response to environmental stresses (2002) Plant Cell, 14, pp. 559-574; Colantuoni, C., Henry, G., Zeger, S., Pevsner, J., SNOMAD (Standardization and NOrmalization of MicroArray Data): Web-accessible gene expression data analysis (2002) Bioinformatics, 18, pp. 1540-1541; Derory, J., Leger, P., Garcia, V., Schaeffer, J., Hauser, M.T., Salin, F., Luschnig, C., Kremer, A., Transcriptome analysis of bud burst in sessile oak (Quercus petraea) (2006) New Phytol, 170, pp. 723-738; Fonseca, S., Hackler Jr., L., Zvara, A., Ferreira, S., Balde, A., Dudits, D., Pais, M.S., Puskas, L.G., Monitoring gene expression along pear fruit development, ripening and senescence using cDNA microarrays (2004) Plant Sci, 167, pp. 457-469; Foster, T., Johnston, R., Seleznyova, A., A morphological and quantitative characterization of early floral development in apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.)

An understanding of the infection process at the genetic/molecular level within the leafroller complex may lead to strategies to enhance the effectiveness of the virus. Microarray technology was used to examine the effects of viral infection on gene expression levels in E. postvittana gut tissue. The results show that a 5 day infection with EppoNPV caused a significant down-regulation of several E. postvittana genes, many of which were consistent with a response to injury or stress, or with the triggering of apoptosis (such as components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway). The majority of the expressed viral sequences detected are structural genes and genes associated with late gene expression. These data provide a basis from which to compare EppoNPV infection in other less susceptible leafroller species.","Baculovirus; Epiphyas postvittana; EppoNPV; Gene expression; Microarray; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Tortricid; Viral infection","Epiphyas postvittana; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Tortricidae",,,,,,"Belyavskyi, M., Braunagel, S.C., Summers, M.D., The structural protein ODV-EC27 of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus is a multifunctional viral cyclin (1998) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, 95 (19), pp. 11205-11210; Clarke, T.E., Clem, R.J., Insect defenses against virus infection: The role of apoptosis (2003) International Reviews of Immunology, 22, pp. 401-424; Clem, R.J., The role of apoptosis in defense against baculovirus infection in insects (2005) Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 289, pp. 113-130; Dimopoulos, G., Christophides, G.K., Meister, S., Schultz, J., White, K.P., Barillas-Mury, C., Kafatos, F.C., Genome expression of Anopheles gambiae: Responses to injury, bacterial challenge, and malaria infection (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, 99, pp. 8814-8819; Fujii, J., Taniguchi, N., Down regulation of superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidase by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (1999) Free Radical Research, 31, pp. 301-308; Green, D.R., Reed, J.C., Mitochondria and apoptosis (1998) Science, 281 (5381), pp. 1309-1312; Hawtin, R.E., Zarkowska, T., Arnold, K., Thomas, C.J., Gooday, G.W., King, L.A., Kuzio, J.A., Possee, R.D., Liquefaction of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus-infected insects is dependent on the integrity of virus-encoded chitinase and cathepsin genes (1997) Virology, 238, pp. 243-253; Hyink, O., Dellow, R.A., Olsen, M.J., Caradoc-Davies, M.B., Drake, K., Herniou, E.A., Cory, J.S., Ward, V.K., Whole genome analysis of the Epiphyas postvittana nucleopolyhedrovirus (2002) Journal of General Virology, 83, pp. 957-971; Hyink, O., Graves, S., Fairbairn, F.M., Ward, V.K., Mapping and polyhedrin gene analysis of the Epiphyas postvittana nucleopolyhedrovirus genome (1998) Journal of General Virology, 79, pp. 2853-2862; Iorio, C., Vialard, J.E., McCracken, S., Lagace, M., Richardson, C.D., The late expression factors 8 and 9 and possibly phosphoprotein p78/83 of Autographa californica Multicapsid Nucleopolyhedrovirus are components of the virus-induced RNA polymerase (1998) Intervirology, 41 (1), pp. 35-46; Irving, P., Troxler, L., Heuer, T.S., Belvin, M., Kopczynski, C., Reichhart, J.M., Hoffmann, J.A., Hetru, C., A genome-wide analysis of immune responses in Drosophila (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, 98 (26), pp. 15119-15124; Krishnan, N., Kodrik, D., Antioxidant enzymes in Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval): Are they enhanced to protect gut tissues during oxidative stress?

Albert, Auckland, New Zealand","Ethylene is the major effector of ripening in many fleshy fruits. In apples (Malus x domestica) the addition of ethylene causes a climacteric burst of respiration, an increase in aroma, and softening of the flesh. We have generated a transgenic line of 'Royal Gala' apple that produces no detectable levels of ethylene using antisense ACC OXIDASE, resulting in apples with no ethylene-induced ripening attributes. In response to external ethylene these antisense fruits undergo a normal climacteric burst and produced increasing concentrations of ester, polypropanoid, and terpene volatile compounds over an 8-d period. A total of 186 candidate genes that might be involved in the production of these compounds were mined from expressed sequence tags databases and full sequence obtained. Expression patterns of 179 of these were assessed using a 15,720 oligonucleotide apple microarray. Based on sequence similarity and gene expression patterns we identified 17 candidate genes that are likely to be ethylene control points for aroma production in apple. While many of the biosynthetic steps in these pathways were represented by gene families containing two or more genes, expression patterns revealed that only a single member is typically regulated by ethylene. Only certain points within the aroma biosynthesis pathways were regulated by ethylene. Often the first step, and in all pathways the last steps, contained enzymes that were ethylene regulated. This analysis suggests that the initial and final enzymatic steps with the biosynthetic pathways are important transcriptional regulation points for aroma production in apple. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Antisense fruits;

Albert, Auckland, New Zealand","Control of branch development is a major determinant of architecture in plants. Branching in petunia (Petunia hybrida) is controlled by the DECREASED APICAL DOMINANCE (DAD) genes. Gene functions were investigated by plant grafting, morphology studies, double-mutant characterization, and gene expression analysis. Both dad1-1 and dad3 increased branching mutants can be reverted to a near-wild-type phenotype by grafting to a wild-type or a dad2 mutant root stock, indicating that both genes affect the production of a graft-transmissible substance that controls branching. Expression of the DAD1 gene in the stems of grafted plants, detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction correlates with the branching phenotype of the plants. The dad2-1 mutant cannot be reverted by grafting, indicating that this gene acts predominantly in the shoot of the plant. Double-mutant analysis indicates that the DAD2 gene acts in the same pathway as the DAD1 and DAD3 genes because the dad1-1dad2-1 and dad2-1dad3 double mutants are indistinguishable from the dad2-1 mutant. However, the dad1-1dad3 double mutant has an additive phenotype, with decreased height of the plants, delayed flowering, and reduced germination rates compared to the single mutants. This result, together with the observation that the dad1-1 and dad3 mutants cannot be reverted by grafting to each other, suggests that the DAD1 and DAD3 genes act in the same pathway, but not in a simple stepwise fashion. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Gene expression;

Albert Research Centre, Auckland, New Zealand","The domestic apple (Malus domestica; also known as Malus pumila Mill.) has become a model fruit crop in which to study commercial traits such as disease and pest resistance, grafting, and flavor and health compound biosynthesis. To speed the discovery of genes involved in these traits, develop markers to map genes, and breed new cultivars, we have produced a substantial expressed sequence tag collection from various tissues of apple, focusing on fruit tissues of the cultivar Royal Gala. Over 150,000 expressed sequence tags have been collected from 43 different cDNA libraries representing 34 different tissues and treatments. Clustering of these sequences results in a set of 42,938 nonredundant sequences comprising 17,460 tentative contigs and 25,478 singletons, together representing what we predict are approximately one-half the expressed genes from apple. Many potential molecular markers are abundant in the apple transcripts. Dinucleotide repeats are found in 4,018 nonredundant sequences, mainly in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene, with a bias toward one repeat type (containing AG, 88%) and against another (repeats containing CG, 0.1%). Trinucleotide repeats are most common in the predicted coding regions and do not show a similar degree of sequence bias in their representation. Bi-allelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms are highly abundant with one found, on average, every 706 bp of transcribed DNA. Predictions of the numbers of representatives from protein families indicate the presence of many genes involved in disease resistance and the biosynthesis of flavor and health-associated compounds. Comparisons of some of these gene families with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suggest instances where there have been duplications in the lineages leading to apple of biosynthetic and regulatory genes that are expressed in fruit. This resource paves the way for a concerted functional genomics effort in this important temperate fruit crop. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Biosynthesis; Diseases; DNA; Genes; Tissue; Apple (Malus domestica); Regulatory genes; Sequence tags; Fruits; vegetable protein; apple; Arabidopsis; article; cluster analysis; comparative study; DNA sequence; expressed sequence tag; gene library; genetics; genomics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; multigene family; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; trinucleotide repeat; variable number of tandem repeat; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Cluster Analysis; Evolution, Molecular; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gene Library; Genomics; Malus; Minisatellite Repeats; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Signal Transduction; Trinucleotide Repeats; Biosynthesis; Fruits; Genes; Nucleic Acids; Tissue; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Malus pumila; Malus x domestica",,"Plant Proteins",,,,"Adams, M.D., Soares, M.B., Kerlavage, A.R., Fields, C., Venter, J.C., Rapid cDNA sequencing (expressed sequence tags) from a directionally cloned human infant brain cDNA library (1993) Nat Genet, 4, pp. 373-380; Adams-Phillips, L., Barry, C., Giovannoni, J., Signal transduction systems regulating fruit ripening (2004) Trends Pharmacol Sci, 9, pp. 331-338; Aharoni, A., Keizer, L.C.P., Bouwmeester, H.J., Sun, Z., Alvarez-Huerta, M., Verhoeven, H.A., Blaas, J., Van Der Voet, H., Identification of the SAAT gene involved in strawberry flavor biogenesis by use of DNA microarrays (2000) Plant Cell, 12, pp. 647-662; Aharoni, A., O'Connell, A.P., Gene expression analysis of strawberry achene and receptacle maturation using DNA microarrays (2002) J Exp Bot, 53, pp. 2073-2087; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J Mol Biol, 215, pp. 403-410; Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 796-820; Arumuganathan, K., Earle, E.D., Nuclear DNA content of some important plant species (1991) Plant Mol Biol Rep, 9, pp. 208-218; Bengtsson, M., Backman, A.-C., Liblikas, I., Ramirez, M.I., Borg-Karlson, A.-K., Ansebo, L., Andreson, P., Witzgall, P., Plant odor analysis of apple: Antennal response of codling moth females to apple volatiles during phonological development (2001) J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 3736-3741; Ben-Yehudah, G., Korchinsky, R., Redel, G., Ovadya, R., Oren-Shamir, M., Cohen, Y., Colour accumulation patterns and the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in 'Red Delicious' apple variants (2005) J Hortic Sci Biotechnol, 80, pp. 187-192; Bieleski, R.L., Sugar alcohols (1982) Plant Carbohydrates I.

The Decreased apical dominance1 (Dad1)/PhCCD8 gene of petunia (Petunia hybrida) encodes a hypothetical carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) and ortholog of the MORE AXILLARY GROWTH4 (MAX4)/AtCCD8 gene. The dad1-1 mutant allele was inactivated by insertion of an unusual transposon (Dad-one transposon), and the dad1-3 allele is a revertant allele of dad1-1. Consistent with its role in producing a graft-transmissible compound that can alter branching, the Dad1/PhCCD8 gene is expressed in root and shoot tissue. This expression is upregulated in the stems of the dad1-1, dad2, and dad3 increased branching mutants, indicating feedback regulation of the gene in this tissue. However, this feedback regulation does not affect the root expression of Dad1/PhCCD8. Overexpression of Dad1/PhCCD8 in the dad1-1 mutant complemented the mutant phenotype, and RNA interference in the wild type resulted in an increased branching phenotype. Other differences in phenotype associated with the loss of Dad1/PhCCD8 function included altered timing of axillary meristem development, delayed leaf senescence, smaller flowers, reduced internode length, and reduced root growth. These data indicate that the substrate(s) and/or product(s) of the Dad1/PhCCD8 enzyme are mobile signal molecules with diverse roles in plant development. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"carotenoid; dioxygenase; plant DNA; allele; amino acid sequence; article; enzymology; flower; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; Petunia; phenotype; phylogeny; plant leaf; plant root; sequence homology; transgenic plant; transposon; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Carotenoids; Dioxygenases; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Plant; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Petunia; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Cells; Mutagenesis; Plants (botany); RNA; Tissue; Branch production; Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase8; Flower development; Root growth; Genes; Cells; Genes; Mutation; Nucleic Acids; Plant Tissues; Plants; Petunia; Petunia x hybrida","GENBANK: AB073227, AF039855, AF098992, AF294900, AF322256, AJ290393, AJ489277, AL110485, AL663000, AP003296, AP003376, AP003595, AP005369, AY121617, AY557341, CAD33262, D90914, S65040, S80637, U95953, AY743219, AY745251, AY746977","dioxygenase, 37292-90-3; Carotenoids, 36-88-4; Dioxygenases, EC 1.13.11.-; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Plant",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

We conducted phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of all known KNOX proteins in order to examine their evolution. Our analyses reveal two groups of KNOX proteins, classes I and II. Dicot and monocot sequences occur in both classes, indicating that the protein classes arose prior to the origin of the monocots. A conifer (Picea) sequence is nested within class I, suggesting that there are likely to be other copies of KNOX genes in this and other conifers. The orthology of several grass genes (including Zea Kn1, ZMKN1) is strongly supported by phylogenetic and synteny analyses. However, no compelling evidence supports the hypothesis of orthology previously proposed for several dicot genes and ZMKN1. Analysis of expression patterns suggests that the ancestral KNOX gene was expressed in all plant parts and that the propensity to be downregulated in roots and leaves evolved in the class I genes.","Development; Evolution; Homeobox; Phylogeny; Plants","amino acid; homeodomain protein; nucleotide; amino acid sequence; article; grass; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; plant; Amino Acid Sequence; Angiosperms; Base Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Homeobox; Genes, Plant; Homeodomain Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Poaceae; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Coniferophyta; Embryophyta; Liliopsida; Magnoliophyta; Picea; Viridiplantae; Zea","GENBANK: AF000141, AF000142, D16507, D49704, L13663, L19295, L27453, L44133, M31170, U14174, U14175, U32247, U32344, U39944, X57672, X61308, X80127, X80338, X83518, X92392, X92393, X92394, Z29073, Z68114, Z77670","Homeodomain Proteins; Plant Proteins",,,,"Ahn, S., Tanksley, S.D., Comparative linkage maps of the rice and maize genomes (1993) Proc.

In the developing leaf primordium, major leaflet initiation is basipetal, and lobe formation and early vascular differentiation are acropetal. We show that engineered alterations in the expression of a tomato homeobox gene, LeT6, can cause dramatic changes in leaf morphology. The morphological states are variable and unstable and the phenotypes produced indicate that the tomato leaf has an inherent level of indeterminacy. This is manifested by the production of multiple orders of compounding in the leaf, by numerous shoot, inflorescence, and floral meristems on leaves, and by the conversion of rachis-petiolule junctions into ""axillary"" positions where floral buds can arise. Overexpression of a heterologous homeobox transgene, kn1, does not produce such phenotypic variability. This indicates that LeT6 may differ from the heterologous kn1 gene in the effects manifested on overexpression, and that 35S-LeT6 plants may be subject to alterations in expression of both the introduced and endogenous LeT6 genes. The expression patterns of LeT6 argue in favor of a fundamental role for LeT6 in morphogenesis of leaves in tomato and also suggest that variability in homeobox gene expression may account for some of the diversity in leaf form seen in nature.",,,,,,,,"An, G., Ebert, P.R., Mitra, A., Ha, S.B., Binary vectors (1988) Plant Molecular Biology Manual, pp. 1-19. , SB Gelvin, RA Schilperoort, eds, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands; Benfey, P.N., Ren, L., Chua, N.-H., The CaMV 35S enhancer contains at least two domains which can confer different developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns (1989) EMBO J, 8, pp. 2195-2202; Bowman, J.L., Smyth, D.R., Meyerowitz, E.M., Genetic interactions among floral homeotic genes of Arabidopsis (1991) Development, 112, pp. 1-20; Carrol, S.B., Vavra, S.H., The zygotic control of Drosophila pair-rule gene expression: Spacial repression by gap and pair rule gene products (1989) Development, 107, pp. 673-683; Chandra Shekhar, K.N., Sawhney, V.K., Leaf development in the normal and solanifolia mutant of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) (1990) Am J Bot, 77, pp. 46-53; Dellaporta, S.J., Wood, J., Hicks, J.B., A plant DNA minipreparation, version II (1983) Plant Mol Biol Rep, 1, pp. 19-21; Dengler, N.G., Comparison of leaf development in normal (+/+), entire (e/e), and Lanceolate (La/+) plants of tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum ""Ailsa Craig.""

The knotted-like homeobox (knox) genes fall into two classes. The class I knox genes like knl, stml, and knatl are involved in maintaining meristem identity in cells. The function of class II knox genes is at yet undetermined. We have characterized two knox genes from tomato. LeT6 and LET12 map to distinct chromosome locations that are different from the location for a recently cloned knox gene from tomato, tknl, confirming that plant homeobox genes are not clustered on chromosomes. These genes have a distinct expression pattern. Unlike other class I knl-like genes, LeT6 is expressed in developing lateral organs and developing ovaries in flowers. LET12 is more ubiquitously expressed in the mature plant. RNA in situ localization data suggest that both these genes may have a role to play in formative events in ovule and embryo morphogenesis.",,"homeodomain protein; LET12 protein, Lycopersicon esculentum;

All plant cells contain an integrated chromosomal T-DNA copy of the TYDV elements that provides a template for the production of episomes in the cell nucleus. Transgenic Petunia hybrida plants containing a CaMV 35S promoter-driven chalcone synthase A (ChsA) gene cloned into the episomal vector produced flowers with a white-spotted phenotype at high frequency. The spots were found at random locations in the petals and occurred in corresponding positions in both the upper and lower epidermis, indicating that the spots were non-clonal. The spotted phenotype was somatically stable and was inherited through meiosis. In white-spotted flower tissue, steady-state ChsA mRNA levels were down-regulated but rates of RNA transcription were unaffected, suggesting that the phenotype resulted from post-transcriptional gene silencing of the endogenous and episomal ChsA genes. Increases in both the frequency and extent of gene silencing in flowers correlated with increases in episome copy number in mature flowers, flower buds and young and fully expanded leaves. Relatively small increases in episome copy number (less than threefold) appeared sufficient to trigger the gene-silenced phenotype.",,"cell nucleus; chalcone synthase; cloning; DNA replicon; geminivirus; meiosis; messenger RNA; phenotype; plant genetics; tobacco yellow dwarf virus; transgenic plant; Petunia hybrida",,,,,,"Angell, S.M., Baulcombe, D.C., Consistent gene silencing in transgenic plants expressing a replicating potato virus X RNA (1997) EMBO J., 16, pp. 3675-3684; Atkinson, R.G., Eagles, R.M., Forster, R.L.S., Gardner, R.C., Genetic transformation of Cyphomandra betacea (Tamarillo) (1994) Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry, Vol. 29, Plant Protoplasts and Genetic Engineering V, 29, pp. 271-284. , Bajaj, Y.P.S., ed..

These proteins previously have been classified into numerous subgroups whose phylogenetic relationships are unclear. Our phylogenetic analysis of representative eukaryotic sequences suggests that there are two major groups of homeodomain proteins, each containing sequences from angiosperms, metazoa, and fungi. This result, based on parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses of primary amino acid sequences, was supported by two additional features of the proteins. The two protein groups are distinguished by an insertion/deletion in the homeodomain, between helices I and II. In addition, an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the region N terminal of the homeodomain is shared by angiosperm and metazoan sequences in one group. These results support the hypothesis that there was at least one duplication of homeobox genes before the origin of angiosperms, fungi, and metazoa. This duplication, in turn, suggests that these proteins had diverse functions early in the evolution of eukaryotes. The shared secondary structure in angiosperm and metazoan sequences points to an ancient conserved functional domain.",,"homeodomain protein; transcription factor; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; article; eukaryote; evolution; fungus; homeobox; metazoon; phylogeny; priority journal; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; protein synthesis; Amino Acid Sequence; Angiosperms; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Fungi; Genes, Homeobox; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Protein Structure, Secondary; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Eukaryota; Fungi; Magnoliophyta; Metazoa",,"Homeodomain Proteins",,,,"McGinnis, W., Levine, M.S., Hafen, E., Kuroiwa, A., Gehring, W.J., (1984) Nature (London), 308, pp. 428-433; Scott, M.P., Weiner, A.J., (1984) Proc.

Four cDNA clones differentially hybridized to cDNAs from fruit picked 1 WAA versus cDNAs from fruit harvested 8 WAA and flower buds. Them RNAs corresponding to these cDNA clones-pAFD101 through 104-accumulated in the early stages of apple development, with highest levels at 2 to 4 WAA. The mRNA of pAFD104 was detected only in fruit tissue, while mRNAs for the other three clones were expressed at various levels in a range of tissues. Sequence analysis showed that pAFD101 had high homology to genes encoding the translation elongation factor 1α(EF-1α); pAFD102 had homology to the β-subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2β); pAFD104 showed strong similarity to a proline-rich protein and to auxin down-regulated genes; while pAFD103 had no significant homology to any sequences hi the databases. Genomic Southern hybridization showed that genes corresponding to all four cDNAs were representatives of small gene families present in the apple genome.","Differential screening; Elongation factor; Gene expression; Proline-rich protein; Translation initiation factor","Malus x domestica; Malus xdomestica",,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

The knotted1-like homeobox (knox) genes are known to regulate plant development. When overexpressed in homologous or heterologous species, this family of genes can cause changes in leaf morphology, including excessive leaf compounding in tomato. We describe here an instance of a spontaneously arisen fusion between a gene encoding a metabolic enzyme and a homeodomain protein. We show that the fusion results in overexpression of the homeodomain protein and a change in morphology that approximates the changes caused by overexpression of the same gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in transgenic plants. Exon-shuffling events can account for the modularity of proteins. If the shuffled exons are associated with altered promoters, changes in gene expression patterns can result. Our results show that gene fusions of this nature can cause changes in expression patterns that lead to altered morphology. We suggest that such phenomena may have played a role in the evolution of form.",,"gene fusion; genetics; homeobox; plant development; promoter region; tomato; transgenic plant; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; Evolution; Exons; Gene Expression; Genes, Homeobox; Genes, Plant; In Situ Hybridization; Lycopersicon esculentum; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Mutation; Phenotype; Phosphofructokinase-1; Plants, Genetically Modified; Polymerase Chain Reaction","GENBANK: Z32850","DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; Phosphofructokinase-1, EC 2.7.1.11",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic logical alignment search tool (1990) J.

This gene has proved extremely useful for monitoring transformation during the period immediately following gene transfer from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. GUS expression was detectable 2 days after inoculation, peaked at 3-4 days and then declined; if selection was imposed expression increased again after 10-14 days. The extent of transient expression after 4 days correlated well with stable integration as measured by kanamycin resistance, hormone independence, and gall formation. Histochemical staining of inoculated leaf discs confirmed the transient peak of GUS expression 3-4 days after inoculation. The most surprising result was that the blue staining was concentrated in localized zones on the circumference of the disc; within these zones, essentially all the cells appeared to be expressing GUS. We suggest that the frequency of gene transfer from Agrobacterium is extremely high within localized regions of leaf explants, but that the frequency of stable integration is several orders of magnitude lower. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Agrobacterium tumefaciens; cocultivation; GUS; transient expression","beta glucuronidase; Agrobacterium; article; enzymology; Escherichia coli; gene expression; genetic transfection; genetics; metabolism; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; plant; plasmid; restriction mapping; time; Agrobacterium; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Glucuronidase; Molecular Sequence Data; Plants; Plasmids; Restriction Mapping; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors; Transfection",,"beta glucuronidase, 9001-45-0; Glucuronidase, EC 3.2.1.31; Plasmids",,,,"Ausubel, F.M., Bahnsen, K., Hanson, M., Mitchell, A., Smith, H.J., Cell and tissue culture of haploid and diploid Petunia ‘Mitchell’ (1980) Plant Mol Biol Newsl, 1, pp. 26-32; Chriqui, D., David, C., Adam, S., Effect of differentiated or dedifferentiated state of tobacco pith tissue on its behaviour after inoculation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes (1988) Plant Cell Rep, 7, pp. 111-114; Comai, L., Facciotti, D., Hiatt, W.R., Thompson, G., Rose, R.E., Stalker, D.M., Expression in plants of a mutant aro A gene from Salmonella tryphimurium confers tolerance to glyphosate (1985) Nature, 317, pp. 741-744; Crowhurst RN: Isolation, characterization, host specificity, and biological control of the genus Agrobacterium.
