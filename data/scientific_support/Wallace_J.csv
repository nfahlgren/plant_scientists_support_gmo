P. Beauv.] is one among the most ancient crops of dryland agriculture. It is the second most important crop among millets grown for grains or forage. Foxtail millet germplasm resources provide reservoirs of novel alleles and genes for crop improvement that have remained mostly un- explored. We genotyped a set of 190 foxtail millet germplasm accessions (including 155 accessions of the foxtail millet core collection) using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) for rapid single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) characterization to study popula- tion genetics and structure, which enable allele mining through association mapping approaches. After filtering a total 350,000 raw SNPs identified across 190 germplasm accessions for minor allele frequency (MAF), coverage for samples and coverage for sites, we retained 181 accessions with 17,714 high-quality SNPs with 5% MAF. Genetic structure analyses revealed that foxtail millet germplasm accessions are structured along both on the basis of races and geographic origin, and the maximum propor- tion of variation was due to among individuals within popula- tions. Accessions of race indica were less diverse and are highly differentiated from those of maxima and moharia. Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed on an average LD ex- tends up to ~150 kbp and varied with individual chromosomes. The utility of the data for performing genome-wide association studies (GWASs) was tested with plant pigmentation and days to flowering and identified significant marker-trait associations. This SNP data provides a foundation for exploration of foxtail millet diversity and for mining novel alleles and mapping genes for economically important traits. © Crop Science Society of America.",,,,,,,,"Abe, M., Kobayashi, Y., Yamamoto, S., Daimon, Y., Yamaguchi, A., Ikeda, Y., Ichinoki, H., Araki, T., FD, a bZIP protein mediating signals from the floral pathway integrator FT at the shoot apex (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1052-1056; Alexander, D.H., Novembre, J., Lange, K., Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals (2009) Genome Res, 19, pp. 1655-1664; Anju, T., Sarita, S., Suitability of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and barnyard millet (Echinochloa frumentacea) for development of low glycemic index biscuits (2010) Malays.

It is valued for its drought tolerance, rapid maturation, and superior nutritional qualities. Despite these characteristics there are almost no genetic or genomic resources for this crop in either cultivated species [E. colona (L.) Link and E. crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.]. Recently, a core collection of 89 barnyard millet accessions was developed at the genebank at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). To enhance the use of this germplasm and genomic research in barnyard millet improvement, we report the genetic characterization of this core collection using whole-genome genotyping-by-sequencing. We identified several thousand single-nucleotide polymorphisms segregating in the core collection, and we use them to show patterns of population structure and phylogenetic relationships among the accessions. We determine that there are probably four population clusters within the E. colona accessions and three such clusters within E. crus-galli. These clusters match phylogenetic relationships but by and large do not correspond to classification into individual races or clusters based on morphology. Geospatial data available for a subset of samples indicates that the clusters probably originate from geographic divisions. In all, these data will be useful to breeders working to improve this crop for smallholder farmers. This work also serves as a case study of how modern genomics can rapidly characterize crops, including ones with little to no prior genetic data. © Crop Science Society of America.",,"Echinochloa; Echinochloa colona; Echinochloa crus-galli; Echinochloa frumentacea",,,,,"DBI-0820619, NSF, National Science Foundation; IOS-1238014, NSF, National Science Foundation","Anju, T., Sarita, S., Suitability of foxtail millet (2010) J.

All samples were grown in the same field and used to identify natural variation controlling the levels of 12 key C and N metabolites, namely chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, fructose, fumarate, glucose, glutamate, malate, nitrate, starch, sucrose, total amino acids, and total protein, alongwith the first two principal components derived from them. Our genome-wide association results frequently identified hits with single-gene resolution. In addition to expected genes such as invertases, natural variation was identified in key C4 metabolism genes, including carbonic anhydrases and a malate transporter. Unlike several prior maize studies, extensive pleiotropy was found for C and N metabolites. This integration of field-derived metabolite data with powerful mapping and genomics resources allows for the dissection of key metabolic pathways, providing avenues for future genetic improvement. © 2015American Society of Plant Biologists.

In addition to its role in global agriculture, it has also long served as a model organism for genetic research. Maize stands at a genetic crossroads, as it has access to all the tools available for plant genetics but exhibits a genetic architecture more similar to other outcrossing organisms than to self-pollinating crops and model plants. In this review, we summarize recent advances in maize genetics, including the development of powerful populations for genetic mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and the insights these studies yield on the mechanisms underlying complex maize traits. Most maize traits are controlled by a large number of genes, and linkage analysis of several traits implicates a 'common gene, rare allele' model of genetic variation where some genes have many individually rare alleles contributing. Most natural alleles exhibit small effect sizes with little-to-no detectable pleiotropy or epistasis. Additionally, many of these genes are locked away in low-recombination regions that encourage the formation of multi-gene blocks that may underlie maize's strong heterotic effect. Domestication left strong marks on the maize genome, and some of the differences in trait architectures may be due to different selective pressures over time. Overall, maize's advantages as a model system make it highly desirable for studying the genetics of outcrossing species, and results from it can provide insight into other such species, including humans. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Genome-wide association; Heterosis; Maize; Nested association mapping; Quantitative traits","agriculture; allele; domestication; epistasis; gene; genetic variation; genetics; heterosis; maize; outcrossing; pleiotropy; research; Zea mays; chromosome map; genetic association; genetic linkage; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; heterosis; maize; plant genome; quantitative trait locus; review; Chromosome Mapping; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hybrid Vigor; Quantitative Trait Loci; Selection, Genetic; Zea mays",,,,,"0820619, NSF, National Science Foundation","Albrecht, T., Wimmer, V., Auinger, H.-J., Erbe, M., Knaak, C., Ouzunova, M., Genomebased prediction of testcross values in maize (2011) Theor Appl Genet, 123, pp. 339-350; Arteaga-Vazquez, M.A., Chandler, V.L., Paramutation in maize: RNA mediated trans-generational gene silencing (2010) Curr Opin Genet Dev, 20, pp. 156-163; Beadle, G., The ancestry of corn (1980) Scientific American, 242, pp. 112-119; Belo, A., Zheng, P., Luck, S., Shen, B., Meyer, D.J., Li, B., Whole genome scan detects an allelic variant of fad2 associated with increased oleic acid levels in maize (2008) Mol Genet Genomics, 279, pp. 1-10; Bernardo, R., Genomewide selection for rapid introgression of exotic germplasm in maize (2009) Crop Sci, 49, pp. 419-425; Bernardo, R., Yu, J., Prospects for genomewide selection for quantitative traits in maize (2007) Crop Sci, 47, pp. 1082-1090; Brown, P.J., Upadyayula, N., Mahone, G.S., Tian, F., Bradbury, P.J., Myles, S., Distinct genetic architectures for male and female inflorescence traits of maize (2011) PLoS Genet, 7, pp. e1002383; Buckler, E.S., Holland, J.B., Bradbury, P.J., Acharya, C.B., Brown, P.J., Browne, C., The genetic architecture of maize flowering time (2009) Science, 325, pp. 714-718; Buckner, B., Kelson, T.L., Robertson, D.S., Cloning of the yl locus of maize, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids (1990) Plant Cell, 2, pp. 897-876; Camus-Kulandaivelu, L., Veyrieras, J.-B., Madur, D., Combes, V., Fourmann, M., Barraud, S., Maize adaptation to temperate climate: Relationship between population structure and polymorphism in the Dwarf8 gene (2006) Genetics, 172, pp. 2449-2463; Chia, J.-M., Song, C., Bradbury, P.J., Costich, D., De Leon, N., Doebley, J., Maize HapMap2 identifies extant variation from a genome in flux (2012) Nat Genet, 44, pp. 803-807; Coe, E.H., The origins of maize genetics (2001) Nat Rev Genet, 2, pp. 898-905; Cook, J.P., McMullen, M.D., Holland, J.B., Tian, F., Bradbury, P., Ross-Ibarra, J., Genetic architecture of maize kernel composition in the nested association mapping and inbred association panels (2012) Plant Physiol, 158, pp. 824-834; Darwin, C., (1876) The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom, p. 482. , John Murray: London, UK; Duvick, D.N., Biotechnology in the 1930s: The development of hybrid maize (2001) Nat Rev Genet, 2, pp. 69-74; Duvick, D.N., The contribution of breeding to yield advances in maize (Zea mays L.)

Despite the vast amount of genomic data becoming available, many pressing questions remain about the nature of genetic mutations that underlie functional variation. We present the results of combining genome-wide association analysis of 41 different phenotypes in ∼5,000 inbred maize lines to analyze patterns of high-resolution genetic association among of 28.9 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ∼800,000 copy-number variants (CNVs). We show that genic and intergenic regions have opposite patterns of enrichment, minor allele frequencies, and effect sizes, implying tradeoffs among the probability that a given polymorphism will have an effect, the detectable size of that effect, and its frequency in the population. We also find that genes tagged by GWAS are enriched for regulatory functions and are ∼50% more likely to have a paralog than expected by chance, indicating that gene regulation and gene duplication are strong drivers of phenotypic variation. These results will likely apply to many other organisms, especially ones with large and complex genomes like maize. © 2014.",,"Article; controlled study; copy number variation; effect size; gene duplication;

OLE RNAs exhibit several unusual characteristics that indicate a potentially novel function, including exceptionally high expression and localization to cell membranes via interaction with a protein partner called OLE-associated protein (OAP). In the current study, new genetic and phenotypic characteristics of OLE RNA from Bacillus halodurans C-125 were established. OLE RNA is transcribed at high levels from its own promoter under normal growth conditions and the transcript is exceptionally stable compared to most other RNAs. Expression is increased by ∼7-fold when cells are exposed to near lethal concentrations of short-chain alcohols such as ethanol or methanol. Strains wherein the genes for OLE and/or OAP are deleted are more susceptible to growth inhibition by alcohol and also become more sensitive to cold. Normal growth characteristics can be restored by expressing the genes for OLE and OAP from plasmids or from elsewhere on the chromosome. Our findings confirm a functional link between OLE and OAP and reveal the importance of a large non-coding RNA in the response to alcohol-induced stress. © The Author(s) 2012.",,"2 propanol; alcohol; bacterial protein; bacterial RNA; methanol; Ornate Large Extremophilic association protein; Ornate Large Extremophilic RNA; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; article; Bacillus; Bacillus halodurans; bacterial strain; chromosome; enzyme activity; growth inhibition; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; plasmid; priority journal; protein expression; protein RNA binding; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; RNA transcription; Bacillus; Bacterial Proteins; Ethanol; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Untranslated; Sequence Deletion","GENBANK: GSE33303","2 propanol, 67-63-0; alcohol, 64-17-5; methanol, 67-56-1; Bacterial Proteins; Ethanol, 64-17-5; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Untranslated",,,,"Ellis, J.C., Brown, J.W., The RNase P family (2009) RNA Biol., 6, pp. 362-369; Edgell, D.R., Chalamcharla, V.R., Belfort, M., Learning to live together: Mutualism between self-splicing introns and their hosts (2011) BMC Biol., 9, p. 22; De La Peñ, A.M., Garcia-Robles, I., Ubiquitous presence of the hammerhead ribozyme motif along the tree of life (2010) RNA, 16, pp. 1943-1950; Perreault, J., Weinberg, Z., Roth, A., Popescu, O., Chartrand, P., Ferbeyre, G., Breaker, R.R., Identification of hammerhead ribozymes in all domains of life reveals novel structural variations (2011) PLoS Comput.

Despite its many years as a model for alkaliphily and source of industrially important enzymes, genetic manipulation of B. halodurans C-125 remains difficult, and therefore, we sought to develop a robust method to allow routine transformation of this organism. Methods and Results: A plasmid artificial modification system (PAM system, Yasui 2008) for B. halodurans C-125 was created that increases transformation efficiency by 10- to 1000-fold. Also, recovering transformed protoplasts on succinate nutrient agar (SNA) yields faster, more robust colony recovery than on the traditional recovery medium. Combining these two techniques often allows recovery of transformants in as little as 48h. Conclusions: Use of the B. halodurans C-125 PAM system and SNA greatly improves the efficiency and speed of protoplast transformation of B. halodurans C-125. Significance and Impact of the Study: These techniques allow routine genetic manipulation of B. halodurans C-125, a model alkaliphilic bacterium with important industrial properties. © 2011 The Authors.

A gene for an OLE-associated protein (OAP) is almost always located immediately downstream of the OLE gene. OAP has no extensive homology to other proteins and is predicted to form multiple transmembrane domains. We show that this protein forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with OLE RNA using at least 2:1 protein RNA stoichiometry. A series of truncated OLE RNA constructs was used to establish that most of the RNA can be deleted without eliminating protein binding. Two primary binding sites are present within the RNA, although additional binding determinants exist and extensive structural stabilization is induced by OAP. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used in Escherichia coli to demonstrate that ribonucleoprotein complex formation localizes the RNA near cell membranes of this heterologous system. Therefore, the majority of the complex structure formed by OLE RNA may perform a biochemical function that requires membrane localization. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"bacterial RNA; article; bacterial membrane; binding affinity; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; Escherichia coli; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene locus; genetic association; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; priority journal; promoter region; protein domain; protein function; protein localization; protein motif; protein purification; protein RNA binding; protein secondary structure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; RNA structure; sequence homology; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Cell Membrane; Cloning, Molecular; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Models, Molecular; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Protein Binding; Ribonucleoproteins; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Untranslated; Sequence Deletion; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Posibacteria","GENBANK: BA000004, BAB06499","Bacterial Proteins; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Untranslated; Ribonucleoproteins",,,,"Baliarda, A., Robert, H., Jebbar, M., Blanco, C., Le Marrec, C., Isolation and characterization of ButA, a secondary glycine betaine transport system operating in Tetragenococcus halophila (2003) Curr Microbiol, 47, pp. 347-351; Bartel, D.P., Chen, C.Z., Micromanagers of gene expression: the potentially widespread influence of metazoan microRNAs (2004) Nat Rev Genet, 5, pp. 396-400; Block, K.F., Hammond, M.C., Breaker, R.R., Evidence for widespread gene control function by the ydaO riboswitch candidate (2010) J Bacteriol, 192, pp. 3983-3989; Brandt, W., Brauer, L., Gunnewich, N., Kufka, J., Rausch, F., Schulze, D., Molecular and structural basis of metabolic diversity mediated by prenyldiphosphate converting enzymes (2009) Phytochemistry, 70, pp. 1758-1775; Corbino, K.A., Barrick, J.E., Lim, J., Welz, R., Tucker, B.J., Puskarz, I., Evidence for a second class of S-adenosylmethionine riboswitches and other regulatory RNA motifs in alpha-proteobacteria (2005) Genome Biol, 6, pp. R70; Francin, M., Mirande, M., Functional dissection of the eukaryotic-specific tRNA-interacting factor of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (2003) J Biol Chem, 278, pp. 1472-1479; Galperin, M.Y., Koonin, E.V., Who's your neighbor?
