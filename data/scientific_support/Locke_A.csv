Diurnal cycles of photosynthesis and water use in field-grown soybean (Glycine max) are tied to light intensity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). At high mid-day VPD, transpiration rates can lead to a decline in leaf water potential (Ψ<inf>leaf</inf>) if leaf hydraulic conductance (K<inf>leaf</inf>) is insufficient to supply water to intercellular airspaces in pace with demand. K<inf>leaf</inf> is determined by leaf xylem conductivity to water, as well as extra-xylem pathways that are likely mediated by aquaporin water transport proteins. When transpiration demand exceeds the maximum capacity of K<inf>leaf</inf> to supply water, high tension in the water column can cause cavitation in xylem, and these emboli-blocked xylem vessels reduce water transport and thus lower K<inf>leaf</inf>. Stomatal conductance typically remains high at mid-day for soybean, suggesting either a mid-day increase in K<inf>leaf</inf> or that photosynthesis may be maintained at the cost of leaf water status, indicative of an anisohydric water management strategy in soybean. This study examined diurnal fluctuations in K<inf>leaf</inf> and Ψ<inf>leaf</inf>, showing a mid-day depression in K<inf>leaf</inf> in a pattern closely reflecting that of Ψ<inf>leaf</inf>, indicating that K<inf>leaf</inf> depression is the result of cavitation in leaf xylem. The diurnal depression of K<inf>leaf</inf> was not prevented by growth at elevated [CO<inf>2</inf>], which lowered stomatal conductance. Diurnal transcription patterns of aquaporin genes showed that a total of 34 genes belonging to 4 aquaporin families were expressed in soybean leaves, of which 22 were differentially expressed between at least two time points. These data suggest that mid-day K<inf>leaf</inf> depression was driven primarily by cavitation at increasing xylem water tensions, but that aquaporins are also likely involved in diurnal regulation of soybean leaf water status. It is further concluded that because soybean photosynthesis is typically sustained at mid-day, K<inf>leaf</inf> even at the depressed level was in excess of that needed to sustain a stomatal conductance sufficient to prevent depression of photosynthesis in soybean. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cavitation; Diurnal; Leaf hydraulic conductance; Leaf water potential","carbon dioxide; crop production; diurnal activity; gene expression; hydraulic conductivity; photosynthesis; soybean; stomatal conductance; vapor pressure; water management; Glycine max",,,,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Long, S.P., What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO<inf>2</inf> enrichment (FACE)?

In this study, heat waves were imposed on soybean using infrared heating technology in a fully open-air field experiment. Five separate heat waves were applied to field-grown soybean (Glycine max) in central Illinois, three in 2010 and two in 2011. Thirty years of historical weather data from Illinois were analyzed to determine the length and intensity of a regionally realistic heat wave resulting in experimental heat wave treatments during which day and night canopy temperatures were elevated 6 °C above ambient for 3 days. Heat waves were applied during early or late reproductive stages to determine whether and when heat waves had an impact on carbon metabolism and seed yield. By the third day of each heat wave, net photosynthesis (A), specific leaf weight (SLW), and leaf total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration (TNC) were decreased, while leaf oxidative stress was increased. However, A, SLW, TNC, and measures of oxidative stress were no different than the control ca. 12 h after the heat waves ended, indicating rapid physiological recovery from the high-temperature stress. That end of season seed yield was reduced (~10%) only when heat waves were applied during early pod developmental stages indicates the yield loss had more to do with direct impacts of the heat waves on reproductive process than on photosynthesis. Soybean was unable to mitigate yield loss after heat waves given during late reproductive stages. This study shows that short high-temperature stress events that reduce photosynthesis and increase oxidative stress resulted in significant losses to soybean production in the Midwest, U.S. The study also suggests that to mitigate heat wave-induced yield loss, soybean needs improved reproductive and photosynthetic tolerance to high but increasingly common temperatures.","Heat stress;

The leaf water needs of soybean change over time because of large microenvironment changes over their lifespan, as leaves mature in full sun at the top of the canopy and then become progressively shaded by younger leaves developing above. Leaf hydraulic conductance (K leaf), a measure of the leaf's water transport capacity, can often be linked to changes in microenvironment and transpiration demand. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that K leaf would decline in coordination with transpiration demand as soybean leaves matured and aged. Photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (g s) and leaf water potential (Ψleaf) were also measured at various leaf ages with both field- and chamber-grown soybeans to assess transpiration demand. K leaf was found to decrease as soybean leaves aged from maturity to shading to senescence, and this decrease was strongly correlated with midday A. Decreases in K leaf were further correlated with decreases in g s, although the relationship was not as strong as that with A. Separate experiments investigating the response of K leaf to drought demonstrated no acclimation of K leaf to drought conditions to protect against cavitation or loss of g s during drought and confirmed the effect of leaf age in K leaf observed in the field. These results suggest that the decline of leaf hydraulic conductance as leaves age keeps hydraulic supply in balance with demand without K leaf becoming limiting to transpiration water flux. © 2014 © The Author 2014.

However, it is not known if gas exchange and hydraulics will have co-ordinated responses to climate change. The objective of this study was to investigate the responses of leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) in Glycine max (soybean) to growth at elevated [CO2] and increased temperature compared with the responses of leaf gas exchange and leaf water status.MethodsTwo controlled-environment growth chamber experiments were conducted with soybean to measure Kleaf, stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthesis (A) during growth at elevated [CO2] and temperature relative to ambient levels. These results were validated with field experiments on soybean grown under free-air elevated [CO2] (FACE) and canopy warming.Key resultsIn chamber studies, Kleaf did not acclimate to growth at elevated [CO 2], even though stomatal conductance decreased and photosynthesis increased. Growth at elevated temperature also did not affect Kleaf, although gs and A showed significant but inconsistent decreases. The lack of response of Kleaf to growth at increased [CO2] and temperature in chamber-grown plants was confirmed with field-grown soybean at a FACE facility.ConclusionsLeaf hydraulic and leaf gas exchange responses to these two climate change factors were not strongly linked in soybean, although gs responded to [CO2] and increased temperature as previously reported. This differential behaviour could lead to an imbalance between hydraulic supply and transpiration demand under extreme environmental conditions likely to become more common as global climate continues to change. © The Author 2013.","climate change; elevated CO2; Glycine max; Leaf hydraulic conductance; soybean; temperature; water potential","acclimation; carbon dioxide; climate change; environmental conditions; gas exchange; growth; hydraulic conductivity; photosynthesis; soybean; temperature effect; transpiration",,,,,,"Aasamaa, K., Niinemets, U., Sõber, A., Leaf hydraulic conductance in relation to anatomical and functional traits during Populus tremula leaf ontogeny (2005) Tree Physiology, 25, pp. 1409-1418; Ainsworth, E.A., Long, S.P., What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)?Ameta-analytic reviewof the responses of photosyn thesis, canopy properties and plant production to rising CO2 (2005) New Phytologist, 165, pp. 351-371; Allen Jr., L.H., Pan, D., Boote, K.J., Pickering, N.B., Jones, J.W., Carbon dioxide and temperature effects on evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of soybean (2003) Agronomy Journal, 95, pp. 1071-1981; Bernacchi, C.J., Kimball, B.A., Quarles, D.R., Long, S.P., Ort, D.R., Decreases in stomatal conductance of soybean under open-air elevation of [CO2] are closely coupled with decreases in ecosystem evapotranspiration (2007) Plant Physiology, 143, pp. 134-144; Brodribb, T.J., Holbrook, N.M., Changes in leaf hydraulic conductance during leaf shedding in seasonally dry tropical forest (2003) New Phytologist, 158, pp. 295-303; Brodribb, T.J., Holbrook, N.M., Diurnal depression of leaf hydraulic conductance in a tropical tree species (2004) Plant, Cell and Environment, 27, pp. 820-827; Brodribb, T.J., Jordan, G.J., Internal coordination between hydraulics and stomatal control in leaves (2008) Plant, Cell and Environment, 31, pp. 1557-1564; Brodribb, T.J., Jordan, G.J., Water supply and demand remain balanced during leaf acclimation of Nothofagus cunninghamii trees (2011) New Phytologist, 192, pp. 437-448; Brodribb, T.J., Feild, T.S., Jordan, G.J., Leaf maximum photosynthetic rate and venation are linked by hydraulics (2007) Plant Physiology, 144, pp. 1890-1898; Bunce, J.A., Growth at elevated carbon dioxide concentration reduces hydraulic conductance in alfalfa and soybean (1996) Global Change Biology, 2, pp. 155-158; Bunce, J.A., Ziska, L.H., Decreased hydraulic conductance in plants at elevated carbon dioxide (1998) Plant, Cell and Environment, 21, pp. 121-126; Cohen, J.E., (1988) Statisticalpoweranalysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Hillsdale, NJ Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc; Domec, J.-C., Palmroth, S., Ward, E., Maier, C.A., Thérézien, M., Oren, R., Acclimation of leaf hydraulic conductance and stomatal conductance of Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) to long-term growth in elevated CO2 (free-air CO2 enrichment) and N-fertilization (2009) Plant, Cell and Environment, 32, pp. 1500-1512; Flexas, J., Barbour, M.M., Brendel, O., Mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO2: An unappreciated central player in photosynthesis (2012) Plant Science 193-194, pp. 70-84; (2010) Food and Agricultural Commodities Production, , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

At current atmospheric [CO2] levels Rubisco is not saturated; consequently, elevating [CO2] increases the velocity of carboxylation and inhibits the competing oxygenation reaction which is also catalyzed by Rubisco. In the future, leaf photosynthesis (A) should be increasingly limited by RuBP regeneration, as [CO2] is predicted to exceed 550 ppm by 2050. The C3cycle enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7 bisphosphatase (SBPase, EC 3.1.3.17) has been shown to exert strong metabolic control over RuBP regeneration at light saturation.Results: We tested the hypothesis that tobacco transformed to overexpressing SBPase will exhibit greater stimulation of A than wild type (WT) tobacco when grown under field conditions at elevated [CO2] (585 ppm) under fully open air fumigation. Growth under elevated [CO2] stimulated instantaneous A and the diurnal photosynthetic integral (A') more in transformants than WT. There was evidence of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated [CO2] via downregulation of Vc,maxin both WT and transformants. Nevertheless, greater carbon assimilation and electron transport rates (J and Jmax) for transformants led to greater yield increases than WT at elevated [CO2] compared to ambient grown plants.Conclusion: These results provide proof of concept that increasing content and activity of a single photosynthesis enzyme can enhance carbon assimilation and yield of C3crops grown at [CO2] expected by the middle of the 21st century. © 2011 Rosenthal et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","C3 plants; Climate change; Electron transport; Improving photosynthesis; Photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle; RuBP regeneration","Nicotiana tabacum; carbon; carbon dioxide; phosphatase; sedoheptulose bisphosphatase; sedoheptulose-bisphosphatase; article; biomass; enzymology; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; plant leaf; tobacco; transgenic plant; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Tobacco",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; phosphatase, 9013-05-2; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, 3.1.3.-; sedoheptulose-bisphosphatase, 3.1.3.37",,,,"Farquhar, G.D., von Caemmerer, S., Berry, J.A., A biochemical model of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in leaves of C3 species (1980) Planta, 149 (1), pp. 78-90; Sharkey, T.D., O2 insensitive photosynthesis in C3 plants -it's occurence and a possible explanation (1985) Plant Physiology, 78 (1), pp. 71-75. , 10.1104/pp.78.1.71, 1064678, 16664211; Cavagnaro, T.R., Gleadow, R.M., Miller, R.E., Plant nutrient acquisition and utilisation in a high carbon dioxide world (2011) Functional Plant Biology, 38 (2), pp. 87-96; Summary for Policy Makers (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group 1 to the Fourth Assesment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge, UK and New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, Solomon S, Quin D, Manning M, Chen Z, Marquis M, Averyt KB, Tignor M, Miller HL, IPCC; Le Quere, C., Raupach, M.R., Canadell, J.G., Marland, G., Bopp, L., Ciais, P., Conway, T.J., Foster, P., Trends in the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (2009) Nature Geoscience, 2 (12), pp. 831-836; Drake, B.G., Gonzalez-Meler, M.A., Long, S.P., More efficient plants: A consequence of rising atmospheric CO2?
