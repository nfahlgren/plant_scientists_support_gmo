However, we consider the technology not as a 'silver bullet' or panacea for crop improvement in the developing world but as an increasingly important tool that can be used to complement conventional methods of crop improvement. The number of bioengineered crops ready for commercial release in developing countries is expected to expand considerably in the next few years. But the multi-national life sciences companies that are leading the research, development and commercialization of bioengineered crops focus primarily on major crops that have high commercial value and extensive international markets. These companies also hold proprietary gene technology for many other crops of extreme importance to subsistence and resource-poor farmers but do not pursue product development and commercialization because of low anticipated returns. Such crops have traditionally been overlooked and are sometimes referred to as 'orphan crops' because of the relative lack of research and development applied to them. We propose a strategy for the development and delivery of bioengineered crops, including orphan crops, for developing countries. Consulting local public and private sector stakeholders to determine their highest priority needs for agricultural products is the first step. This ensures local stakeholder buy-in and that we do not invest in technology that is unlikely to be adopted. Next, the feasibility of developing and delivering the product is assessed. If the result is positive, the work is organized into 'product commercialization packages' (PCPs) that integrate all elements of the research, development and commercialization processes. The main elements of each PCP include (i) technology development; (ii) policy-related issues such as intellectual property and licensing, as well as gaining regulatory approval by the relevant national authorities; (iii) providing public information to producers and consumers about the benefits, risks and correct management of these new products; and (iv) establishing, or verifying, the existence of marketing and distribution mechanisms to provide farmers access to planting material. Our strategy involves integration of needs-based capacity building, socio-economic impact studies and product stewardship into each PCP. Whenever appropriate, opportunities are sought to create public-private partnerships to help leverage public funds, help absorb development costs and provide a broader distribution channel. To illustrate how our strategy is being translated into action we include, as a case study, examples of work by the US Agency for International Development-funded, Cornell University-led Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project II on the research, development and delivery of bioengineered fruit and shoot-borer-resistant eggplant varieties (Solanum melanogena) for South and Southeast Asia. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,"Solanum; Solanum melongena",,,,,,"Baral, K., Roy, B.

Quantitative evaluation of components of resistance, lesion number and lesion diameter, has been useful for determining quantitative resistance, but few breeders have applied these methods in routine selection programs. This study was aimed at determining the heritability and gain from selection for resistance to the bacterial spot pathogen based on three components of resistance. Random selections from a diverse intermated population of Capsicum annuum L. were self-pollinated for two generations to create S1 and S2 families. Thirty S1 families, corresponding S2 families and four homozygous check lines were evaluated. At forty-two days after seeding, two different leaves of each plant were inoculated by leaf infiltration with low concentrations (5×103 colony forming units) of Group 2 (XCV PT, race 1) and 4 (XCV P, race 1) of the bacterium, respectively. After 15 days, lesion number cm-2 and lesion diameter were measured. Total lesion area was calculated. Narrow-sense heritabilities for lesion number, lesion diameter, and total lesion area were 0, 43, and 31%, respectively, with Group 2, and 26, 43, and 33%, respectively, with Group 4. Actual S2 gain from 20% selection pressure in the S1 was approximately 50%, when selection towards resistance was based on total lesion area. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","bacterial spot; Capsicum annuum; disease screening; horizontal resistance; non-hypersensitive response; pepper; Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria",,,,,,,"Bonas, U., Stall, R.E., Staskawicz, B., Genetic and structural characterization of the avirulence gene avrBs3 from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (1989) Mol.

The map is comprised of 135 loci corresponding to clones selected from a PstI genomic library. This molecular map covers 1,389 cM of the rice genome and exceeds the current classical maps by more than 20%. The map was generated from F2 segregation data (50 individuals) from a cross between an indica and javanica rice cultivar. Primary trisomics were used to assign linkage groups to each of the 12 rice chromosomes. Seventy-eight percent of the clones assayed revealed RFLPs between the two parental cultivars, indicating that rice contains a significant amount of RFLP variation. Strong correlations between size of hybridizing restriction fragments and level of polymorphism indicate that a significant proportion of the RFLPs in rice are generated by insertions/delections. This conclusion is supported by the occurrence of null alleles for some clones (presumably created by insertion or deletion events). One clone, RG229, hybridized to sequences in both the indica and javanica genomes, which have apparently transposed since the divergence of the two cultivars from their last common ancestor, providing evidence for sequence movement in rice. As a by product of this mapping project, we have discovered that rice DNA is less C-methylated than tomato or maize DNA. Our results also suggest the notion that a large fraction of the rice genome (approximately 50%) is single copy. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","DNA methylalion; Genetic map; Molecular markers; Oryza sativa; RFLP; Trisomies",,,,,,,"Allard, R.W., Formulas and tables to facilitate the calculation of recombination values in heredity (1956) Hilgardia, 24, pp. 235-278; Barker, D., Schafer, M., White, R., Restriction sites containing CpG show a higher frequency of polymorphism in human DNA (1984) Cell, 36, pp. 131-138; Beltz, G., Jacobs, K., Eickbush, T., Cheerbas, P., Kafatos, F., Isolation of multigene families and determination of homologies by filter hybridization methods (1983) Methods Enzymol, 100, pp. 266-285; Bennett, M.D., Smith, J.B., Nuclear DNA amounts in angiosperms (1976) Philos Trans R Soc London, Ser B, 274, pp. 227-274; Bernatzky, R., Tanksley, S.D., Toward a saturated linkage map in tomato based on isozymes and random cDNA sequences (1986) Genetics, 112, pp. 887-898; Bernatzky, R., Tanksley, S.D., Majority of random cDNA clones correspond to single loci in the tomato genome (1986) Mol Gen Genet, 203, pp. 8-14; Bonierbale M, Plaisted R, Tanksley SD (1988) Construction of comparative genetic maps of potato and tomato based on a common set of cloned sequences.

The genetic parameters contributing to resistance were estimated by generation means analyses. Additive gene action was the most important genetic component of variation among generation means in all four crosses. Additive by additive effects were significant in one cross and both additive by additive and additive by dominance effects were significant in another. Dominance effects were not significant. The F2/F3 correlations in three crosses ranged from 0.27 to 0.43. Three additional crosses among resistant cultivars were employed to study the effectiveness of selection in improving resistance. By selecting the most resistant plants from the F2 and evaluating the progenies in the F4, increases in resistance ranging from 21% to 31% were obtained. In all crosses, there was transgressive segregation in both directions indicating that the genes conferring resistance to these cultivars differ and exhibit additive effects. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Additive gene action; Disease resistance; Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici; Genetics of resistance; Triticum aestivum L.",,,,,,,"Black, W., The nature and inheritance of field resistance to late blight (Phytophthora infestans) in potatoes (1970) Am Potato, 147, pp. 279-288; Frey, K.J., Horner, T., Heritability in standard units (1957) Agronomy Journal, 49, pp. 59-62; Hautea, R.A., Components and inheritance of slow-mildewing resistance in spring wheat (1986) PhD Thesis, , Cornell University, Ithaca NY; Hooker, A.L., The genetics and expression of resistance in plants to rusts of the genus Puccinia (1967) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 5, pp. 163-182; James, W.C., An illustrated series of assessment keys for plant diseases, their preparation and usage (1971) Can Plant Dis Surv, 51, pp. 39-65; Jones, I.T., Components of adult plant resistance to powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. avenae) in oats (1978) Annals of Applied Biology, 90, pp. 233-239; Krupinsky, J.M., Sharp, E.L., Additive resistance in wheat to Puccinia striiformis (1978) Phytopathology, 68, pp. 1795-1799; Krupinsky, J.M., Sharp, E.L., Reselection for improved resistance of wheat to stripe rust (1979) Phytopathology, 69, pp. 400-404; Kuhn, R.C., Ohm, H.W., Shaner, G.E., Inheritance of slow leaf rusting resistance in Suwon 85 wheat (1980) Crop Science, 20, pp. 655-659; Kumar, S., Singh, R.N., Singh, R.B., Inheritance of slow development of brown rust in wheat (1982) Indian J Agric Sci, 52, pp. 324-330; Lee, T.S., Shaner, G., Oligogenic inheritance of length of latent period in six slow leaf rusting wheat cultivars (1985) Phytopathology, 75, pp. 636-643; Lee, T.S., Shaner, G., Transgressive segregation of length of latent period in crosses between slow leaf rusting wheat cultivars (1985) Phytopathology, 75, pp. 643-647; MacKey, J., Significance of mating system for chromosomes and gametes in polyploids (1970) Hereditas, 6, pp. 165-176; Mather, K., Jinks, J.L., (1977) Introduction to biometrical genetics, , Cornell University Press, Ithaca NY; Parlevliet, J.E., Partial resistance of barley to leaf rust, Puccinia hordei. 4.

Scientists trained in diverse disciplines such as plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy, cereal chemistry, plant physiology, and soil chemistry work together and contribute their specialized skills to this joint endeavor. The program has five interrelated components: (1) germ plasm collection and conservation, (2) research in disciplinary areas, (3) development of improved germ plasm, (4) distribution, evaluation and exchange of germ plasm internationally, (5) training of young scientists. Over forty thousand rice varieties from different countries are being maintained in the IRRI germ plasm bank. These varieties have been screened for grain quality, resistance to various diseases and insects, and tolerance to various environmental stresses such as drought, high and low temperatures and problem soils. Donor parents for resistances to each of the problem areas have been identified. These parents were utilized for developing improved germ plasm. Varieties with resistance to as many as five diseases and five insect species have been developed. These multiple resistant varieties are grown on millions of hectares of rice land. Seeds of improved breeding materials are exchanged internationally and 194 scientists from different countries have been trained in rice improvement work. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.","Disease and Insect Resistance; Germ Plasm Collection; Interdisciplinary Research; International Cooperation; Rice Breeding",,,,,,,"Athwal, D.S., Pathak, M.D., Genetics of resistance to rice insects (1972) Rice Breeding, pp. 375-386. , Intern.
