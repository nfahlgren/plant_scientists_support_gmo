Ingestion of the cactus can result in hallucinations due to its content of mescaline. In the United States, L. williamsii is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. In this study, we use DNA analysis of the chloroplast trnL/trnF region and chloroplast rbcL gene to identify the individuals of Lophophora. Using the rbcL gene, Lophophora specimens could be distinguished from outgroups, but species within the genus could not be distinguished. The trnL/trnF region split the Lophophora genus into several groups based on the length and substructure of an AT-rich segment of the sequence. Our results indicate that the genetic variability at the trnL/trnF locus is greater than previously recognized. Although DNA structures at the trnL/trnF region and rbcL gene do not align with the classification of Lophophora species, they can be used to aid in forensic analysis. © 2015 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","Lophophora; Base sequence; DNA typing; Forensic science; Mescaline; Peyote; Polymerase chain reaction; rbcL locus; trnL/trnF locus",,,,,,,,"Murphy, T.M.",,,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",,,,,00221198,,JFSCA,,"English","J.

The plant is used, often by chewing or smoking, as a ""recreational"" drug source and is regulated or banned in several states and countries. We describe a simple DNA technique, polymerase chain reaction of the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit (rbcL) gene, that can distinguish S. divinorum leaf pieces from pieces of tobacco or cannabis. We have also found DNA sequences adjacent to the chloroplast leucine transfer RNA (trnL) gene that are specific to S. divinorum and distinguish it from other horticulturally popular Salvia species.

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA of the samples, we estimated the sizes and determined restriction patterns and base sequences of chloroplast genes, primarily rbcL (gene for the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase). DNA was successfully extracted from all samples, but was limited to sizes of approximately 200-300 base pairs. As expected, the DNA extracted from the samples was identified as coming primarily from flax (Linum usitatissamum L.), but two samples had a significant fraction, and all samples had at least a trace, of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) DNA. Artifacts from the Christmas Cave were thought to date from Roman times, but it was thought possible that some could be much older. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)-based 14C dating confirmed that the samples contained representatives from both the Roman and Chalcolithic periods.

Two analogous glycosylases, oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG) and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG), can start the process by removing oxidized guanine, the most common modification that leads to misreading of DNA. Plants possess genes for both types of glycosylases. We have tested the hypothesis that the two enzymes in plants have diverged in their specificities by inserting the genes for each enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana L. into Escherichia coli strains designed to indicate the frequencies of the six possible single-base changes. Both enzymes retain the ability to reduce the rate of GC → TA transversion mutations. Both enzymes also reduce the frequency of two other base-change mutations, GC → AT and AT → TA. We do not find a divergence in the repair capabilities of the two enzymes, as measured in E. coli, although surprisingly FPG appears to increase the rate of mutations in one particular strain. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, these characteristics may not always unambiguously distinguish some types of rope from others. If rope samples contain cells from the plants of origin, then DNA analysis may prove to be a better way to identify the type of rope obtained from a crime scene. The objective of this project was to develop techniques of DNA analysis that can be used to differentiate between ropes made from Cannabis sativa L. (hemp), Agave sisalana Perrine (sisal), Musa textilis Née (abaca, ""Manila hemp""), Linum usitatissimum L. (flax), and Corchorus olitorus L. (jute). The procedures included extracting the DNA from the rope, performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the extracted DNA as a template, and analyzing the DNA products. A primer pair for PCR, chosen from within a chloroplast gene for the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, was designed to be specific for plant DNA and complementary to the genes from all five plants. The resulting PCR fragments were approximately 771 base pairs long. The PCR fragments, distinguished through base sequence analysis or restriction enzyme analysis, could be used to identify the five different rope types. The procedure provides a useful addition to visual methods of comparing rope samples. © 2008 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","Base sequence; DNA typing; Forensic science; Polymerase chain reaction; Restriction analysis; Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; Rope","cannabis; carboxylase; DNA fragment; oxygenase; ribulose biphosphate carboxylase; unclassified drug; abaca fiber; chloroplast genetics; conference paper; crime; DNA determination; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; fiber; flax; histology; jute; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; restriction mapping; sisal; weapon; Agave; Boehmeria; Cannabis; Corchorus; DNA; DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; Flax; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Musa; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Sequence Analysis, DNA","GENBANK: AJ235801, AJ390068","cannabis, 8001-45-4, 8063-14-7; carboxylase, 9031-55-4; oxygenase, 9037-29-0, 9046-59-7; DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase, 4.1.1.39",,,,"Salfati, C., Bateman, A., Serial homicide: An investigation of behavioral consistency (2005) J Investig Psychol Offender Profiling, 2, pp. 121-44; Catling, D., Grayson, J., (1982) Identification of Natural Fibers., , New York: Chapman and Hall Ltd; McKenna, H., Hearle, J., O'Hear, N., (2004) Handbook of Fibre Rope Technology., , Boca Raton, FL: Woodhead Publishing Limited and CRC Press LLC; Laux, D.L., Identification of a rope by means of a physical match between the cut ends (1984) J Forensic Sci, 29, pp. 1246-8; Chase, M.W., Soltis, D.E., Olmstead, R.G., Morgan, D., Les, D.H., Mishler, B.D., Phylogenetics of seed plants: An analysis of nucleotide sequences from the plastid gene rbcL (1993) Ann Mo Bot Gard, 80, pp. 528-80; Richardson, J.E., Fay, M.F., Cronke, Q.C., Bowman, D., Chase, M.W., A phylogenetic analysis of Rhamnaceae using rbcL and trnL-F plastid DNA sequences (2000) Am J Bot, 87, pp. 1309-24; Taylor, B., Powell, A., Isolation of plant DNA and RNA (1982) BRL Focus, 4, pp. 4-6; Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F., Maniatis, T., (1989) Molecular Cloning. 2nd Edn., , Cold Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; Dahllof, I., Kjelleberg, S., Multivariate optimization of polymerase chain reaction for microbial community analysis (2002) Mar Biotechnol, 4, pp. 423-430; http://tools.neb.com/NEBcutter2/index.php(2003) Vector NTI 9.0 [Computer Program]., , Invitrogen Corporation.

Cupples, J.H. Miller, A set of lacZ mutations in Escherichia coli that allow rapid detection of each of the six base substitutions, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86 (1989) 5345-5349], provides a unique system for quantifying base-change mutations, and the repair processes that limit their establishment, in bacteria under selective and non-selective conditions. We focussed on one strain in which a T → G replacement inactivates the lacZ gene. Reversions of this strain can occur through oxidation of G, leading to G → T transversions. We show that spontaneous reversions occurred both in lactose (selective) and glucose (non-selective) medium. The number of revertants per viable cell was much greater in medium containing lactose or both sugars than glucose alone. In glucose medium, the rate of reversion was highest below 0.6% glucose and strongly inhibited at and above that level. Evidence that reversions occurred through G → T transversions in both lactose and glucose media came from two observations: by sequence analysis of a series of revertants and by comparing the reversion rates in strains possessing and lacking the mutM gene (encoding formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase, FPG). However, the rate of reversion was stimulated by reducing O2 to 1% and inhibited or delayed by increasing O2 to 90%. In mutM- cells grown on glucose medium, the proportion of revertants increased over a 5-day period. In contrast, in mutM+ cells, revertants appeared primarily during the first 2-3 days after plating; few new revertants appeared in the following days. These data imply that base excision repair initiated by FPG was less effective in the first 2 days and more effective later in stationary phase. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These enzymes play analogous roles in the base excision repair pathways of bacteria (FPG) and archaea, yeast, and mammals (OGG). Why have plants retained both genes? We tested one hypothesis by comparing the specificities of Arabidopsis FPG and OGG purified from Escherichia coli expression clones. Using depurinated DNA as substrate, the specific activity of Arabidopsis FPG was higher than that of Arabidopsis OGG. Using DNA oxidized by treatment with light in the presence of methylene blue, the specific activities of Arabidopsis FPG and OGG were equal. Using an oligonucleotide containing one oxoguanine (paired with C) and labeled with fluorescein, the specific activity of Arabidopsis OGG was greater than that of either FPG. The results support the hypothesis that genes for the two enzymes have been retained during evolution of plants for their specialized enzyme activities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We have identified two strains, one containing a Ds insertion in an exon of the gene that codes for oxoguanine glycosylase and one containing a T-DNA insertion in the gene that codes for formamido-pyrimidine glycosylase (both EC 3.2.2.23), and have crossed them to produce the double mutant. The homozygous mutant strains showed no phenotypic difference from the wild type in growth, development or reproductive potential under either normal conditions or conditions known to induce the formation of ROS. The lack of phenotype may be ascribed to the redundant nature of the base excision repair pathway in Arabidopsis. Longer multigenerational studies may be needed to determine the quantitative selective advantage of individual DNA glycosylase genes.

In root nodules of Datisca glomerata (Datiscaceae), transcripts hybridizing to a conserved coding region of the abundant nodule isoform, DgGS1-1, are abundant in uninfected nodule cortical tissue, but expression was not detectable in the infected zone or in the nodule meristem. Similarly, the GS holoprotein is immunolocalized exclusively to the uninfected nodule tissue. Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length cDNA of DgGS1-1 indicates affinities with cytosolic GS genes from legumes, the actinorhizal species Alnus glutinosa, and nonnodulating species, Vitis vinifera and Hevea brasilensis. The D. glomerata nodule GS expression pattern is a new variant among reported root nodule symbioses and may reflect an unusual nitrogen transfer pathway from the Frankia nodule microsymbiont to the plant infected tissue, coupled to a distinctive nitrogen cycle in the uninfected cortical tissue. Arg, Gln, and Glu are the major amino acids present in D. glomerata nodules, but Arg was not detected at high levels in leaves or roots. Arg as a major nodule nitrogen storage form is not found in other root nodule types except in the phylogenetically related Coriaria. Catabolism of Arg through the urea cycle could generate free ammonium in the uninfected tissue where GS is expressed.",,"DNA; Enzymes; Nitrogen; Physiology; Synthesis (chemical); Tissue; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrogen transfer; Plants (botany); glutamate ammonia ligase; primer DNA; article; classification; cucumber; cytosol; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; plant root; plant seed; Base Sequence; Cucurbitaceae; Cytosol; DNA Primers; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Roots; Seeds; Alnus; Alnus glutinosa; Betulaceae; Coriaria; Datisca glomerata; Datiscaceae; Embryophyta; Eukaryota; Frankia; Hevea; Hevea brasiliensis; Rhizobiaceae; Vitis; Vitis sp.; Vitis vinifera","GENBANK: AY422224, AY422225","glutamate ammonia ligase, 9023-70-5; DNA Primers; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase, EC 6.3.1.2",,,,"Allaway, D., Lodwig, E.M., Crompton, L.A., Wood, M., Parsons, R., Wheeler, T.R., Poole, P.S., Identification of alanine dehydrogenase and its role in mixed secretion of ammonium and alanine by pea bacteroids (2000) Mol Microbiol, 36, pp. 508-515; Baker, A., Parsons, R., Rapid assimilation of recently fixed N2 in root nodules of Myrica gale (1997) Physiol Plantarum, 99, pp. 640-647; Becker, T.W., Caboche, M., Carrayol, E., Hirel, B., Nucteotide sequence of a tobacco cDNA encoding plastidic glutamine synthetase and light inducibility, organ specificity and diurnal rhythmicity in the expression of the corresponding genes of tobacco and tomato (1992) Plant Mol Biol, 19, pp. 367-379; Bennett, M.J., Cullimore, J.V., Glutamine synthetase isozymes of Phaseolus vulgaris L.: Subunit composition in developing root nodules and plumulus (1989) Planta, 179, pp. 433-440; Bennett, M.J., Lightfoot, D.A., Cullimore, J.V., cDNA sequence and differential expression of the gene encoding the glutamine synthetase and polypeptide of Phaseolus vulgaris L.

Glycosylation of stilbenes increases their solubility and may make them more easily absorbed by the intestine. We have found an activity in extracts of cultured cells of Vitis vinifera (cv. Gamay Freaux) that glucosylates the stilbene resveratrol to form piceid. The Km for UDP-Glucose was 1.2 mM, and the Km for resveratrol was 0.06 mM, values similar to those of other phenolic glucosyltransferases. We investigated the resveratrol glucosylating activity of the enzyme extracted from cells grown under different light treatments (dark, visible light, light + ultraviolet (UVC) radiation) and found the activity to be unaffected or slightly reduced. In contrast, UVC light strongly stimulated extractable quercetin glucosyltransferase activity. These results, combined with analysis of phenolic compounds extracted from the differently treated cells, suggest that the resveratrol glucosyltransferase is distinct from the glucosyltransferase(s) active on other phenolics.","Glucosyltransferase; Resveratrol; Stilbene; Vitis vinifera","glucosyltransferase; piceid; polyphenol; resveratrol; stilbene derivative; uridine diphosphate glucose; article; cell suspension; enzyme activity; glycosylation; grape; high performance liquid chromatography; nonhuman; ultraviolet radiation; Cells, Cultured; Flavonoids; Fruit; Glucosyltransferases; Glycosylation; Phenols; Stilbenes; Vitis; Vitis; Vitis sp.; Vitis vinifera",,"glucosyltransferase, 9031-48-5; piceid, 27208-80-6; polyphenol, 37331-26-3; resveratrol, 501-36-0; uridine diphosphate glucose, 133-89-1; Flavonoids; Glucosyltransferases, 2.4.1.-; Phenols; Stilbenes; polyphenols; resveratrol, 501-36-0",,,,"Langcake, P., Pryce, R.J., The production of resveratrol by Vitis vinifera and other Members of the Vitaceae as a response to infection or injury (1976) Physiol.

Seedlings of the chilling-tolerant (V3327) cultivar of mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) were employed to study the mechanism of H 2O2-induced chilling tolerance. Pretreatment with 200 mM H2O2 increased survival rates of seedlings chilled at 4°C for 36 h from 30% to 70%. The same treatment also lowered the electrolyte leakage from 86% to 21%. Time-course analysis immediately after the treatment demonstrated that exogenous application of H2O2 did not alter the endogenous H2O2 level of the plants. This observation suggests that the primary receptor for the exogenous H 2O2 is localized on the leaf surface or in some other way isolated from the endogenous H2O2 pool. Oxidative shock inhibited the induction of the antioxidant enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase; however, it substantially increased glutathione content both under chilling and control conditions. Combined pretreatment of mung bean plants with abscisic acid and H2O2 showed no synergistic effect on glutathione content and decreased survival rate relative to treatment with either compound alone. These results suggest that the H2O 2-induced chilling tolerance in these plants might be mediated by an elevation of glutathione content and is independent of the ABA mechanism of chilling protection.","Abscisic acid; Ascorbate peroxidase; Catalase; Glutathione; Hydrogen peroxide; Mung bean (Vigna radiata L.)","Antioxidants; Enzymes; Hormones; Hydrogen peroxide; Seed; Chilling tolerance; Plants (botany); cold tolerance; Phalaenopsis; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Vigna; Vigna radiata var. radiata",,,,,,"Adams, D.O., Liyanage, C., Modification of an enzymatic glutathione assay for determination of total glutathione in grapevine tissues (1991) American Journal of Enology and Viticulture, 42, pp. 137-140; Anderson, M.E., Determination of glutathione and glutathione disulfide in biological samples (1985) Methods in Enzymology, 113, pp. 548-555; Anderson, J.V., Chevone, B.I., Hess, J.L., Seasonal variation in the antioxidant system of eastern white pine needles (1992) Plant Physiology, 98, pp. 501-508; Anderson, M.D., Prasad, T.K., Stewart, C.R., Changes in isozyme profiles of catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase during acclimation to chilling in mesocotyls of maize seedlings (1995) Plant Physiology, 109, pp. 1247-1257; Asada, K., The water-water cycle in chloroplasts: Scavenging of active oxygens and dissipation of excess photons (1999) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 50, pp. 601-639; Badiani, M., Paolacci, A.R., D'nnibale, A., Sermanni, G.G., Antioxidants and photosynthesis in the leaves of Triticum durum L. seedlings acclimated to low, non-chilling temperature (1993) Journal of Plant Physiology, 142, pp. 18-24; Bowler, C., Montagu, M.V., Inze, D., Superoxide dismutase and stress tolerance (1992) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 24, pp. 83-116; Bradford, M.M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding (1976) Analytical Biochemistry, 72, pp. 248-254; Cano, A., Hernandze-Ruiz, J., Garcia-Canovas, F., Acosta, M., Arnao, M.B., An end-point method for estimation of the total antioxidant activity in plant material (1998) Phytochemical Analysis, 9, pp. 196-202; Chen, Z., Silva, H., Klessig, R.F., Active oxygen species in the induction of plant systemic acquired resistance by SA (1993) Science, 262, pp. 1883-1886; Desikan, R., Hancock, J.T., Coffey, M.J., Neill, S.J., Generation of active oxygen in elicited cells of Arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by a NADPH oxidase-like enzyme (1996) FEBS Letters, 382, pp. 213-217; Desikan, R., Reynolds, A., Hancock, J.T., Neill, S.J., Harpin and hydrogen peroxide both initiate programmed cell death but have differential effects on defence gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cultures (1998) Biochemical Journal, 330, pp. 115-120; Elstner, E.F., Mechanisms of oxygen activation in different compartments of plant cells (1991) Active Oxygen/oxidative Stress and Plant Metabolism, pp. 13-25. , Eds EJ Pell and KL Steffen.

These studies were conducted as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems Key Program, which investigated various aspects of grassland productivity and sustainability between 1996 and 2001. Grasslands in this study either had high contents of Themeda australis or Austrodanthonia spp., or were based on a degraded Austrodanthonia spp. grassland with a high content of annual and weedy species. All sites used increasing levels of superphosphate application (nil, low, medium and high) as treatments, with clover being added in some treatments at 1 site, and herbicide in 1 treatment at another site. Grazing (sheep) was continuous at 1 site (with stocking rates matched to pasture productivity) and intermittent at other sites, with grazing being dictated by available herbage between defined trigger points. Climate was monitored and changes in soil P, herbage mass, botanical composition, ground cover and sheep production recorded. Changes in composition resulting from the treatments varied between sites. At the continuously grazed Austrodanthonia spp. site, there was a decline in native perennial grasses throughout the experiment and an increase in exotic annual grasses in spring where superphosphate was applied. The grassland at the T. australis site remained relatively stable, which may have been due to the limited amount of grazing applied. The degraded Austrodanthonia spp. grassland showed wide seasonal fluctuations in annual species. There were no clear effects of treatments at the latter 2 sites. Sheep production increased with increased superphosphate application at the continuously grazed Austrodanthonia spp. site, but there was little effect at the other 2 sites. Recommendations are made for sustainable management of native grasslands depending on their current botanical state.",,"fertilizer application; grassland; grazing; productivity; species diversity; Australia; Animalia; Austrodanthonia; Ovis aries; Poaceae; Themeda australis; Trifolium",,,,,,"Allcock, K.G., Effects of phosphorus on growth and competitive interactions of native and introduced species found in White Box woodlands (2002) Austral Ecology, 27, pp. 638-646; Andrew, M.H., Lodge, G.M., The Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment. 1.

TN5, a chilling-sensitive cultivar) was employed to evaluate the importance of glutathione in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced chilling tolerance. Seeds germinated at 25°C for 7 d were subjected to different periods of chilling treatment, prior to analysis of the glutathione contents of their leaves. In a comparison of acclimation temperatures from 2-12°C, it was found that an 8°C acclimation for 36 h induced a 5.7-fold increase, the highest glutathione level among the temperatures tested. Seedlings acclimated at 8°C for 36 h showed 97% survival after a 36-h, 4°C chilling stress, compared with 33% survival of non-acclimated plants. Pretreatment with 200 mM H2O2 for 12 h before a 36-h, 4°C chilling treatment increased glutathione levels by 30% and reduced electrolyte leakage to 43%, relative to the untreated control. Treated seedlings also showed a survival rate of 71% after the same chilling treatment. Application of 1 mM buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, reversed the protection against chilling stress provided to seedlings either by acclimation at 8°C for 36 h or H2O2 pretreatment. The role of glutathione in chilling acclimation or H2O2-pretreatment-induced chilling tolerance is thus confirmed.","Acclimation; Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO); Chilling; Glutathione; Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); Mung bean","Cold effects; Hydrogen peroxide; Organic compounds; Seedlings; Crops; cold tolerance; legume; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Vigna; Vigna radiata var. radiata",,,,,,"Adams, D.O., Liyanage, C., Modification of an enzymatic glutathione assay for determination of total glutathione in grapevine tissues (1991) American Journal of Enology Viticulture, 42, pp. 137-140; Anderson, J.V., Chevone, B.I., Hess, J.L., Seasonal variation in the antioxidant system of eastern white pine needles (1992) Plant Physiology, 98, pp. 501-508; Anderson, M.D., Prasad, T.K., Martin, B.A., Stewart, C.R., Differential gene expression in chilling acclimated maize seedlings and evidence for the involvement of abscisic acid in chilling tolerance (1994) Plant Physiology, 105, pp. 331-339; Anderson, M.D., Prasad, T.K., Stewart, C.R., Changes in isozyme profiles of catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase during acclimation to chilling in mesocotyls of maize seedlings (1995) Plant Physiology, 109, pp. 1247-1257; Anderson, M.E., Determination of glutathione and glutathione disulfide in biological samples (1985) Methods in Enzymology, 113, pp. 548-555; Asada, K., Endo, T., Mano, J., Miyake, C., Molecular mechanism for relaxation of and protection from light stress (1998) Stress responses of photosynthetic organisms, pp. 37-52. , Eds K Satoh and N Murata.

Thus, AtMMH, like at least four other genes in the base excision repair pathway of human cells, produces multiple forms of protein product through alternative splicing. The variant forms of Arabidopsis FPG may be localized in different locations in the cells, may have different preferences for oxidized substrates, and/or may recruit different proteins that guide the subsequent steps of base excision repair. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The enzyme showed strong similarity to a plasma membrane NADH oxidase ('superoxide synthase' as assayed by lucigenin chemiluminescence; T. M. Murphy and C.-K. Auh, Plant Physiol. 110: 621-629, 1996) in its response to substrate, to Triton X-100, and to diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of mammalian neutrophil NADPH oxidase and other flavoenzymes. However, its fluorescence spectrum was not characteristic of flavins and instead was similar to that of pterins. Thus inhibition of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction by diphenylene iodonium does not necessarily imply that the reaction is catalyzed by NADPH oxidase or another flavoenzyme. Superoxide synthesis catalyzed by the enzyme preparation was very low but could be increased at least twofold by the addition of a quinone, menadione. This suggests the enzyme acting in conjunction with a natural quinone could produce activated oxygen species in stressed plant cells.","Diphenylene iodonium; Fluorescence spectrum; NADH oxidase; Oxidative burst; Pterin; Rosa damascena","chemiluminescence; diphenylene iodonium; enzyme purification; fluorescence; lucigenin; menadione; NADH specific oxidation reduction enzyme; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; reaction mechanism",,,,,,"Auh, C.-K., Murphy, T.M., Plasma membrane redox enzyme is involved in the synthesis of O2 - and H2O2 by Phytophthora elicitor-stimulated rose cells (1995) Plant Physiol, 107, pp. 1241-1247; Baker, C.J., Deahl, K., Domek, J., Orlandi, E.W., Oxygen metabolism in plant/bacteria interactions: Effect of DPI on the pseudo-NAD(P)H oxidase activity of peroxidase (1998) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 252, pp. 461-464; Barcelo, A.R., The generation of H2O2 in the xylem of Zinnia elegans is mediated by an NADPH-oxidase-like enzyme (1998) Planta, 207, pp. 207-216; Barcelo, A.R., Use and misuse of peroxidase inhibitors (1998) Trends Plant Sci, 3, p. 418; Barr, R., Pan, R.S., Crane, F.L., Brightman, A.O., Morre, D.J., Destruction of vitamin K1 of cultured carrot cells by ultraviolet radiation and its effect on plasma membrane electron transport reactions (1992) Biochem Int, 27, pp. 449-456; Bolwell, G.P., Davies, D.R., Gerrish, C., Auh, C.-K., Murphy, T.M., Comparative biochemistry of the oxidative burst produced by rose and French bean cells reveals two distinct mechanisms (1998) Plant Physiol, 116, pp. 1379-1385; Desikan, R., Hancock, J.T., Coffey, M.J., Neill, S.J., Generation of active oxygen in elicited cells of Arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by a NADPH oxidase-like enzyme (1996) FEBS Lett, 382, pp. 213-217; Doke, N., Miura, Y., Sanchez, L.M., Park, H.J., Noritake, T., Yoshioka, H., Kawakita, K., The oxidative burst protects plants against pathogen attack-mechanism and role as an emergency signal for plant biodefence: A review (1994) Gene, 179, pp. 45-51; Dwyer, S.C., Legendre, L., Low, P.S., Leto, T.L., Plant and human neutrophil oxidative burst complexes contain immunologically related proteins (1996) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1289, pp. 231-237; Frahry, G., Schopfer, P., Inhibition of O2-reducing activity of horseradish peroxidase by diphenyleneiodonium (1998) Phytochemistry, 48, pp. 223-227; Hammond-Kosack, K.E., Jones, J.D.G., Resistance gene-dependent plant defense responses (1996) Plant Cell, 8, pp. 1773-1791; Lamb, C., Dixon, R.A., The oxidative burst in plant disease resistance (1997) Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol, 48, pp. 251-275; Larsson, C., Partition in aqueous polymer two-phase systems: A rapid method for separation of membrane particles according to their surface properties (1983), pp. 279-309. , Hall JL, Moore AL (eds) Isolation of membranes and organelles from plant cells.

A second message of 3000 nucleotides was observed only in nodules. Both size classes of transcripts were polyadenylated. The larger transcript was 2- to 5-fold more abundant than the mature mRNA; it was hybridized to an intronic probe, indicating that a stable, incompletely spliced transcript was accumulating. Treatment with light on excised nodules did not alter the relative abundance of the species. In situ hybridization the Dgrca message was expressed intensely in the nuclei of infected cells. The Dgrca transcript also accumulated at lower levels in uninfected cortical cells adjacent to the periderm and the vascular cylinder. mRNA encoding the large subunit of Rubisco (DgrcL) was abundant in mature infected cells and in the amyloplast-rich sheath of uninfected cortical cells lying between the infected cells and nodule periderm. The proteins Rubisco activase, Rubisco, and the 33-kD O2-evolving complex subunit did not accumulate to detectable levels, indicating that a functional photosynthetic apparatus was not prevalent in nodule tissue.

Each assay ascribed the highest activity to a different preparation: the Cyt c assay to cytosol, the nitroblue tetrazolium assay to plasma membrane, and the lucigenin assay to the partially solubilized plasma membrane protein (with NADH). This suggests that no two assays measure the same set of enzymes and that none of the assays is suitable for comparisons of superoxide synthesis among different cell fractions. With the plasma membrane preparation, the presence of large amounts of superoxide-dismutase-insensitive Cyt c reductase confounded attempts to use Cyt c to measure superoxide synthesis. With the partially solubilized membrane protein, direct reduction of lucigenin probably contributed to the chemiluminescence. Superoxide synthesis detected with lucigenin should be confirmed by superoxide-dismutase-sensitive Cyt c reduction.",,,,,,,,"Auh, C.-K., Murphy, T.M., Plasma membrane redox enzyme is involved in the synthesis of O2 - and H2O2 by Phytophthora elicitor-stimulated rose cells (1995) Plant Physiol, 107, pp. 1241-1247; Bolwell, G.P., Davies, D.R., Gerrish, C., Auh, C.-K., Murphy, T.M., Comparative biochemistry of the oxidative burst produced by rose and French bean cells reveals two distinct mechanisms (1998) Plant Physiol, 116, pp. 1379-1385; Bradford, M.M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding (1976) Anal Biochem, 72, pp. 248-254; Picker, S.D., Fridovich, I., On the mechanism of production of superoxide radical by reaction mixtures containing NAD, phenazine methosulfate, and nitroblue tetrazolium (1984) Arch Biochem Biophys, 228, pp. 155-158; Quail, P.H., Plant cell fractionation (1979) Annu Rev Plant Physiol, 30, pp. 425-484; Vásquez-Vivar, J., Hogg, N., Pritchard Jr., K.A., Martasek, P., Kalyanaraman, B., Superoxide anion formation from lucigenin: An electron spin resonance spin-trapping study (1997) FEBS Lett, 403, pp. 127-130","Murphy, T.M.; Plant Biology Section, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States; email: tmmurphy@ucdavis.edu",,,,,,,,00320889,,PLPHA,,"English","Plant Physiol.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000215014

It has been hypothesized that in rose cells H2O2 is produced by a plasma membrane NAD(P)H oxidase (superoxide synthase), whereas in bean cells H2O2 is derived directly from cell wall peroxidases following extracellular alkalimzation and the appearance of a reductant. In the rose/Phytophthora spp. system treated with N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate, superoxide was detected by a N,N'-dimethyl-9,9′-biacridium dinitrate-dependent chemiluminescence; in contrast, in the bean/C. lindemuthianum system, no superoxide was detected, with or without N,N-diethyldithio-carbamate. When rose cells were washed free of medium (containing cell wall peroxidase) and then treated with Phytophthora spp. elicitor, they accumulated a higher maximum concentration of H2O2 than when treated without the washing procedure. In contrast, a washing treatment reduced the H2O2 accumulated by French bean cells treated with C. lindemuthianum elicitor. Rose cells produced reductant capable of stimulating horseradish (Armoracia lapathifolia) peroxidase to form H2O2 but did not have a peroxidase capable of forming H2O2 in the presence of reductant.

S. and G. (Chlorophyta) were grown in outdoor tanks under UV-B-transparent or UV-B-opaque screens. Growth rates of the segments were measured by changes in surface area. Amounts of chlorophyll a, carotenoids, and UV-absorbing compounds per segment did not vary systematically with treatments, but chlorophyll a and carotenoids per unit weight were higher after growth under UV-B-transparent screens than under UV- B-opaque screens. These results indicate that chlorophyll a and carotenoid synthesis was not inhibited by UV-B. Nitrogen supplementation (10 μM NaNO3) enhanced the growth rates of both UV-B-exposed and -unexposed segments; however this supplementation did not affect the sensitivity of the algal segments to UV-B. Growth rates of Ulva segments grown attached to frames on the mudflats were similar to those measured in the outdoor tanks, supporting the assumption that the effects of UV-B measured in outdoor tanks used in this and other studies are relevant to natural populations.","Carotenoids; Chlorophyll a; Mudflats; Nitrogen supplementation; Outdoor culture; Pigment composition; UV-absorbing substances","carotenoid; chlorophyll a; nitrogen; algae; growth; intertidal zone; pigment composition; ultraviolet radiation; ultraviolet-B; alga; article; marine environment; nonhuman; ozone layer; solar radiation; ultraviolet b radiation; Ulva expansa",,"chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Agrawal, S.B., Effects of supplemental UV-B radiation on photosynthetic pigment, protein and glutathione contents in green algae (1992) Environ.

S. and G. (Chlorophyta) thallus were measured in an indoor tank under controlled photoperiod and UV-B levels. Growth rates in this tank were lower than those in outdoor tanks used in earlier experiments and the response to UV-B was somewhat different, probably because of differences in ratios of PAR:UV- A:UV-B under the artificial conditions. Plastic and total extension of algal segments were measured under defined tensile loads to determine whether UV-B reduced cell wall extensibility. No significant changes in wall extensibility were measured following exposure of tissues to solar UV-B or a range of artificial doses of UV-B. Osmotic potentials of the cell solution did not vary systematically with treatment, even when growth rates between UV-B- exposed and -unexposed segments were significantly different. These results indicate that the UV-induced reduction in cell expansion is effected by some means other than an inhibition of Wall extensibility or a lowering of turgor pressure and argue for a more direct method of control of cell expansion rate.","Cell wall extensibility; Chlorophyta; Growth rate; Osmotic potential; Ultraviolet-B; Ulva expansa","cell expansion; growth rate; ultraviolet-B; alga; article; cell size; environmental radioactivity; growth rate; nonhuman; osmosis; photoperiodicity; radiation dose; radiation exposure; ultraviolet b radiation; Ulva expansa",,,,,,"Biggs, K.J., Fry, S.C., Phenolic cross-linking in the cell wall (1987) Physiology of Cell Expansion During Plant Growth, pp. 46-57. , D.J.

In a first experiment, we attempted to determine whether neonatal sucking was a potent reinforcer in the establishment of this preference by temporarily covering the udders of ewes after parturition. Lambs were assigned to one of three treatments: they had free access to the udder (group 1) or were prevented from sucking either between birth and 6 h afterward (group 2) or between 12 and Is h after birth group 3). Measurements of cholecystokinin plasma levels at birth and at 6 and 18 h showed that all lambs ingested some colostrum when the udder was made accessible. When tested in a two-choice test situation at 24 h of age, lambs from group 1 spent significantly more time near their mothers than near the alien ewes, those from group 2 did not show any discrimination, and lambs from group 3 clearly preferred the alien ewes. At 2 days of age, lambs from groups 1 and 3 showed a strong preference for their mothers, whereas those from group 2 still displayed no preference. In a second experiment, we attempted to determine whether sucking also had a reinforcing value in the maintenance of this preference. Lambs were assigned to one of three treatments: they had free access to the udder (group 1) or were prevented from sucking for 6 h either at birth (group 2) or at the age of 3 days (group 3). Lambs from group 2 did not discriminate between their own and alien dams when tested at 24 h of age, unlike those of groups 1 and 3. When a second test was performed at 4 days of age, all the lambs showed a strong preference for their dams. We concluded that sucking has strong rewarding properties in the establishment of a preferential relationship with the mother by the lamb. On the other hand, the maintenance of this preference does not rely on sucking as strongly.","Cholecystokinin; Lamb; Mother-infant relationship; Neonnte; Preference; Sucking","cholecystokinin; animal experiment; article; blood level; colostrum; controlled study; female; lamb; mother child relation; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; sheep; sucking; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Cholecystokinin; Female; Male; Mothers; Sheep; Sucking Behavior",,"Cholecystokinin, 9011-97-6",,,,"Alexander, G., Williams, D., Maternal facilitation of sucking drive in newborn lambs (1964) Science, 146, pp. 665-666; Alexander, G., Williams, D., Teat-seeking activity in lambs during the first hours of life (1966) Anim.

Having worked in a tertiary referral pain clinic that serves many low back pain patients who have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of chronic opiate therapy, I am strongly ambivalent about recommending prescribing ongoing opioid therapy for chronic pain patients. The caveats about prescribing opioids for such patients are most appropriate (ie, do not prescribe opioids for those who have a history of problems with opioid therapy or for whom increased intake is associated with decreased function); however, for patients who do not display these problems (and there could be many out there), I am sympathetic with the sentiments expressed by Brown et al. A trial of these drugs might be warranted if all else fails and continued therapy with opioids seems justified, but only with zealous attention to monitoring function and therapeutic compliance, as outlined by the authors. With regard to the doses needed for control, the method of opioid administration might be important, that is, whether it is in tablets or in a masking vehicle. In this day of open dialogue, it is not fashionable to blind the patient to the drug or dose, but I believe blinding has a place in the care of a particular group of patients whose symptom (pain) can vary considerably with time. I have found that most chronic pain patients rarely, if ever, reduce their analgesic intake in better times, but an attentive physician can if masking vehicles are used. Thus the physician can limit the amount of drug consumed long term. In my personal experiences with comparable chronic nonmalignant pain patients (albeit in different hemispheres), the average opioid maintenance (methadone) dosage was halved by prescribing the drug in a masking vehicle rather than as a tablet. If pain complaints are reduced and if function is improved according to the record (eg, patient is working) and the relatives' report, and if you, the prescribing physician, are happy, then a long-term regimen of opioid therapy is probably fine. Further controlled trials are needed to see whether this therapy works, and if so, what are the optimal agent(s) and dosages, what is optimal monitoring, and most important of all, who is the optimal patient who might derive not only analgesia but also functional benefit rather than compromise from the therapy. If we cannot make patients better, we must not make them worse.",,"butorphanol; codeine; methadone; morphine; opiate; pentazocine; pethidine; drug efficacy; drug use; editorial; human; low back pain; patient monitoring; prescription; Analgesics, Opioid; Humans; Low Back Pain; Pain Measurement; Treatment Outcome",,"Analgesics, Opioid",,,,,"Murphy, T.M.; University of Washington, Department of Anesthesiology, Box 356540, Seattle, WA 98195-6540, United States",,,,,,,,08938652,,JABPE,8743238,"English","J.

Both activities were inhibited by wavelengths from 254 to 435 nm, with the NADPH-dependent enzyme being more sensitive than the NADH-dependent enzyme. Incubation in the presence of flavin adenine dinucleotide had a small but significant ameliorative effect on the inhibition of the O2 synthase activities of plasma membranes by 300 nm radiation.

Many of the responses involve reactions at the plasma membrane: efflux of K+, changes in the acid balance between cytoplasm and external medium, synthesis of H2O2, and inhibition of ferricyanide reduction. In previous studies, the cells have typically been washed with a solution of low ionic strength. We now show that this washing procedure results in changes in the protein composition of the plasma membrane, in the labeling of the proteins in the plasma membrane, and in the specific activity of ATPase in purified plasma membrane vesicles. Also, compared to the unwashed cells, the washed cells show less net K+ efflux after UV-C and Phytophthora elicitor treatments; more synthesis of H2O2 after UV-C and a pattern of accumulation of H2O2 after elicitor treatment that shows a delayed but higher peak; and more inhibition of ferricyanide reduction after UV-C, but not after elicitor treatment.

Sodium salicylate at 1 mM increased K+ efflux, inhibited the reduction of ferricyanide, and stimulated the synthesis of H2O2 by the cells. Long-term incubation of cells in nutrient agar containing 1 mM salicylate was lethal, although a 6-hr treatment with salicylate, followed by plating, did not reduce plating efficiency. The effects of salicylate on ferricyanide reduction and plating were not observed with m-hydroxybenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate, two isomers of salicylate; in contrast, the effects on K+ efflux and H2O2 synthesis were more pronounced with m-hydroxybenzoate than with salicylate. Neither u.v.-C radiation nor elicitor treatment results in an accumulation of salicylic acid in rose cells, leading to the conclusion that salicylic acid does not serve as a signal compound in the responses of rose cells to these stressors. © 1993.",,,,,,,,"Arnott, Murphy, A comparison of the effects of a fungal elicitor and ultraviolet radiation on ion transport and hydrogen peroxide synthesis by rose cells (1991) Envir. exp.

Gloire de Guilan exhibited normal plasma membrane electron transport activities, including the reduction of extracellular ferricyanide to ferrocyanide, the reduction of Fe(III) chelate, and the oxidation of exogenous NADH. Elicitor preparations from autoclaved cell walls of Phytophthora sp. or from clarified fungal growth medium inhibited ferricyanide reduction (and stimulated ferrocyanide oxidation) by the rose cells. The effect occurred after a lag period of 10-15 min and lasted for at least 60 min. There was no inhibition of reduction of Fe(III) chelate; there was a stimulation of oxidation of exogenous NADH. The effect was observed after a treatment of the cells with salicylate, but not after treatment with ultraviolet radiation or cycloheximide, agents that otherwise mimic the effect of elicitor on rose cell plasma membrane activities. There was no effect of elicitor added in vivo or in vitro on the NADH-ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity of isolated plasma membrane. The inhibition of ferricyanide reduction and oxidation of ferrocyanide could not be attributed to an elicitor-dependent accumulation of O- 2 or H2O2, since added superoxide dismutase and catalase did not block the inhibition of ferricyanide reduction. It is suggested that the inhibition of ferricyanide reduction was related to a change in the redox state of cytoplasmic NADH/NAD+. © 1992.",,,,,,,,"Ames, Assay of inorganic phosphate, total phosphate, and phosphatases (1966) Meth.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of glucocorticoids to inhibit rat AM AA metabolism stimulated by H2O2, as compared to the particulate zymosan. Methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids failed to significantly inhibit release of AA stimulated by H2O2, while markedly reducing AA release in response to zymosan. Similarly, methylprednisolone only weakly inhibited synthesis of thromboxane (Tx)B2 stimulated by H2O2, while inhibiting zymosan-induced eicosanoid to a marked degree. On the other hand, the phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine strongly inhibited AA release and TxB2 formation stimulated by both H2O2 and zymosan, indicating that H2O2-induced AA metabolism is indeed susceptible to pharmacologic inhibition. The failure of glucocorticoids to inhibit AA metabolism stimulated by H2O2 in the AM may in part explain their inability to ameliorate oxidant-mediated lung inflammation and injury.","lung inflammation; mepacrine; methylprednisolone; oxidants; thromboxane; zymosan","arachidonic acid; dexamethasone; fluocinolone; glucocorticoid; hydrogen peroxide; mepacrine; methylprednisolone; radioisotope; thromboxane b2; zymosan; animal cell; article; cell culture; female; inflammation; lung alveolus macrophage; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Animal; Arachidonic Acids; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Cells, Cultured; Eicosanoids; Female; Glucocorticoids; Hydrogen Peroxide; Macrophages; Methylprednisolone; Pulmonary Alveoli; Quinacrine; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Zymosan; Animalia",,"Arachidonic Acids; Eicosanoids; Glucocorticoids; Hydrogen Peroxide, 7722-84-1; Methylprednisolone, 83-43-2; Quinacrine, 83-89-6; Zymosan, 9010-72-4",,"sigma, United States",,,"Sporn, P.H.S.; Div. of Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Univ. of Michigan Med.

The alveolar macrophage (AM) represents an important potential source of these eicosanoids. We have therefore investigated the effects of in vitro hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) versus normoxia (95% air/5% CO2) on the metabolism of AA in the AM of the rat. Exposure to 95% O2 for up to 72 h did not impair the viability or affect the protein content of cultured AMs. Hyperoxia for 24 to 72 h increased the accumulation of free AA liberated from endogenous stores in cultures of resting AMs. Despite this increase in free AA, no changes in synthesis of thromboxane B2, prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 alpha, leukotriene (LT) B4, or LTC4 were observed in resting AMs exposed to hyperoxia for up to 72 h. This was not due to degradation of eicosanoids in hyperoxia. However, formation of cyclooxygenase metabolites from exogenously supplied AA was reduced in hyperoxia-incubated AMs, suggesting that hyperoxia inhibited the cyclooxygenase enzyme. In AMs stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, both AA release and synthesis of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase eicosanoids were augmented after incubation in hyperoxia for 24 to 72 h. The increase in A23187-stimulated LTB4 synthesis caused by hyperoxia was inhibited by the antioxidants catalase, superoxide dismutase, and the intracellular cysteine loading agent L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, suggesting that the augmentation by hyperoxia of A23187-induced AA metabolism was mediated by reactive oxygen metabolites. Thus, hyperoxia has complex effects on AA metabolism in the AM, which include the ability to augment the release of AA and formation of bioactive eicosanoids. These findings support a possible role for eicosanoid synthesis by the AM in the pathogenesis of oxygen toxicity of the lung.",,"antioxidant; arachidonic acid derivative; calcimycin; leukotriene B4; oxygen; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2 alpha; prostaglandin synthase; prostaglandin synthase inhibitor; slow reacting substance; thromboxane B2; animal; article; biosynthesis; cell culture; cytology; female; lung alveolus; macrophage; metabolism; rat; rat strain; Animal; Antioxidants; Arachidonic Acids; Calcimycin; Cells, Cultured; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Dinoprost; Dinoprostone; Female; Leukotriene B4; Macrophages; Oxygen; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase; Pulmonary Alveoli; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; SRS-A; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Thromboxane B2",,"calcimycin, 52665-69-7; leukotriene B4, 71160-24-2; oxygen, 7782-44-7; prostaglandin E2, 363-24-6; prostaglandin F2 alpha, 551-11-1; prostaglandin synthase, 39391-18-9, 59763-19-8, 9055-65-6; thromboxane B2, 54397-85-2; Antioxidants; Arachidonic Acids; Calcimycin, 52665-69-7; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Dinoprost, 551-11-1; Dinoprostone, 363-24-6; Leukotriene B4, 71160-24-2; Oxygen, 7782-44-7; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase, EC 1.14.99.1; SRS-A; Thromboxane B2, 54397-85-2",,,,,"Sporn, P.H.",,,,,,,,10441549,,,2155014,"English","Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025070453

Frequent blood samples were collected from an indwelling intravenous catheter and CSF samples were collected via spinal needles inserted in the cervical (C7-T1 interspace) and lumbar (L3,4 interspace) regions at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 45 min after fentanyl administration. The concentration of fentanyl in blood and CSF samples were quantified by a sensitive and selective gas-liquid chromatography assay. Visual analogue pain scores (VAPS) were recorded every 5 min for the first hour. Coded syringes (one containing the appropriate fentanyl dose while the other contained an equivalent volume of saline) allowed the investigator administering the fentanyl and assessing VAPS to remain blinded as to which route of administration actually contained the fentanyl. There was minimal vascular uptake of fentanyl following epidural administration. Similarly, the permeation of fentanyl into cervical and lumbar CSF following intravenous administration was minimal and erratic such that only 4 of the 60 CSF samples had detectable fentanyl concentrations. In contrast, there was a rapid penetration of fentanyl across the dura mater following lumbar epidural administration. There was significantly fentanyl in lumbar CSF samples by 10 min in 5 patients, and by 20 min in all 6 patients. The mean maximum lumbar CSF concentration was 19.1 ng/ml, while the time associated with these maximum concentrations was 22.5 min. The mean maximum cervical CSF fentanyl concentrations were 10% of the lumbar CSF concentrations. Cervical CSF fentanyl concentrations exceeded 0.5 ng/ml in only 2 of the 6 patients. There was no consistent similarity between the VAPS and time with the two routes of fentanyl administration. However, VAPS always decreased following epidural administration. It is concluded that fentanyl is rapidly absorbed across the dura mater following epidural administration providing significant lumbar CSF concentrations. The fentanyl in lumbar CSF undergoes cephalad migration, albeit to a small extent, as a result of passive CSF flow. The high lumbar CSF fentanyl concentrations interact with the opioid receptors in the dorsal horn region of the spinal cord to provide pain relief. However, the role of cervical fentanyl concentrations to any pharmacological effects remains unresolved. © 1989.","cephalad migration in CSF; CSF pharmacokinetics; Fentanyl","fentanyl; cerebrospinal fluid; chronic pain; clinical article; epidural anesthesia; human; intrathecal drug administration; intravenous drug administration; nociception; priority journal; Fentanyl; Human; Injections, Epidural; Injections, Intravenous; Pain Measurement",,"fentanyl, 437-38-7; Fentanyl, 437-38-7",,,,,"Gourlay, G.K.; Pain Management Unit, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia",,,,,,,,03043959,,PAIND,2812836,"English","Pain",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024423617

In this study, multilamellar dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes were used as a model of structured lipids. The effect of temperature and skin penetration enhancers on the lipid bilayer, was assessed using a spin labelling technique, in which 5-doxyl stearic acid was incorporated into the bilayer. The order parameter (S) of the spin label was calculated from the observed spectra. An increase in temperature decreased the order parameter. This decrease is due to increased rotational movement of the acyl chain of the spin label about its long molecular axis. It indicates a decrease in order within the bilayer structure, as a result of increased flexibility of the lipid molecules. Known skin penetration enhancers, Brij 36T, n-decylmethyl sulphoxide and oleic acid, also decreased the order parameter of the spin label. The penetration enhancer N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone had no significant effect. The results obtained were confirmed using a light scattering technique, in which the phase transition temperature of the liposomes was monitored in the presence and absence of the enhancers. 5-Doxyl stearic acid was incorporated into stratum corneum, separated from human cadaver skin. The spectra obtained were similar to those of the liposomal samples and the application of n-decylmethyl sulphoxide had a similar effect on the order parameter. © 1989.","Electron spin resonance; Phospholipid bilayer; Skin penetration enhancer; Stratum corneum","1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone; bry 36; decyl methyl sulfoxide; liposome; oleic acid; unclassified drug; drug transport; electron spin resonance; human; human cell; model; nonbiological model; priority journal; skin; stratum corneum; temperature",,"1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone, 872-50-4; decyl methyl sulfoxide, 3079-28-5; oleic acid, 112-80-1, 115-06-0","bry 36, fisons, United Kingdom","aldrich, United Kingdom; bdh pharmaceuticals, United Kingdom; cyclo, United States; fisons, United Kingdom",,"Anzai, Utsumi, Inoue, Nojima, Kwan, Electron spin resonance studies on the interaction between liposomal membranes and Triton X-100 (1980) CHEMICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN, 28, pp. 1762-1767; Ashton, Surfactant Effects in Percutaneous Absorption (1987) Ph.D. Thesis, , University of Wales; Bangham, Standish, Watkins, Diffusion of univalent ions across the lamellae of swollen phospholipids (1965) J.

The mean and standard deviation of the proportion of clumps with a given number of mutant cells at a particular time are calculated. Since the standard deviation tends to be much smaller than the mean, the following conclusions can be drawn. Aggregation lowers the number of mutant-containing clumps in cultures grown to a standard number of cells, but raises the number of mutant-containing clumps in cultures grown to a standard number of clumps. In the absence of mutation, or at low mutation rates, clumps tend to become pure types (normal or mutant). The probability of finding pure, nonmutant-containing clumps, however, is approximately the initial fraction of nonmutant cells (given realistic forward and back mutation rates). Also, in terms of the given process, it is possible to compute the probability that all the cells in an aggregate descend from a single, common parent cell within a given number of generations, and thus to calculate the probability that all the cells in a clone grown from an aggregate descend from a single cell within a known number of generations. © 1983.",,"article; biological model; cell aggregation; cell culture; comparative study; mathematics; mutation; plant physiology; species difference; Cell Aggregation; Cells, Cultured; Comparative Study; Mathematics; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Plant Physiology; Species Specificity; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,,,,"King, Street, Growth patterns in cell cultures (1977) Plant Tissue and Cell Culture, p. 308. , H.E.

Tests were performed on 152 tuberculin test positive cattle, 117 of which on post-mortem examination had confirmed M. bovis infection. Seven bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculins were potency tested. The method of assay was based on a four-point dose-response design and three bovine PPD tuberculins were assayed against the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) standard for bovine PPD tuberculin in each group of eight animals. Two dilutions, at fivefold intervals, of each of the four bovine PPD tuberculins were injected intradermally into each animal and were randomly allocated to four sites on each side of the neck. All reactions were measured as increases in skinfold thickness 72 h after injection. Variations in potency were found between some of the bovine PPD tuberculins, including tuberculins produced in the same centre. The E.E.C. standard for bovine PPD with a stated potency of 50 000 Community Tuberculin Units (C.T.U.) mg-1 of PPD was the most potent tuberculin and the Weybridge, routine issue, bovine PPD with an estimated potency of 3 800 C.T.U. mg-1 PPD was the least potent tuberculin. The estimated potencies of the other tuberculins tested were as follows: the proposed international standard for bovine PPD (Rotterdam), 38 250 C.T.U. mg-1 PPD; the Belgian reference preparation for bovine PPD, 27 500 C.T.U. mg-1 PPD; Rotterdam, routine issue, bovine PPDs, 25 500 C.T.U. and 24 500 C.T.U. mg-1 PPD; United States Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.), routine issue, bovine PPD, 15 000 C.T.U. ml-1. © 1982 The International Association of Biological Standardization.",,"tuberculin; animal experiment; cattle; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; mycobacterium bovis; nonhuman; Animal; Cattle; Comparative Study; Mycobacterium bovis; Skin; Tuberculin; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis, Bovine",,"tuberculin, 92129-86-7; Tuberculin",,,,"Daniel, Janicki, Mycobacterial antigens: a review of their isolation, chemistry, and immunological properties (1978) Microbiological Review, 42, pp. 84-113; European Pharmacopoeia, (1971) Annex-Statistical analyses II, , Maisonneuve, S.

Patients were in evaluation of earliest stages of multi-modal treatment. Exercises were physician prescribed to assess use of involved body parts and to promote general activity level. Patients were instructed to do exercise repetitions until pain, weakness of fatigue caused them to stop. Patients decided when to stop. Observations of amount of exercise performed were correlated with observed visible or audible indications of pain or suffering (pain behaviors). Results indicate a consistent negative relationship, i.e., the more exercise performed, the fewer the pain behaviors.

Several schools of therapeutic acupuncture have defined different points of puncture, originally assumed to be on an empiric basis but now rationalized as areas where nerve endings congregate. Results of therapeutic acupuncture in China cannot be evaluated because of inadequate record keeping. At the University of Washington Pain Clinic, immediate results (two to three days) are good but never lasting, nor do they decrease concomitant medication. For anesthesia, acupuncture acts to produce only hypalgesia in most patients, although some experience total analgesia. Patient selection and mental preparation are careful. Hence, the method is used in much less than 10% of the operations in China, and in these the analgesia is satisfactory by Western standards in only approximately 30%. Concepts as to the mode of action of acupuncture analgesia range from an attitudinal change towards sensory input to the release of a neurohumoral analgesic substances. © 1977, American Medical Association.

Like short-wavelength germicidal UV radiation (less than 280 nm), these intermediate UV wavelengths (280-315 nm) can promote photochemical reactions in nucleic acids, leading to the appearance of such products as cyclobutadipyrimidines and single- and double-strand breaks. These photochemical reactions strongly affect the biological activities of the nucleic acids. Computer techniques are now available for predicting the chemical and biological effects of increased in vitro irradiation of purified nucleic acids. However, the effect of increased UV irradiation in vivo is complicated by the presence of sensitizing agents in cells and by the action of nucleic acid repair processes. There is strong evidence that in vivo damage to nucleic acids injures irradiated cells and tissues, but further research is needed to predict quantitatively the physiological consequences of increases in solar UV.",,"acetone; amine; bacterial DNA; coumarin derivative; DNA; ketone; mercury; ozone; purine derivative; pyrimidine derivative; Radiation Sensitizing Agents; radiosensitizing agent; RNA; silver; tryptophan; tyrosine; air pollution; DNA repair; mutation; radiation exposure; radiation response; review; sunlight; ultraviolet radiation; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Acetone; Air Pollution; Amines; Coumarins; DNA; DNA Repair; DNA, Bacterial; Ketones; Mercury; Mutation; Ozone; Purines; Pyrimidines; Radiation Effects; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; RNA; Silver; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Sunlight; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Tryptophan; Tyrosine; Ultraviolet Rays",,"acetone, 67-64-1; DNA, 9007-49-2; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; ozone, 10028-15-6; RNA, 63231-63-0; silver, 7440-22-4; tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; tyrosine, 16870-43-2, 55520-40-6, 60-18-4; Acetone, 67-64-1; Amines; Coumarins; DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, Bacterial; Ketones; Mercury, 7439-97-6; Ozone, 10028-15-6; Purines; Pyrimidines; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; RNA, 63231-63-0; Silver, 7440-22-4; Tryptophan, 73-22-3; Tyrosine, 55520-40-6",,,,,"Murphy, T.M.",,,,,,,,00113964,,,1097199,"English","Curr Top Radiat Res Q",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016516925

Forty diagnostic sera largely prepared from strains isolated from Irish calves were utilised to group the strains. Only 96 (41.1%) of the strains could be grouped with the sera, 53% being isolates from colisepticemia, 25% from intestinal contents and related structures and 21% from feces and rectal swabs. Serotype 078 K89 which was invariably associated with colisepticemia was the strain most frequently identified, being isolated in each year of the study.

Other serotypes were isolated less frequently and over 58% of the strains could not be related to any of the diagnostic sera. An attempt to establish an association between serotypes and the high incidence of white scour with post mortem manifestation of localised intestinal infection, which is very common in Irish calves, was not successful. The serotype most frequently associated with the syndrome was 09A which was isolated only on four occasions.

We found that the time course of the loss of sensitivity to a single polarity-axis-determining light stimulus coincided with the time course of germination (rhizoid outgrowth), up to the germination of about one-third the population, showing that the cells remained responsive to the light stimulus until or almost until the appearance of visible asymmetry. In the later part of the germination period, some of the zygotes may have lost their light sensitivity somewhat before rhizoid outgrowth, suggesting that at least some of the ungerminated cells may at this time possess, for a brief period, a latent but stable polarity axis. The loss of responsiveness with time to an antagonistic, second light stimulus followed the same time course as the loss of sensitivity to a single light stimulus. There was no suggestion of the existence of a latent but stable polarity axis in any members of the population in this experiment. An analysis of data of Jaffe (1968) on polarity-axis determination and germination in P. fastigiata following a single light stimulus yields essentially the same conclusions as our own single-light-stimulus experiments. In contrast, analysis of data of Whitaker and Lowrance (1936) on Fucus furcatus indicated that in these zygotes latent but stable determination of the polarity axes had taken place 3-4 hours before germination. A similar situation emerges from the analysis of another experiment of Jaffe (personal communication) with P. fastigiata zygotes in which the loss of sensitivity to an orienting light stimulus appeared accelerated and germination may have been delayed in comparison with his 1968 data. We conclude, therefore, that populations of Fucaceae zygotes may vary with regard to the existence of a latent but stable polarity axis. However, when existence of such a latent, stable polarity axis can be inferred, its duration usually is brief, and it seems to be in most cases limited to a small fraction of the individuals of the total population at any particular time. In order to infer rigorously the existence of latent but stable polarity axes in populations of germinating zygotes and similar cells, it is essential to obtain the time courses for axis stabilization and for the development of visible asymmetry simultaneously. © 1970 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,"Bentrup, F.-W.M., Vergleichende Untersuchungen zur Polaritätsinduktion durch das Licht an der Equisetum-Spore und der Fucus-Zygote (1963) Planta (Berl.), 59, pp. 472-491; Haupt, W., Die Induktion der Polarität bei der Spore von Equisetum (1957) Planta (Berl.), 49, pp. 61-90; Haupt, W., Die Entstehung der Polarität in pflanzlichen Keimzellen, insbesondere die Induktion durch Licht (1962) Ergebn.
