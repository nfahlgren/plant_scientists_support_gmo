The mechanism of action of this GTPase in fission is related to that of classical dynamin, which severs the necks of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. The scale of these membrane remodeling events differs by an order of magnitude, however, and structural studies have revealed variations in the assembly properties of classical and mitochondrial dynamins that accommodate these differences. Despite this progress, structural and mechanistic models have not yet incorporated a growing number of adaptor proteins that are required for the membrane recruitment and function of mitochondrial dynamins. Here, we review the structure and assembly properties of the yeast and mammalian mitochondrial dynamins and discuss what is known about the activities of their adaptor proteins. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"clathrin; dynamin; guanosine triphosphate; mitochondrial protein; signal transducing adaptor protein; animal; biosynthesis; coated pit; metabolism; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrion; review; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Clathrin; Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane; Dynamins; Guanosine Triphosphate; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondrial Membranes; Mitochondrial Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"dynamin; guanosine triphosphate, 86-01-1",,,"GM53466, NIH, National Institutes of Health; GM84970, NIH, National Institutes of Health","Nunnari, J., Marshall, W.F., Straight, A., Murray, A., Sedat, J.W., Walter, P., Mitochondrial transmission during mating in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is determined by mitochondrial fusion and fission and the intramitochondrial segregation of mitochondrial DNA (1997) Mol.

Additional membrane-associated adaptor proteins (Fis1, Mdv1, Mff, and MiDs) are required to recruit these GTPases from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial surface. Whether these adaptors participate in both GTPase recruitment and membrane scission is not known. Here we use a yeast strain lacking all fission proteins to identify the minimal combinations of GTPases and adaptors sufficient for mitochondrial fission. Although Fis1 is dispensable for fission, membrane-anchored Mdv1, Mff, or MiDs paired individually with their respective GTPases are sufficient to divide mitochondria. In addition to their role in Drp1 membrane recruitment, MiDs coassemble with Drp1 in vitro. The resulting het-eropolymer adopts a dramatically different structure with a narrower diameter than Drp1 homopolymers assembled in isolation. This result demonstrates that an adaptor protein alters the architecture of a mitochondrial dynamin GTPase polymer in a manner that could facilitate membrane constriction and severing activity.","Drp1/dnm1; Fis1/mdv1; Mff/MiD49/MiD51; Mitochondrial fission dynamin","adaptor protein; drp1 protein; dynamin; Fis1 protein; guanosine triphosphatase; Mdv1 protein; membrane protein; Mff protein; MiD protein; unclassified drug; article; catalysis; cellular parameters; controlled study; fungal strain; human; hydrolysis; mitochondrial membrane scission; priority journal; protein assembly; protein structure; Cell Division; Dynamin I; Dynamins; Green Fluorescent Proteins; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Guanosine Triphosphate; Humans; Hydrolysis; Membrane Proteins; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Degradation; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondrial Proteins; Polymers; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,"guanosine triphosphatase, 9059-32-9; Dynamin I, 3.5.1.50; Dynamins, 3.6.5.5; Fis1p protein, S cerevisiae; GTP Phosphohydrolases, 3.6.1.-; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Guanosine Triphosphate, 86-01-1; Membrane Proteins; Mff protein, human; Mitochondrial Proteins; Polymers; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,,,"Praefcke, G.J., McMahon, H.T., The dynamin superfamily: Universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?

The structural features underlying this interaction are poorly understood. Using yeast as a model, we show that the Insert B domain of the Dnm1 guanosine triphosphatase (a DRP) contains a novel motif required for association with the mitochondrial adaptor Mdv1. Mutation of this conserved motif specifically disrupted Dnm1-Mdv1 interactions, blocking Dnm1 recruitment and mitochondrial fission. Suppressor mutations in Mdv1 that restored Dnm1-Mdv1 interactions and fission identified potential protein-binding interfaces on the Mdv1 β-propeller domain. These results define the first known function for Insert B in DRP-adaptor interactions. Based on the variability of Insert B sequences and adaptor proteins, we propose that Insert B domains and mitochondrial adaptors have coevolved to meet the unique requirements for mitochondrial fission of different organisms. © 2012 Bui et al.",,"dynamin I; guanosine triphosphatase; Mdv1 protein; protein; unclassified drug; allele; article; fluorescence microscopy; gene mutation; in vivo study; mitochondrion; nonhuman; outer membrane; priority journal; protein binding; protein interaction; protein motif; yeast; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Mitochondrial Membranes; Mitochondrial Proteins; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Sequence Alignment",,"guanosine triphosphatase, 9059-32-9; protein, 67254-75-5; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; DNM1 protein, S cerevisiae, 3.6.5.5; GTP Phosphohydrolases, 3.6.1.-; MDV1 protein, S cerevisiae; Mitochondrial Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,,,"Arimura, S., Fujimoto, M., Doniwa, Y., Kadoya, N., Nakazono, M., Sakamoto, W., Tsutsumi, N., Arabidopsis ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 is required for localization of DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A to mitochondrial fission sites (2008) Plant Cell., 20, pp. 1555-1566. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.058578; Bhar, D., Karren, M.A., Babst, M., Shaw, J.M., Dimeric Dnm1-G385D interacts with Mdv1 on mitochondria and can be stimulated to assemble into fission complexes containing Mdv1 and Fis1 (2006) J.

We aim to study whether the results from seismic inversion of subsalt data are sufficiently robust for reliable reservoir characterization. Approximately 481.25 mi2 of poststack, wide-azimuth, anisotropic (vertical transverse isotropic) wave-equation migration seismic data from 50 Outer Continental Shelf blocks in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico were inverted in this study. A total of four subsalt wells and four subsalt seismic interpreted horizons were used in the inversion process, and one of the wells was used for a blind test. Our poststack inversion method used an iterative discrete spike inversion method, based on the combination of space-adaptive wavelet processing to invert for relative acoustic impedance. Next, the dips were estimated from seismic data and converted to a horizon-like layer sequence field that was used as one of the inputs into the low-frequency model. The background model was generated by incorporating the well velocities, seismic velocity, seismic interpreted horizons, and the previously derived layer sequence field in the low-frequency model. Then, the relative acoustic impedance volume was scaled by adding the low-frequency model to match the calculated acoustic impedance logs from the wells for absolute acoustic impedance. Finally, the geological information and rock physics data were incorporated into the reservoir properties assessment for sand/shale prediction in two main target reservoirs in the Miocene and Wilcox formations. Overall, the poststack inversion results and the sand/shale prediction showed good ties at the well locations. This was clearly demonstrated in the blind test well. Hence, incorporating rock physics and geology enables poststack inversion in subsalt areas. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","Deep water; Inversion; Rock physics; Salt dome; Wells","Background model; Blind test; Continental shelves; Deep Water; Geological information; Gulf of Mexico; High resolution; Inversion; Inversion methods; Inversion process; Inversion results; Layer sequence; Low frequency; Miocene; Reservoir characterization; Reservoir property; Rock physics; Salt dome; Seismic datas; Seismic inversion; Seismic velocities; Transverse isotropic; Wave-equation migration; Wavelet processing; Well location; Acoustic impedance; Geology; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Wells; Rocks; acoustic imagery; azimuth; data inversion; image resolution; salt dome; seismic anisotropy; seismic data; seismic velocity; wave equation; wavelet analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Green Canyon; Gulf of Mexico",,,,,,"Bui, H., Ng, D., Becker, D., Zhou, Z., Smith, M., (2010), 29, pp. 302-306. , Well-to-seismic mistie: A valuable indicator of seismic anisotropy for subsalt velocity model update.

The most important thing is how to indicate and estimate anisotropy for anisotropic velocity model building. In a previous work, we presented the valuable indicator of anisotropy based on well-seismic misties Bui et al., 2010. In this paper, we introduce the concepts and a method to estimate anisotropy by incorporating well, rock physics, and geological information. It is very well-known that anisotropic parameters are poorly resolved by seismic data alone. Incorporation of the well and geological information, such as check shot, calibrated sonic, and geological markers will help to improve seismic resolution. Our prime goal is to understand the effect of geological constraints on anisotropy as well as anisotropic seismic velocity in each study area. To do this, we must determine geological constraints by mapping geobodies/seismic horizons from seismic interpretation with the set of well logs. The goal of modern imaging is to tie seismic events with well markers to accurately position hydrocarbon reservoirs based on the indicator from seismic-to-well tie. We use a 1D ray-tracing model for building an anisotropic model from seismic data with well control. The concepts are to match the seismic events with the well markers as well as flatten common-image-point CIP gathers. We also incorporate the rock physics information with the 1 seismic velocity correction at well location, and 2 constrain the anisotropy estimation for each seismic sequence. Then, the 1D anisotropic function at the well location is upscaled into 3D by using local well tomography before they are propagated into the whole area of interest. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","3D; Anisotropy; Case history; Depth migration; TTI",,,,,,,"Bakulin, A., Woodward, M., Nichols, D., Osypov, K., Zdraveva, O., Localized anisotropic tomography with well information in VTI media: 79th Annual International Meeting (2009) SEG, Expanded Abstracts, 28, pp. 221-225. , dfoSEGEAB1052-3812SEG Exp.

The yeast Mdv1 adaptor localizes to mitochondria by binding to the membrane protein Fis1. Subsequent Mdv1 binding to the mitochondrial dynamin Dnm1 stimulates Dnm1 assembly into spirals, which encircle and divide the mitochondrial compartment. In this study, we report that dimeric Mdv1 is joined at its center by a 92-Å antiparallel coiled coil (CC). Modeling of the Fis1 - Mdv1 complex using available crystal structures suggests that the Mdv1 CC lies parallel to the bilayer with N termini at opposite ends bound to Fis1 and C-terminal β-propeller domains (Dnm1-binding sites) extending into the cytoplasm. A CC length of appropriate length and sequence is necessary for optimal Mdv1 interaction with Fis1 and Dnm1 and is important for proper Dnm1 assembly before membrane scission. Our results provide a framework for understanding how adaptors act as scaffolds to orient and stabilize the assembly of dynamins on membranes. © 2010 Koirala et al.",,"dimer; dynamin; factor for inversion stimulation; mitochondrial protein; protein; protein fis 1; protein mdv 1; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; article; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; crystal structure; cytoplasm; nonhuman; priority journal; protein assembly; protein domain; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein structure; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Binding Sites; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Proteins; Models, Molecular; Protein Conformation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,"protein, 67254-75-5; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; DNM1 protein, S cerevisiae, 3.6.5.5; Fis1p protein, S cerevisiae; GTP Phosphohydrolases, 3.6.1.-; MDV1 protein, S cerevisiae; Mitochondrial Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,,,"Amiott, E.A., Cohen, M.M., Saint-Georges, Y., Weissman, A.M., Shaw, J.M., A mutation associated with CMT2A neuropathy causes defects in Fzo1 GTP hydrolysis, ubiquitylation, and protein turnover (2009) Mol.

Recently, the final product from seismic data processing is delivered in the depth. However, well depth and seismic depth can be different, so there are unique issues that must be addressed to bring the two results together. Migration velocity is the one of the most important variables affecting the well-to-seismic tie, because incorrect velocities result in lateral and vertical mispositioning of reflections. One factor that can significantly affect the velocities is the presence of anisotropy. Incorrectly accounting for anisotropy manifests itself as an incorrect vertical seismic velocity, causing the data to mistie. The seismic-well tie is conducted in time, and then converted back to depth. However, this process can introduce additional uncertainty from the fact that the velocities used to transform each dataset to depth can be different. In this paper, we address how to identify seismic anisotropy to match those data, hence, using that information to re-image the seismic data. Rock-physics modelling can be incorporated into the well-seismic tie process to assist anisotropy estimation. We show examples of how to use mis-tie and rock-property analysis to account for anisotropy. © 2010, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.",,"Anisotropy; Engineering exhibitions; Engineers; Petroleum engineering; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Velocity; Anisotropy estimation; Data sets; Deep-water area; Gulf of Mexico; Migration velocity; One-factor; Physics modelling; Seismic anisotropy; Seismic data processing; Seismic datas; Seismic velocities; Synthetic seismogram; Well data; Well depth; Data processing",,,,,,"Akaike, H., Fitting autoregressive models for prediction (1969) Ann.

It was formed by the Red River Fault displacement and South China Sea opening, and can be divided into three main parts due to stratigraphic distribution: onshore, northern offshore area and southern offshore area. This basin is considered to have a high potential for hydrocarbons, but only some gas fields have been found to date. In this study, we reinterpreted two-dimensional seismic data from the north Song Hong Basin to build structural maps of the study area. Reconstruction of the tectonic evolution of some typical sections illustrates the structural configuration and especially development of the fault system in the area. The newest results of re-interpretation reveal many flower structures and evidence for the right lateral displacement on the Red River fault after 5.5 Ma, unreported in previous works. This can be used to explain the complex structure of Song Hong Basin and suggests the reason why exploration for hydrocarbon traps is very difficult. © Geol. Soc.

The Cuulong Basin experienced the tectonic activities caused by the South China Sea spreading. Block 15-2 in the Cuulong basin south of Vietnam is a well-known area with some oil fields comprising high-yield zones located in a fractured granite basement. The Vung Dong prospect in this block includes a basement high with extensive faulting. This present work is on the seismic interpretation of the 3-D seismics in an area of 6 × 12.5 km2. From interpretation of three-dimensional seismic data for this prospect, two major fault systems are identified; an older fault system of Eocene-Oligocene in age affecting basement, and a younger fault system active during the Miocene time, that is correlated with the opening of the South China Sea. Activation of the younger faults in this area resulted in basement uplift and truncation of Oligocene sediments at the basement high, where younger Miocene sediments directly overlie the basement. A 3D structure model is constructed for this prospect based on this seismic interpretation, providing an overview of the structure and tectonics to aid the assessment of oil and gas accumulation potential of the region. © Geol.

They are formed in resulting from fluid venting through the seabed or by the expulsion of gas or water from the sediment, typically in areas of rapid and extensive sedimentation, causing abnormal fluid pressure that drives overthrust faults. Subsurface fluid flow is important natural process that has an effect on all physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of sedimentary rocks that may be hazards or benefits for human life as well as oil and gas exploration and production. However, dynamic and driving mechanism of this geological process still remains unknown. In this study, we use the distinct element method (DEM), which solves mass and momentum equations for fluid velocities and pressures based on Navier-Stokes equation for a fluid interacting with a solid phase to simulate fluid-particle flow in heterogeneous media. As a result, we produce realistic 2-dimensional geologic configurations from DEM simulation that can be matched either with some observed natural features or in seismic data, such as: mud volcanoes or pockmarks. We conclude that DEM method is applicable and appropriate for describing natural phenomena. This method, therefore, should be widely applied to simulate various nature scenarios. © 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,,,,,,,"(2006) Augustine Description and Statistics, , http://www.avo.alaska.edu/, Alaska Volcanoes Observatory; Cundall, P.A., Strack, O.D.L., A discrete numerical model for granular assemblies (1979) Géotechnique, 29, pp. 47-65; Hovland, M., Judd, A., Seabed pockmarks and seepages: Impact on geology, biology and the marine environment (1988) Graham and Trotman; Hovland, M., Svensen, H., Forsberg, C.F., Johansen, H., Fichler, C., Fossa, J.H., Jonsson, R., Rueslatten, H., Complex pockmarks with carbonate-ridges off mid-Norway: Products of sediment degassing (2005) Marine Geology, 218, pp. 191-206; Huyen, B.T.T., Yamada, Y., Matsuoka, T., Nur, A., Application of distinct element method into simulation of the Red River fault displacements (2006) Proceedings of the 8th Annual Conference and Exhibition, SEGJ 564-569, , Extended Abstracts; Moore, C.J., Fluid seeps at continental margins: A report of a workshop defining critical research issues affecting geology, biology, the oceans and the atmosphere (2001), National Science Foundation/Margins Workshop, University of California at Santa CruzSilvestru, E., Bubbles of surprise (2001) Journal of Creation, 15, pp. 89-93; Sotto, M., Boulliard, J.C., Thermally induced transitions on clean stepped gold surfaces through LEED (1989) Surface Science, 214, pp. 97-110; Theory and Background (2006) PFC 2D, Version 3.1, , HCItasca; Tryon, M.D., Brown, K.M., Complex flow patterns through Hydrate Ridge and their impact on seep biota (2001) Geophysical Research Letters, 28, pp. 2863-2866; Tsuji, Y., Kawaguchi, T., Tanaka, T., Discrete particle simulation of two dimensional fluidized bed (1993) Powder Technology, 77, p. 79; Tsuji, Y., Tanaka, T., Ishida, T., Lagrangian numerical simulation of plug flow of cohesionless particles in a horizontal pipe (1992) Powder Technology, 71, p. 239; Yamada, Y., Matsuoka, T., Digital sandbox modeling using discrete element method (DEM): Applications to fault tectonics (2004) Faults and Petroleum Traps: American Association of Petroleum Geologists Memoir, , in R.
