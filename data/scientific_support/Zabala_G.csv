In plants, knowledge of the biogenesis and mechanisms of action of smRNA classes including microRNAs (miRNAs), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) has been gained mostly through studies with Arabidopsis. In recent years, high throughput sequencing of smRNA populations has enabled extension of knowledge from model systems to plants with larger, more complex genomes. Soybean (Glycine max) now has many genomics resources available including a complete genome sequence and predicted gene models. Relatively little is known, however, about the full complement of its endogenous smRNAs populations and the silenced genes.Results: Using Illumina sequencing and computational analysis, we characterized eight smRNA populations from multiple tissues and organs of soybean including developing seed and vegetative tissues. A total of 41 million raw sequence reads collapsed into 135,055 unique reads were mapped to the soybean genome and its predicted cDNA gene models. Bioinformatic analyses were used to distinguish miRNAs and siRNAs and to determine their genomic origins and potential target genes. In addition, we identified two soybean TAS3 gene homologs, the miRNAs that putatively guide cleavage of their transcripts, and the derived tasiRNAs that could target soybean genes annotated as auxin response factors. Tissue-differential expression based on the flux of normalized miRNA and siRNA abundances in the eight smRNA libraries was evident, some of which was confirmed by smRNA blotting. Our global view of these smRNA populations also revealed that the size classes of smRNAs varied amongst different tissues, with the developing seed and seed coat having greater numbers of unique smRNAs of the 24-nt class compared to the vegetative tissues of germinating seedlings. The 24-nt class is known to be derived from repetitive elements including transposons. Detailed analysis of the size classes associated with ribosomal RNAs and transposable element families showed greater diversity of smRNAs in the 22- and 24-nt size classes.Conclusions: The flux of endogenous smRNAs within multiple stages and tissues of seed development was contrasted with vegetative tissues of soybean, one of the dominant sources of protein and oil in world markets. The smRNAs varied in size class, complexity of origins, and possible targets. Sequencing revealed tissue-preferential expression for certain smRNAs and expression differences among closely related miRNA family members. © 2012 Zabala et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Arabidopsis;

The recent explosion of research on gene silencing mediated by small RNAs has shown that they are essential for plants to mount defense responses against invading viruses and abiotic stress, to prevent transposons from jumping, to regulate diverse developmental processes, and even to modulate their own biogenesis. The current and future research is focused on determining the extent to which Short Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are likely to influence tissue and organ-specific gene expression in soybean by providing estimates of the number of unique small RNAs in selected tissue and organ systems and mapping those to ESTs and to the recently completed soybean genome. The data would also provide a valuable resource for targeting physiological processes that may be regulated in this manner in this important plant species. © 2012 AOCS Press Published by Elsevier Inc.

We describe here the intricacies of this naturally occurring silencing mechanism based on results from small RNA gel blots and high-throughput sequencing of small RNA populations. The two dominant alleles of the / locus encompass a 27-kb region containing two perfectly repeated and inverted clusters of three chalcone synthase genes (CHS1, CHS3, and CHS4). This structure silences the expression of all CHS genes, including CHS7 and CHS8, located on other chromosomes. The CHS short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) sequenced support a mechanism by which RNAs transcribed from the CHS inverted repeat form aberrant double-stranded RNAs that become substrates for dicer-like ribonuclease. The resulting primary siRNAs become guides that target the mRNAs of the nonlinked, highly expressed CHS7 and CHS8 genes, followed by subsequent amplification of CHS7 and CHS8 secondary siRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Most remarkably, this silencing mechanism occurs only in one tissue, the seed coat, as shown by the lack of CHS siRNAs in cotyledons and vegetative tissues. Thus, production of the trigger double-stranded RNA that initiates the process occurs in a specific tissue and represents an example of naturally occurring inhibition of a metabolic pathway by siRNAs in one tissue while allowing expression of the pathway and synthesis of valuable secondary metabolites in all other organs/tissues of the plant. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"acyltransferase; chalcone synthase; small interfering RNA; vegetable protein; article; enzymology; genetics; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; physiology; plant seed; signal transduction; soybean; Acyltransferases; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering; Seeds; Signal Transduction; Soybeans; Glycine max","GENBANK: EF623854, EF623856, EF623857, EF623858, EF623859, X15199, X65636","acyltransferase, 9012-30-0, 9054-54-0; chalcone synthase, 56803-04-4; Acyltransferases, 2.3.-; Plant Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering; flavanone synthetase, 2.3.1.74",,,,"Allen, E., Xie, Z., Gustafson, A.M., Sung, G.-H., Spatafora, J.W., Carrington, J.C., Evolution of microRNA genes by inverted duplication of target gene sequences in arabidopsis thaliana (2004) Nat.

The molecular organization of very few genetically defined CACTA transposon systems have been characterized thoroughly as those of Spm/En in maize, Tam1 of Antirrhinum majus Candystripe1 (Cs1) from Sorghum bicolor and CAC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, for example. To date, only defective deletion derivatives of CACTA elements have been described for soybean, an economically important plant species whose genome sequence will be completed in 2008. Results. We identified a 20.5 kb insertion in a soybean flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) gene representing the t* allele (stable gray trichome color) whose origin traces to a single mutable chimeric plant displaying both tawny and gray trichomes. This 20.5 kb insertion has the molecular structure of a putative autonomous transposon of the CACTA family, designated Tgmt*. It encodes a large gene that was expressed in two sister isolines (T* and t m) of the stable gray line (t*) from which Tgmt* was isolated. RT-PCR derived cDNAs uncovered the structure of a large precursor mRNA as well as alternatively spliced transcripts reminiscent of the TNPA-mRNA generated by the En-1 element of maize but without sequence similarity to the maize TNPA. The larger mRNA encodes a transposase with a tnp2 and TNP1-transposase family domains. Because the two soybean lines expressing Tgmt* were derived from the same mutable chimeric plant that created the stable gray trichome t* allele line from which the element was isolated, Tgmt* has the potential to be an autonomous element that was rapidly inactivated in the stable gray trichome t* line. Comparison of Tgmt* to previously described Tgm elements demonstrated that two subtypes of CACTA transposon families exist in soybean based on divergence of their characteristic subterminal repeated motifs and their transposases. In addition, we report the sequence and annotation of a BAC clone containing the F3'H gene (T locus) which was interrupted by the novel Tgmt* element in the gray trichome allele t*. Conclusion. The molecular characterization of a 20.5 kb insertion in the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) gene of a soybean gray pubescence allele (t*) identified the structure of a CACTA transposon designated Tgmt*. Besides the terminal inverted repeats and subterminal repeated motifs,Tgmt* encoded a large gene with two putative functions that are required for excision and transposition of a CACTA element, a transposase and the DNA binding protein known to associate to the subterminal repeated motifs. The degree of dissimilarity between Tgmt* transposase and subterminal repeated motifs with those of previously characterized defective CACTA elements (Tgm1-7) were evidence of the existence of two subfamilies of CACTA transposons in soybean, an observation not previously reported in other plants. In addition, our analyses of a genetically active and potentially autonomous element sheds light on the complete structure of a soybean element that is useful for annotation of the repetitive fraction of the soybean genome sequence and may prove useful for transposon tagging or transposon display experiments in different genetic lines. © 2008 Zabala and Vodkin;

Not much is known with regard to the mechanisms of gene fragment capture by those transposon elements or the expression of the captured host gene fragments. There is some evidence that chimeric transcripts can be assembled and exist in EST collections. Results: We report results obtained from analysis of RT-PCR derived cDNAs of the Glycine max mutant flower color gene, wp, that contains a 5.7-kb transposon (Tgm-Express1) in Intron 2 of the flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene (F3H) and is composed of five unrelated host gene fragments. The collection of cDNAs derived from the wp allele represents a multiplicity of processed RNAs varying in length and sequence that includes some identical to the correctly processed mature F3H transcript with three properly spliced exons. Surprisingly, the five gene fragments carried by the Tgm-Express1 were processed through complex alternative splicing as additional exons of the wp transcript. Conclusion: The gene fragments carried by the Tgm inverted repeat ends appear to be retained as functional exons/introns within the element. The spliceosomes then select indiscriminately the canonical intron splice sites from a pre-mRNA to assemble diverse chimeric transcripts from the exons contained in the wp allele. The multiplicity and randomness of these events provide some insights into the origin and mechanism of alternatively spliced genes.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Glycine max; Oryza sativa; Zea mays;

Merr.] flower pigmentation is controlled by six loci, W1, W2, W3, W4, Wm, and Wp, of which the functions of only three are known. None of the recessive alleles at those three loci completely abolishes flower pigmentation. On the other hand, the W1 locus is required for flower pigmentotion. Based on genetic and biochemical data, the trihydroxylation reaction to form delphinidin-3-glucoside has been postulated as a likely function of the W1 locus. We report the cloning and sequencing of a flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H) gene from the purple flower soybean line L79-908 (W1) and the recessive allele from the white flower isoline 'Williams' (w1). The mutation is a rearrangement leading to a small (65 bp) insertion of tandem repeats in exon 3 that truncates the translation product prematurely. The presence of this insertion in all-white flower soybean lines examined and in those of a segregating population resulting from a cross between purple and white flower lines presents compelling evidence that the F3′5′H gene isolated is likely encoded by the W1 locus of Glycine max. GmF3′5′H is a single-copy gene, expressed at very low levels in all tissues examined, including flower and seed coats, but sufficient to account for the contribution of the delphinidin-based anthocyanins and/or proanthocyanins in these tissues. © Crop Science Society of America.",,"Glycine max",,,,,,"Brugliera, F., Barri-Rewell, G., Holton, T.A., Mason, J.G., Isolation and characterization of a flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase cDNA clone corresponding to the Ht1 locus of Petunia hybrida (1999) Plant J, 19, pp. 441-451; Buzzell, R.I., Buttery, B.R., MacTavish, D.C., Biochemical genetics of black pigmentation of soybean seed (1987) J.

The majority of those findings were derived from single gene studies and more recently from several global gene expression analyses. We undertook a global transcriptional analysis focused on the response of genes of the multiple branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway to infection by the Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea with or without the avirulence gene avrB to characterize more broadly the contribution of the multiple branches of the pathway to the resistance response in soybean. Transcript abundance in leaves was determined from analysis of soybean cDNA microarray data and hybridizations to RNA blots with specific gene probes. Results: The majority of the genes surveyed presented patterns of increased transcript accumulation. Some increased rapidly, 2 and 4 hours after inoculation, while others started to accumulate slowly by 8 - 12 hours. In contrast, transcripts of a few genes decreased in abundance 2 hours post inoculation. Most interestingly was the opposite temporal fluctuation in transcript abundance between early responsive genes in defense (CHS and IFS1) and F3H, the gene encoding a pivotal enzyme in the synthesis of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and flavonols. F3H transcripts decreased rapidly 2 hours post inoculation and increased during periods when CHS and IFS transcripts decreased. It was also determined that all but one (CHS4) family member genes (CHS1, CHS2, CHS3, CHS5, CHS6 and CHS7/8) accumulated higher transcript levels during the defense response provoked by the avirulent pathogen challenge. Conclusion: Based on the mRNA profiles, these results show the strong bias that soybean has towards increasing the synthesis of isoflavonoid phytoalexins concomitant with the down regulation of genes required for the synthesis of anthocyanins and proanthocyanins. Although proanthocyanins are known to be toxic compounds, the cells in the soybean leaves seem to be programmed to prioritize the synthesis and accumulation of isoflavonoid and pterocarpan phytoalexins during the resistance response. It was known that CHS transcripts accumulate in great abundance rapidly after inoculation of the soybean plants but our results have demonstrated that all but one (CHS4) member of the gene family member genes accumulated higher transcript levels during the defense response. © 2006 Zabala et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Glycine max; Pseudomonas syringae; Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea; AvrB protein, Pseudomonas syringae; bacterial protein; flavonoid; lignin; messenger RNA; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; plant gene; plant leaf; Pseudomonas syringae; soybean; Bacterial Proteins; Flavonoids; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Lignin; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Pseudomonas syringae; RNA, Messenger; Soybeans",,"lignin, 9005-53-2; AvrB protein, Pseudomonas syringae; Bacterial Proteins; Flavonoids; Lignin; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Cross, J.E., Kennedy, B.W., Lambert, J.W., Cooper, R.L., Pathogenic races of the bacterial pathogen of soybeans, Pseudomonas glycinea (1966) Plant Disease Report, 50, pp. 557-560; Klement, Z., From hypersensitivity defense reaction of plants to pathogens (1982) Phytopathogenic Prokariotes, pp. 149-177. , Edited by: Mount MS, Lacy GH.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and RNA gel blots of purple and pink flower isolines, as well as the presence of a 5.7-kb transposon insertion in the wp mutant allele, have unequivocally shown that flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene 1 is the Wp locus. Moreover, the 5.7-kb insertion in wp represents a novel transposable element (termed Tgm-Express1) with inverted repeats closely related to those of other Tgms (transposable-like elements, G. max) but distinct in several characteristics, including the lack of subterminal inverted repeats. More significantly, Tgm-Express1 contains four truncated cellular genes from the soybean genome, resembling the Pack-MULEs (Mutator-like transposable elements) found in maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and Arabidopsis thaliana and the Helitrons of maize. The presence of the Tgm-Express1 element causing the wp mutation, as well as a second Tgm-Express2 element elsewhere in the soybean genome, extends the ability to acquire and transport host DNA segments to the CACTA family of elements, which includes both Tgm and the prototypical maize Spm/En. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Arrays; Crops; DNA; Arabidopsis; Cellular genes; Mutant; Soybean genome; Genetic engineering; Genetic Engineering; Nucleic Acids; Soy Beans; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Glycine max; Oryza sativa; Zea mays; complementary DNA; flavanone 3 dioxygenase; flavanone 3-dioxygenase; mixed function oxidase; article; DNA microarray; enzymology; flower; gene; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome; molecular genetics; mutation; phenotype; pigmentation; sequence homology; soybean; transposon; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Complementary; Flowers; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genome, Plant; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phenotype; Pigmentation; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Soybeans","GENBANK: AF198451, AI900038, AW277481, AW704002, AY669324, AY669325, AY669326, AY994154, BM307914, BM521027, BM731251, BQ253507, CF922959, M93140, U64200, AY669324, AY669325, AY669326, AY994154","mixed function oxidase, 9040-60-2; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Complementary; flavanone 3-dioxygenase, EC 1.14.11.9; Mixed Function Oxygenases, EC 1.-",,,,"Bernard, R.L., Weiss, M.G., Quantitative genetics (1973) Soybeans: Improvement, Production and Uses, pp. 117-154. , B.E.

Twelve Arabidopsis proteins that physically interact with RPS2 in yeast were identified. Four of these were studied further including a calmodulin, a putative ankyrin/tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, a protein with a nuclear localization domain, and a protein of unknown function. In yeast, all four interacted with RPS2 and not with a related resistance protein, RPM1. Three of the four interacted solely with N-terminal domains of RPS2 and not with the RPS2 LRR domain. Interactions were not impacted by RPS2 nucleotide binding site mutations. When disease resistance was tested in Arabidopsis, plant lines carrying T-DNA insertions that disrupt the genes for the ankyrin/tetratricopeptide repeat protein or the protein of unknown function exhibited reduced resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 expressing avrRpt2. The RPS2 interacting proteins identified in this screen are new targets for studies of plant defense signal transduction. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the most economically valuable crop species in the world food supply. In order to accelerate both gene discovery as well as hypothesis-driven research in soybean, global expression resources needed to be developed. The applications of microarray for determining patterns of expression in different tissues or during conditional treatments by dual labeling of the mRNAs are unlimited. In addition, discovery of the molecular basis of traits through examination of naturally occurring variation in hundreds of mutant lines could be enhanced by the construction and use of soybean cDNA microarrays. Results: We report the construction and analysis of a low redundancy 'unigene' set of 27,513 clones that represent a variety of soybean cDNA libraries made from a wide array of source tissue and organ systems, developmental stages, and stress or pathogen-challenged plants. The set was assembled from the 5′ sequence data of the cDNA clones using cluster analysis programs. The selected clones were then physically reracked and sequenced at the 3′ end. In order to increase gene discovery from immature cotyledon libraries that contain abundant mRNAs representing storage protein gene families, we utilized a high density filter normalization approach to preferentially select more weakly expressed cDNAs. All 27,513 cDNA inserts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified products, along with some repetitively spotted control or 'choice' clones, were used to produce three 9,728-element microarrays that have been used to examine tissue specific gene expression and global expression in mutant isolines. Conclusions: Global expression studies will be greatly aided by the availability of the sequence-validated and low redundancy cDNA sets described in this report. These cDNAs and ESTs represent a wide array of developmental stages and physiological conditions of the soybean plant. We also demonstrate that the quality of the data from the soybean cDNA microarrays is sufficiently reliable to examine isogenic lines that differ with respect to a mutant phenotype and thereby to define a small list of candidate genes potentially encoding or modulated by the mutant phenotype. © 2004 Vodkin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"complementary DNA; messenger RNA; complementary DNA; plant DNA; 3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; article; cluster analysis; controlled study; cotyledon; density; developmental stage; DNA library; DNA microarray; DNA sequence; expressed sequence tag; filter; gene amplification; gene construct; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic trait; genetic variability; hypothesis; medical research; modulation; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; near isogenic line; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; plant development; plant pathogen interaction; polymerase chain reaction; reliability; soybean; tissue specificity; validation process; antibody specificity; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene library; genetics; methodology; mutation; physiology; soybean; statistics; Glycine max; Cluster Analysis; Cotyledon; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Library; Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Organ Specificity; Phenotype; Soybeans","GENBANK: AF207687, AF499730, AF499731, AI442436, AI442449, AI495218, AI900038, AI930858, AW185639, AW309104, AW318233, AW348131, BE657237, BE818850, BE823467, BE823540, BE824331, BE824364, BE824378, BU544257, BU544616, BU545435, BU546067, BU546179, BU546503, BU546899, BU547254, BU547484, BU547671, BU547781, BU547784, BU547794, BU547868, BU547869, BU547961, BU547986, BU548940, BU548943, BU549206, BU549267, BU550097, BU550458, BU550525, BU550654, BU551008, J05208","DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant",,,,"Velculescu, V.E., Ahang, L., Vogelstein, B., Kinzler, K.W., Serial analysis of gene expression (1995) Science, 270, pp. 484-487; Schena, M.D., Shalon, D., Heller, R., Chai, A., Brown, P.O., Davis, R.W., Parallel human genome analysis: Microarray-based expression monitoring of 1000 genes (1996) Proc.

This region was found to be rearranged in the mitochondria of all cms-S cytoplasmically revertant fertile plants in all nuclear backgrounds analyzed. A 1.6-kb mRNA transcribed from the R region in mitochondria of sterile plants was absent from all cytoplasmic revertants examined. The nuclear gene Rf3, which suppresses the cms-S phenotype, was found to have a specific effect on the expression of the R sequence; the abundance of the major R transcripts, including the cms-S-specific 1.6-kb mRNA, is decreased in mitochondria of restored plants. Nucleotide sequence analysis of R has revealed similarities to the R1 plasmid found in some South American maize races with RU cytoplasm, to the M1 plasmid found in one source of Zea luxurians teosinte, to the atp9 mitochondrial gene and its 3' flanking sequence, and also to a region 3' to the orf221 gene. The derived amino acid sequence of the R region predicts two open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs contain the similarities to R1, M1, atp9 and orf221. The present report reveals the chimeric nature of the R region, describes the complex effect of Rf3 on the expression of the R sequence and implicates R in the sterile phenotype of cms-S maize.",,"article; chimera; crop; gene expression; gene sequence; maize; male; male sterility; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Chimera; Cytoplasm; DNA, Mitochondrial; Fertility; Gene Rearrangement; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Nuclear Proteins; Open Reading Frames; Plant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Transcription, Genetic; Zea mays; Zea luxurians; Zea mays",,"DNA, Mitochondrial; Nuclear Proteins; Plant Proteins",,,,"Abad, A.R., Mehrtens, B.J., Mackenzie, S.A., Specific expression in reproductive tissues and fate of a mitochondrial sterility-associated protein in cytoplasmic male-sterile bean (1995) Plant Cell, 7, pp. 271-285; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

The protein appears identical to that synthesized by the closely related S2 episome found in cytoplasmic male sterile maize of the S type. Protein was detected using antisera raised against a β-galactosidase: ORF1 fusion product containing the most antigenic region of the ORF1 product. Detection of this protein is in contrast to previous reports that mitochondria of normal, male-fertile lines either do not contain this protein, or that there are 11 in-frame stop codons in the reading frame. The integrated R2 of B37N was cloned and this region sequenced, confirming that a continuous open reading frame existed.

S1 contains three long open reading frames URF2 (1017 bp), URF3 (2782 bp) and URF4 (768 bp). We have demonstrated that the URF3 sequence of S1 encodes a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 103 kDa which is found in cms-S but undetectable in cms-T, cms-C or normal (fertile) mitochondria. A translational fusion containing the 5′ terminus of the lacZ gene and 800 bp of the 3′ end of URF3 was isolated from a cms-S mitochondrial genomic library in the expression vector λgt11. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the resulting fusion protein immunoprecipitated a 103 kDa polypeptide from among [35S]-methionine-labeled cms-S mitochondrial proteins but not from normal mitochondrial proteins. The mitochondria of fertile F1 plants resulting from a cross between B37 cms-S and Ky21 (universal restorer) contain as much of this 103 kDa protein as is observed in sterile cms-S mitochondria. The mitochondria of fertile cytoplasmic revertants from cms-RD and cms-LM in a WF9 nuclear background also synthesized the 103 kDa protein. We conclude that the URF3 sequence of the S1 episome is expressed in vivo and that the presence of its gene product in maize mitochondria is not sufficient to confer the male sterile phenotype. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","λg11 vector; Cytoplasmic male sterility; Hybrid protein expression; Nuclear mitochondrial interaction; Restoration of fertility",,,,,,,"Aiba, H., Adhya, S., de Crombrugghe, B., Evidence for two functional gal promoters in intact Escherichia coli cells (1981) J Biol Chem, 256, pp. 11905-11910; Beckett, J.B., Classification of male sterile cytoplasms in maize (Zea mays L) (1971) Crop Sci, 11, pp. 724-727; Borck, K.S., Walbot, V., Comparison of the restriction endonuclease patterns of mitochondrial DNA from normal and malesterile cytoplasms of Zea mays L (1982) Genetics, 102, pp. 109-128; Bruck, C., Portetelle, D., Glineur, C., Bollen, A., One-step purification of mouse monoclonal antibodies from ascitic fluid by DEAE affi-gel blue chromatography (1982) J Immunol Methods, 53, pp. 313-320; Davis, R.W., Botstein, D., Roth, J.R., (1980) Advanced bacterial genetics, , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; Dewey, R.E., Levings, C.S.I.I.I., Timothy, D.H., Novel recombinations in the maize mitochondrial genome produce a unique transcriptional unit in the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (1986) Cell, 44, pp. 439-449; Escote, L.J., Gabay-Laughnan, S.J., Laughnan, J.R., Cytoplasmic reversion to fertility in cms-S maize need not involve loss of linear mitochondrial plasmids (1985) Plasmid, 14, pp. 264-267; Forde, B.G., Leaver, C.J., Nuclear and cytoplasmic genes controlling sythesis of variant mitochondrial polypeptides in malesterile maize (1980) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 77, pp. 418-422; Forde, B.G., Oliver, R.J.C., Leaver, C.J., Variation in mitochondrial translation products associated with male-sterile cytoplasms in maize (1978) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 75, pp. 3841-3845; Hames, B.D., Rickwood, D., (1981) Gel electrophoresis of proteins, , IRL Press, Oxford, Washington, DC; Houchins, J.P., Ginsburg, H., Rohrbaugh, M., Dale, R.M.K., Schardl, C.L., Hodge, T.P., Lonsdale, D.M., DNA sequence analysis of a 5.27-kb direct repeat occurring adjacent to the regions of S-episome homology in maize mitochondria (1986) EMBO J, 5, pp. 2781-2788; Huynh, T.V., Young, R.A., Davis, R.W., Constructing and screening cDNA libraties in λgt10 and λgt11 (1985) DNA cloning: A practical approach, vol 1, pp. 49-78. , D.M., Glover, IRL Press, Oxford; Ishige, T., Storey, K.K., Gengenbach, B.G., Cytoplasmic fertile revertants possessing S1 and S2 DNAs in S male-sterile maize (1985) Ikushugaku zasshi, 35, pp. 285-291; Kemble, R.J., Bedbrook, J.R., A rapid assay for detecting malesterile maize lines possessing S-type cytoplasm (1979) Maydica, 24, pp. 175-180; Kemble, R.J., Mans, R.J., Examination of the mitochondrial genome of revertant progeny from S- cms maize with cloned S-1 and S-2 hybridization probes (1983) J Mol Appl Genet, 2, pp. 161-171; Kemble, R.J., Thompson, R.D., S1 and S2 the linear mitochondrial DNAs present in a male sterile line of maize, possess terminally attached proteins (1982) Nucleic Acids Research, 10, pp. 8181-8190; Kemble, R.J., Gunn, R.E., Flavell, R.B., Classification of normal and male sterile cytoplasms in maize. 2.
