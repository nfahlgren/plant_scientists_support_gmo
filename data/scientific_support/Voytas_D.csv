We employed fibroblasts derived from a patient with Fanconi anemia as a model to test the ability of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 nuclease system to mediate gene correction. We show that the Cas9 nuclease and nickase each resulted in gene correction, but the nickase, because of its ability to preferentially mediate homology-directed repair, resulted in a higher frequency of corrected clonal isolates. To assess the off-target effects, we used both a predictive software platform to identify intragenic sequences of homology as well as a genome-wide screen utilizing linear amplification-mediated PCR. We observed no off-target activity and show RNA-guided endonuclease candidate sites that do not possess low sequence complexity function in a highly specific manner. Collectively, we provide proof of principle for precision genome editing in Fanconi anemia, a DNA repair-deficient human disorder. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",,"endonuclease; nuclease; palindromic DNA; RNA; Article; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; computer program; CRISPR Cas system; DNA repair; Fanconi anemia; fibroblast; gene amplification; gene sequence; genome; hematopoietic cell; hematopoietic stem cell; human; human cell; human tissue; polymerase chain reaction; targeted gene repair; transplantation",,"endonuclease, 9055-11-2; nuclease, 9026-81-7; RNA, 63231-63-0",,,"Fanconi Anemia Research Fund; Fanconi Anemia Research Fund","Huard, C.C., Tremblay, C.S., Helsper, K., Fanconi anemia proteins interact with CtBP1 and modulate the expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (2013) Blood, 121, pp. 1729-1739; Whitney, M.A., Jakobs, P., Kaback, M., The Ashkenazi Jewish Fanconi anemia mutation: Incidence among patients and carrier frequency in the at-risk population (1994) Hum Mutat, 3, pp. 339-341; Whitney, M.A., Saito, H., Jakobs, P.M., A common mutation in the FACC gene causes Fanconi anaemia in Ashkenazi Jews (1993) Nat Genet, 4, pp. 202-205; Grompe, M., D'Andrea, A., Fanconi anemia and DNA repair (2001) Hum Mol Genet, 10, pp. 2253-2259; Pickering, A., Zhang, J., Panneerselvam, J., Fei, P., Advances in the understanding of Fanconi anemia tumor suppressor pathway (2013) Cancer Biol Ther, 14, pp. 1089-1091; Macmillan, M.L., Wagner, J.E., Haematopoeitic cell transplantation for Fanconi anaemia-when and how?

TALENs enable researchers to make DNA double-strand breaks in target loci to create gene knockouts or introduce specific DNA sequence modifications. Precise genome engineering is increasingly being used to study gene function, develop disease models or create new traits in crop species. Underlying the boom in genome engineering is the striking simplicity and low cost of engineering new specificities of TALENs and other sequence-specific nucleases. In this chapter, we describe a rapid, inexpensive, and user-friendly protocol for custom TALEN construction based on one of the most popular TALEN assembly platforms, the Golden Gate cloning method. Using this protocol, ready-to-use TALENs with specificity for targets 13-32 bp long are constructed within 5 days. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","Argeted mutagenesis; Genome engineering;

These systems can be employed for a variety of purposes, ranging from producing compounds of industrial or therapeutic value, to reducing crop losses by altering cellular responses to pathogens or climate change. To realize the full potential of plant synthetic biology, techniques are required that provide control over the genetic code - enabling targeted modifications to DNA sequences within living plant cells. Such control is now within reach owing to recent advances in the use of sequence-specific nucleases to precisely engineer genomes.

Upon high-temperature processing, these reducing sugars react with free amino acids, resulting in brown, bitter-tasting products and elevated levels of acrylamide-a potential carcinogen. To minimize the accumulation of reducing sugars, RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to silence the vacuolar invertase gene (VInv), which encodes a protein that breaks down sucrose to glucose and fructose. Because RNAi often results in incomplete gene silencing and requires the plant to be transgenic, here we used transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to knockout VInv within the commercial potato variety, Ranger Russet. We isolated 18 plants containing mutations in at least one VInv allele, and five of these plants had mutations in all VInv alleles. Tubers from full VInv-knockout plants had undetectable levels of reducing sugars, and processed chips contained reduced levels of acrylamide and were lightly coloured. Furthermore, seven of the 18 modified plant lines appeared to contain no TALEN DNA insertions in the potato genome. These results provide a framework for using TALENs to quickly improve traits in commercially relevant autotetraploid potato lines. © 2015 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Acrylamide reduction; Cold-induced sweetening; Gene editing; Potato; Transcription activator-like effector nucleases; Vacuolar invertase",,,,,,,,"Zhang, F.",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,14677644,,,,"English","Plant Biotechnol.

Here we demonstrate targeted and stable modifications of the genome of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using both meganucleases and TALE nucleases. When nuclease-encoding constructs are co-transformed with a selectable marker, high frequencies of genome modifications are readily attained with 56 and 27% of the colonies exhibiting targeted mutagenesis or targeted gene insertion, respectively. The generation of an enhanced lipid-producing strain (45-fold increase in triacylglycerol accumulation) through the disruption of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene exemplifies the power of genome engineering to harness diatoms for biofuel production. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we use geminivirus-based replicons for transient expression of sequence-specific nucleases (zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator- like effector nucleases, and the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat/Cas system) and delivery of DNA repair templates. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), replicons based on the bean yellow dwarf virus enhanced gene targeting frequencies one to two orders of magnitude over conventional Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA. In addition to the nuclease-mediated DNA doublestrand breaks, gene targeting was promoted by replication of the repair template and pleiotropic activity of the geminivirus replication initiator proteins. We demonstrate the feasibility of using geminivirus replicons to generate plants with a desired DNA sequence modification. By adopting a general plant transformation method, plantlets with a desired DNA change were regenerated in <6 weeks. These results, in addition to the large host range of geminiviruses, advocate the use of replicons for plant genome engineering. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The trans-fatty acids produced through hydrogenation pose a health threat. Soybean lines that are low in polyunsaturated fats were generated by introducing mutations in two fatty acid desaturase 2 genes (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B), which in the seed convert the monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, to the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic acid. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to recognize and cleave conserved DNA sequences in both genes. In four of 19 transgenic soybean lines expressing the TALENs, mutations in FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B were observed in DNA extracted from leaf tissue; three of the four lines transmitted heritable FAD2-1 mutations to the next generation. The fatty acid profile of the seed was dramatically changed in plants homozygous for mutations in both FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B: oleic acid increased from 20% to 80% and linoleic acid decreased from 50% to under 4%. Further, mutant plants were identified that lacked the TALEN transgene and only carried the targeted mutations. The ability to create a valuable trait in a single generation through targeted modification of a gene family demonstrates the power of TALENs for genome engineering and crop improvement. © 2014 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Fatty acid desaturase; Linoleic acid; Metabolic engineering; Oleic acid; Targeted mutagenesis","acyl coenzyme A desaturase; fatty acid; oleic acid; soybean oil; vegetable protein; chemistry; enzymology; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; nutritional value; plant seed; sequence alignment; site directed mutagenesis; soybean; transgenic plant; Base Sequence; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Fatty Acids; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; Nutritive Value; Oleic Acid; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Seeds; Sequence Alignment; Soybean Oil; Soybeans",,"acyl coenzyme A desaturase, 9014-34-0; oleic acid, 112-80-1, 115-06-0; soybean oil, 8001-22-7; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Fatty Acids; Oleic Acid; Plant Proteins; Soybean Oil",,,,"Alt, J., Fehr, W., Welke, G., Sandhu, D., Phenotypic and molecular analysis of oleate content in the mutant soybean line M23 (2005) Crop Sci., 45, pp. 1997-2000; Anai, T., Yamada, T., Hideshima, R., Kinoshita, T., Rahman, S., Takagi, Y., Two high-oleic-acid soybean mutants, M23 and KK21, have disrupted microsomal omega-6 fatty acid desaturase, encoded by GmFAD2-1A (2008) Breed.

Recent advances in genome engineering make it possible to precisely alter DNA sequences in living cells, providing unprecedented control over a plant's genetic material. Potential future crops derived through genome engineering include those that better withstand pests, that have enhanced nutritional value, and that are able to grow on marginal lands. In many instances, crops with such traits will be created by altering only a few nucleotides among the billions that comprise plant genomes. As such, and with the appropriate regulatory structures in place, crops created through genome engineering might prove to be more acceptable to the public than plants that carry foreign DNA in their genomes. Public perception and the performance of the engineered crop varieties will determine the extent to which this powerful technology contributes towards securing the world's food supply. © 2014 Voytas, Gao.",,"agriculture; article; CRISPR Cas system; crop improvement; DNA end joining repair; DNA sequence; double stranded DNA break; genetic engineering; homologous recombination; nonhuman; nutrient content; nutritional value; pest resistance; photosynthesis; plant breeding; plant genome; transgenic crop",,,,,"31271795, NSFC, National Science Foundation; DBI 0923827, NSF, National Science Foundation","Lippman, Z.B., Zamir, D., Heterosis: revisting the magic (2007) Trends Genet, 23, pp. 60-66; Pingali, P.L., Green revolution: impacts, limits, and the path ahead (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 109, pp. 12302-12308; Clive, J., (2012) Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2012, , ISAAA Brief No. 44.

This ZFN-induced mutagenesis method is an alternative to other currently available gene knockout or knockdown technologies and is useful for reverse genetic studies. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Arabidopsis; CoDA; Mutagenesis; NHEJ; ZFN","zinc finger nuclease; Arabidopsis; article; gene expression; gene locus; gene mutation; knockout gene; priority journal; reverse genetics; seedling; somatic cell; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis",,,,,"0209818, MCB, National Science Foundation; 0923827, DBI, National Science Foundation; 0923827, NSF, National Science Foundation","Alonso, J.M., Ecker, J.R., Moving forward in reverse: Genetic technologies to enable genome-wide phenomic screens in Arabidopsis (2006) Nat Rev Genet, 7, pp. 524-536; Alonso, J.M., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Sessions, A., A high-throughput Arabidopsis reverse genetics system (2002) Plant Cell, 14, pp. 2985-2994; Woody, S.T., The WiscDsLox T-DNA collection: An arabidopsis community resource generated by using an improved high-throughput T-DNA sequencing pipeline (2007) J Plant Res, 120, pp. 157-165; McCallum, C.M., Targeted screening for induced mutations (2000) Nat Biotechnol, 18, pp. 455-457; Bush, S.M., Krysan, P.J., ITILLING: A personalized approach to the identification of induced mutations in Arabidopsis (2011) Plant Physiol, 154, pp. 25-35; Kim, Y.G., Cha, J., Chandrasegaran, S., Hybrid restriction enzymes: Zinc finger fusions to Fok i cleavage domain (1996) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 93, pp. 1156-1160; Bibikova, M., Stimulation of homologous recombination through targeted cleavage by chimeric nucleases (2001) Mol Cell Biol, 21, pp. 289-297; Bitinaite, J., FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 95, pp. 10570-10575; Townsend, J.A., High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 442-445; Carroll, D., Genome engineering with zinc-finger nucleases (2011) Genetics, 188, pp. 773-782; Zhang, F., High frequency targeted mutagenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana using zinc finger nucleases (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 107, pp. 12028-12033; Shukla, V.K., Precise genome modification in the crop species Zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 437-441; Osakabe, K., Osakabe, Y., Toki, S., Sitedirected mutagenesis in Arabidopsis using custom-designed zinc finger nucleases (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 107, pp. 12034-12039; Doyon, Y., Heritable targeted gene disruption in zebrafish using designed zincfinger nucleases (2008) Nat Biotechnol, 26, pp. 702-708; Kim, S., Preassembled zinc-finger arrays for rapid construction of ZFNs (2011) Nat Methods, 8, p. 7; Ramirez, C.L., Unexpected failure rates for modular assembly of engineered zinc fingers (2008) Nat Methods, 5, pp. 374-375; Maeder, M.L., Rapid ""open-source"" engineering of customized zinc-finger nucleases for highly efficient gene modification (2008) Mol Cell, 31, pp. 294-301; Sander, J.D., Selection-free zincfinger-nuclease engineering by contextdependent assembly (CoDA) (2011) Nat Methods, 8, pp. 67-69; Curtin, S.J., Targeted mutagenesis of duplicated genes in soybean with zinc-finger nucleases (2011) Plant Physiol, 156, pp. 466-473; Sander, J.D., Maeder, M.L., Joung, J.K., Engineering designer nucleases with customized cleavage specificities (2011) Curr Protoc Mol Biol Chapter, 12. , Unit12 13. doi 10:1002/0471142727.mb1213s96; Osborn, M.J., Synthetic zinc finger nuclease design and rapid assembly (2011) Hum Gene Ther, 22, pp. 1155-1165; Curtis, M.D., Grossniklaus, U., A gateway cloning vector set for high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta (2003) Plant Physiol, 133, pp. 462-469; Koncz, C., High-frequency T-DNAmediated gene tagging in plants (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 86, pp. 8467-8471; Wright, D.A., Standardized reagents and protocols for engineering zinc finger nucleases by modular assembly (2006) Nat Protoc, 1, pp. 1637-1652; Sander, J.D., ZiFiT (zinc finger targeter): An updated zinc finger engineering tool (2010) Nucleic Acids Res, 38, pp. W462-W468; Clough, S.J., Bent, A.F., Floral dip: A simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana (1998) Plant J, 16, pp. 735-743; Miller, J.C., An improved zincfinger nuclease architecture for highly specific genome editing (2007) Nat Biotechnol, 25, pp. 778-785; Szymczak, A.L., Correction of multigene deficiency in vivo using a single ""selfcleaving"" 2A peptide-based retroviral vector (2004) Nat Biotechnol, 22, pp. 589-594; Guschin, D.Y., A rapid and general assay for monitoring endogenous gene modifi-cation (2010) Methods Mol Biol, 649, pp. 247-256; Herrmann, F., P53 Gene repair with zinc finger nucleases optimised by yeast 1-hybrid and validated by Solexa sequencing (2011) PLoS One, 6, pp. e20913",,,,"Humana Press Inc.",,,,,10643745,9781627035798,,,"English","Methods Mol.

Their hallmark feature is a customizable central string of polymorphic amino acid repeats that interact one-to-one with individual DNA bases to specify the target. Sequences targeted by TAL effector repeats in nature are nearly all directly preceded by a thymine (T) that is required for maximal activity, and target sites for custom TAL effector constructs have typically been selected with this constraint. Multiple crystal structures suggest that this requirement for T at base 0 is encoded by a tryptophan residue (W232) in a cryptic repeat N-terminal to the central repeats that exhibits energetically favorable van der Waals contacts with the T. We generated variants based on TAL effector PthXo1 with all single amino acid substitutions for W232. In a transcriptional activation assay, many substitutions altered or relaxed the specificity for T and a few were as active as wild type. Some showed higher activity. However, when replicated in a different TAL effector, the effects of the substitutions differed. Further, the effects differed when tested in the context of a TALEN in a DNA cleavage assay, and in a TAL effector-DNA binding assay. Substitution of the N-terminal region of the PthXo1 construct with that of one of the TAL effector-like proteins of Ralstonia solanacearum, which have arginine in place of the tryptophan, resulted in specificity for guanine as the 5′ base but low activity, and several substitutions for the arginine, including tryptophan, destroyed activity altogether. Thus, the effects on specificity and activity generated by substitutions at the W232 (or equivalent) position are complex and context dependent. Generating TAL effector scaffolds with high activity that robustly accommodate sites without a T at position 0 may require larger scale re-engineering. © 2013 Doyle et al.",,"arginine; guanine; hybrid protein; nuclease; transcription activator like effector; transcription activator like effector nuclease fusion protein; transcription activator like effector PthXo1; transcription factor; tryptophan; unclassified drug; amino acid substitution; amino terminal sequence; article; binding site; complex formation; controlled study; crystal structure; DNA binding; DNA cleavage; DNA sequence; enzyme active site; gene; gene construct; gene targeting; genetic engineering; genetic variability; long terminal repeat; nonhuman; protein function; PthXo1 gene; Ralstonia solanacearum; transcription initiation; transcription regulation; wild type; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacterial Proteins; DNA; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Ralstonia solanacearum; Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity; Transcription Factors; Tryptophan",,"arginine, 1119-34-2, 15595-35-4, 7004-12-8, 74-79-3; guanine, 69257-39-2, 73-40-5; nuclease, 9026-81-7; tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3",,,"R01 GM098861, NIH, National Institutes of Health; R01 GM088277, NIH, National Institutes of Health","Doyle, E.L., Stoddard, B.L., Voytas, D.F., Bogdanove, A.J., TAL effectors: Highly adaptable phytobacterial virulence factors and readily engineered DNA-targeting proteins (2013) Trends Cell Biol, , (.

Thus, endocrine therapies that inhibit the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) are effective in treating PCa. AR transcriptional reactivation is central to resistance, as evidenced by the efficacy of AR retargeting in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) with next-generation endocrine therapies abiraterone and enzalutamide. However, resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide limits this efficacy in most men, and PCa remains the second-leading cause of male cancer deaths. Here we show that AR gene rearrangements in CRPC tissues underlie a completely androgen-independent, yet AR-dependent, resistance mechanism. We discovered intragenic AR gene rearrangements in CRPC tissues, which we modeled using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome engineering. This modeling revealed that these AR gene rearrangements blocked full-length AR synthesis, but promoted expression of truncated AR variant proteins lacking the AR ligand- binding domain. Furthermore, these AR variant proteins maintained the constitutive activity of the AR transcriptional program and a CRPC growth phenotype independent of full-length AR or androgens. These findings demonstrate that AR gene rearrangements are a unique resistance mechanism by which AR transcriptional activity can be uncoupled from endocrine regulation in CRPC.",,"abiraterone; androgen receptor;

The primary advantage of TALENs over other sequence-specific nucleases, namely zinc finger nucleases and meganucleases, lies in their ease of assembly, reliability of function, and their broad targeting range. Here we report the assembly of several TALENs for a specific genomic locus in barley. The cleavage activity of individual TALENs was first tested in vivo using a yeast-based, single-strand annealing assay. The most efficient TALEN was then selected for barley transformation. Analysis of the resulting transformants showed that TALEN-induced double strand breaks led to the introduction of short deletions at the target site. Additional analysis revealed that each barley transformant contained a range of different mutations, indicating that mutations occurred independently in different cells. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cereal transformation; Hordeum vulgare; TAL effector nucleases; TALEN; Targeted mutagenesis","endonuclease; transcription factor; article; genetic transformation; genetics; Hordeum; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; plant genome; sequence homology; Base Sequence; Endonucleases; Genome, Plant; Hordeum; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Transcription Factors; Transformation, Genetic",,"endonuclease, 9055-11-2; Endonucleases, 3.1.-; Transcription Factors",,,"DBI 0923827, NSF, National Science Foundation","Bedell, V.M., Wang, Y., Campbell, J.M., Poshusta, T.L., Starker, C.G., Krug Ii, R.G., Tan, W., Ekker, S.C., In vivo genome editing using a high-efficiency TALEN system (2012) Nature, 491 (7422), pp. 114-118. , doi:10.1038/nature11537; Bogdanove, A.J., Voytas, D.F., TAL effectors: customizable proteins for DNA targeting (2011) Science, 333, pp. 1843-1846. , doi:10.1126/science.1204094; Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Christian, M., Wang, L., Zhang, Y., Schmidt, C., Baller, J.A., Voytas, D.F., Efficient design and assembly of custom TALEN and other TAL effector-based constructs for DNA targeting (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, 39 (12), pp. e82. , doi:10.1093/nar/gkr218; Christian, M., Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Schmidt, C., Zhang, F., Hummel, A., Bogdanove, A.J., Voytas, D.F., Targeting DNA double-strand breaks with TAL effector nucleases (2010) Genetics, 186 (2), pp. 757-761. , doi:10.1534/genetics.110.120717; Christian, M.L., Demorest, Z.L., Starker, C.G., Osborn, M.J., Nyquist, M.D., Zhang, Y., Carlson, D.F., Voytas, D.F., Targeting G with TAL effectors: a comparison of activities of TALENs constructed with NN and NK repeat variable di-residues (2012) PLoS ONE, 7 (9), pp. e45383. , doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0045383; Dahlem, T.J., Hoshijima, K., Jurynec, M.J., Gunther, D., Starker, C.G., Locke, A.S., Weis, A.M., Grunwald, D.J., Simple methods for generating and detecting locus-specific mutations induced with TALENs in the zebrafish genome (2012) PLoS Genet, 8, pp. e1002861. , doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002861; Dionisio, G., Madsen, C.K., Holm, P.B., Welinder, K.G., Jørgensen, M., Stroger, E., Arcalis, E., Brinch-Pedersen, H., Cloning and characterization of purple acid phosphatase phytases from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), maize (Zea maize L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.)

The situation becomes more complicated in polyploidy or paleopolyploid genomes that have two or more copies for most genes. Here we describe a method for engineering zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) for the purpose of creating targeted mutations in the paleopolyploid soybean genome. ZFNs are recombinant proteins composed of an engineered zinc-finger array fused to a nonspecific cleavage domain. When engineered to recognize a specific nucleotide sequence, the cleavage domain will generate highly mutagenic DNA double-strand breaks frequently resulting in insertions and deletions at the target locus. Depending on the number of target sites present within the genome, this method has the capacity to target either single- or multi-copy gene families. In this chapter, we describe an inexpensive, rapid, and user-friendly approach for ZFN assembly and application in soybean based on the previously described context-dependent assembly method. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Duplication; Legume; Mutagenesis; Polyploidy; Soybean; TALEN; ZFN","DNA; nucleotide; zinc finger nuclease; analytic method; article; controlled study; double stranded DNA break; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene frequency; gene function; gene insertion; gene locus; gene targeting; genetic analysis; legume; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant genome; polyploidy; priority journal; protein assembly; protein cleavage; protein domain; site directed mutagenesis; soybean; Codon; Computational Biology; Endonucleases; Fabaceae; Gene Duplication; Gene Targeting; Internet; Mutagenesis; Soybeans; Zinc Fingers",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,"Curtin, S.J., Voytas, D.F., Stupar, R.M., Genome engineering of crops with designer nucleases (2012) Plant Genome, 5, pp. 42-50; Kim, Y.G., Cha, J., Chandrasegaran, S., Hybrid restriction enzymes: Zinc finger fusions to Fok i cleavage domain (1996) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 93, pp. 1156-1160; Bibikova, M., Beumer, K., Trautman, J.K., Carroll, D., Enhancing gene targeting with designed zinc finger nucleases (2003) Science, 300, p. 764; Porteus, M.H., Baltimore, D., Chimeric nucleases stimulate gene targeting in human cells (2003) Science, 300, p. 763; Maeder, M.L., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Osiak, A., Wright, D.A., Anthony, R.M., Eichtinger, M., Rapid ""open-source"" engineering of customized zinc-finger nucleases for highly efficient gene modification (2008) Mol Cell, 31, pp. 294-301; Sander, J.D., Dahlborg, E.J., Goodwin, M.J., Cade, L., Zhang, F., Cifuentes, D., Selectionfree zinc-finger-nuclease engineering by context-dependent assembly (CoDA) (2011) Nat Methods, 8, pp. 67-69; Lloyd, A., Plaisier, C.L., Carroll, D., Drews, G.N., Targeted mutagenesis using zinc-finger nucleases in Arabidopsis (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 102, pp. 2232-2237; Wright, D.A., Townsend, J.A., Winfrey, R.J., Irwin, P.A., Rajagopal, J., Lonosky, P.M., High-frequency homologous recombination in plants mediated by zinc-finger nucleases (2005) Plant J, 44, pp. 693-705; Townsend, J.A., Wright, D.A., Winfrey, R.J., Fu, F., Maeder, M.L., Joung, J.K., Voytas, D.F., High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 442-445; Shukla, V.K., Doyon, Y., Miller, J.C., Dekelver, R.C., Moehle, E.A., Worden, S.E., Precise genome modification in the crop species Zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 437-441; Gao, H., Smith, J., Yang, M., Jones, S., Djukanovic, V., Nicholson, M.G., Heritable targeted mutagenesis in maize using a designed endonuclease (2010) Plant J, 61, pp. 176-187; Curtin, S.J., Zhang, F., Sander, J.D., Haun, W.J., Starker, C., Baltes, N.J., Targeted mutagenesis of duplicated genes in soybean with zinc-finger nucleases (2011) Plant Physiol, 156, pp. 466-473; Li, T., Liu, B., Spalding, M.H., Weeks, D.P., Yang, B., High-efficiency TALEN-based gene editing produces disease-resistant rice (2012) Nat Biotechnol, 30, pp. 390-392; Wright, D.A., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Sander, J.D., Winfrey, R.J., Hirsh, A.S., Eichtinger, M., Standardized reagents and protocols for engineering zinc finger nucleases by modular assembly (2006) Nat Protoc, 1, pp. 1637-1652; Ramirez, C.L., Foley, J.E., Wright, D.A., Muller-Lerch, F., Rahman, S.H., Cornu, T.I., Unexpected failure rates for modular assembly of engineered zinc fingers (2008) Nat Methods, 5, pp. 374-375; Zhang, F., Maeder, M.L., Unger-Wallace, E., Hoshaw, J.P., Reyon, D., Christian, M., High frequency targeted mutagenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana using zinc finger nucleases (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 107, pp. 12028-12033; Paz, M.M., Martinez, J.C., Kalvig, A.B., Fonger, T.M., Wang, K., Improved cotyledonary node method using an alternative explant derived from mature seed for efficient Agrobacteriummediated soybean transformation (2006) Plant Cell Rep, 25, pp. 206-213; Sato, S., Nakamura, Y., Kaneko, T., Asamizu, E., Kato, T., Nakao, M., Genome structure of the legume, Lotus japonicus (2008) DNA Res, 15, pp. 227-239; Schmutz, J., Cannon, S.B., Schlueter, J., Ma, J., Mitros, T., Nelson, W., Genome sequence of the palaeopolyploid soybean (2010) Nature, 463, pp. 178-183; Kim, M.Y., Lee, S., Van, K., Kim, T.H., Jeong, S.C., Choi, I.Y., Whole-genome sequencing and intensive analysis of the undomesticated soybean (Glycine soja Sieb.

They function as virulence factors by activating host genes important for disease, or as avirulence factors by turning on genes that provide resistance. DNA-binding specificity is encoded by polymorphic repeats in each protein that correspond one-to-one with different nucleotides. This code has facilitated target identification and opened new avenues for engineering disease resistance. It has also enabled TAL effector customization for targeted gene control, genome editing, and other applications.

Gene augmentation therapies are promising, but run the risk of insertional mutagenesis. To abrogate this risk, we explored the possibility of using engineered transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) for precise genome editing. We report the ability of TALEN to induce site-specific double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) leading to homology-directed repair (HDR) from an exogenous donor template. This process resulted in COL7A1 gene mutation correction in primary fibroblasts that were subsequently reprogrammed into inducible pluripotent stem cells and showed normal protein expression and deposition in a teratoma-based skin model in vivo. Deep sequencing-based genome-wide screening established a safety profile showing on-target activity and three off-target (OT) loci that, importantly, were at least 10 kb from a coding sequence. This study provides proof-of-concept for TALEN-mediated in situ correction of an endogenous patient-specific gene mutation and used an unbiased screen for comprehensive TALEN target mapping that will cooperatively facilitate translational application. © The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy.",,"collagen type 7; genomic DNA; messenger RNA; nuclease; transcription activator like effector nuclease; unclassified drug; animal tissue; article; COL7A1 gene; DNA template; double stranded DNA break; epidermolysis bullosa; gene; gene locus; gene mapping; gene mutation; gene targeting; genetic association; genetic code; genetic engineering; genetic screening; human; human cell; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; pluripotent stem cell; protein expression; stem cell gene therapy; targeted gene repair; teratoma; Base Composition; Chromosome Mapping; Collagen Type VII; Deoxyribonucleases; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica; Fibroblasts; Gene Deletion; Gene Targeting; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genes, Recessive; Genetic Loci; Genetic Therapy; Genotype; HEK293 Cells; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenotype; Recombinational DNA Repair; Reproducibility of Results; Selection, Genetic; Transcriptional Activation",,"nuclease, 9026-81-7; COL7A1 protein, human; Collagen Type VII; Deoxyribonucleases, 3.1.-",,,,"Hacein-Bey-Abina, S., Garrigue, A., Wang, G.P., Soulier, J., Lim, A., Morillon, E., Insertional oncogenesis in 4 patients after retrovirus-mediated gene therapy of SCID-X1 (2008) J Clin Invest, 118, pp. 3132-3142; Hacein-Bey-Abina, S., Von Kalle, C., Schmidt, M., McCormack, M.P., Wulffraat, N., Leboulch, P., LMO2-associated clonal T cell proliferation in two patients after gene therapy for SCID-X1 (2003) Science, 302, pp. 415-419; Daya, S., Berns, K.I., Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus vectors (2008) Clin Microbiol Rev, 21, pp. 583-593; Thomas, C.E., Ehrhardt, A., Kay, M.A., Progress and problems with the use of viral vectors for gene therapy (2003) Nat Rev Genet, 4, pp. 346-358; Yant, S.R., Wu, X., Huang, Y., Garrison, B., Burgess, S.M., Kay, M.A., Highresolution genome-wide mapping of transposon integration in mammals (2005) Mol Cell Biol, 25, pp. 2085-2094; Doetschman, T., Gregg, R.G., Maeda, N., Hooper, M.L., Melton, D.W., Thompson, S., Targetted correction of a mutant HPRT gene in mouse embryonic stem cells (1987) Nature, 330, pp. 576-578; Porteus, M.H., Baltimore, D., Chimeric nucleases stimulate gene targeting in human cells (2003) Science, 300, p. 763; Stoddard, B.L., Homing endonucleases: From microbial genetic invaders to reagents for targeted DNA modifcation (2011) Structure, 19, pp. 7-15; Pâques, F., Duchateau, P., Meganucleases and DNA double-strand break-induced recombination: Perspectives for gene therapy (2007) Curr Gene Ther, 7, pp. 49-66; Ramirez, C.L., Foley, J.E., Wright, D.A., Müller-Lerch, F., Rahman, S.H., Cornu, T.I., Unexpected failure rates for modular assembly of engineered zinc fngers (2008) Nat Methods, 5, pp. 374-375; Maeder, M.L., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Osiak, A., Wright, D.A., Anthony, R.M., Eichtinger, M., Rapid ""open-source"" engineering of customized zinc-fnger nucleases for highly effcient gene modifcation (2008) Mol Cell, 31, pp. 294-301; Maeder, M.L., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Sander, J.D., Voytas, D.F., Joung, J.K., Oligomerized pool engineering (OPEN): An 'open-source' protocol for making customized zinc-fnger arrays (2009) Nat Protoc, 4, pp. 1471-1501; Pruett-Miller, S.M., Connelly, J.P., Maeder, M.L., Joung, J.K., Porteus, M.H., Comparison of zinc fnger nucleases for use in gene targeting in mammalian cells (2008) Mol Ther, 16, pp. 707-717; Mali, P., Yang, L., Esvelt, K.M., Aach, J., Guell, M., Dicarlo, J.E., RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9 (2013) Science, 339, pp. 823-826; Cong, L., Ran, F.A., Cox, D., Lin, S., Barretto, R., Habib, N., Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems (2013) Science, 339, pp. 819-823; Hwang, W.Y., Fu, Y., Reyon, D., Maeder, M.L., Tsai, S.Q., Sander, J.D., Effcient genome editing in zebrafsh using a CRISPR-Cas system (2013) Nat Biotechnol, 31, pp. 227-229; Christian, M., Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Schmidt, C., Zhang, F., Hummel, A., Targeting DNA double-strand breaks with TAL effector nucleases (2010) Genetics, 186, pp. 757-761; Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Christian, M., Wang, L., Zhang, Y., Schmidt, C., Effcient design and assembly of custom TALEN and other TAL effector-based constructs for DNA targeting (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, 39, pp. e82; Fine, J.D., Mellerio, J.E., Extracutaneous manifestations and complications of inherited epidermolysis bullosa: Part II.

These artificial nucleases offer high specificity coupled with simplicity in design that results from the ability to serially chain transcription activator-like effector repeat arrays to target individual DNA bases. However, these benefits come at the cost of an appreciably large multimeric protein complex, in which DNA cleavage is governed by the nonspecific FokI nuclease domain. Here we report a significant improvement to the standard transcription activator-like effector nuclease architecture by leveraging the partially specific I-TevI catalytic domain to create a new class of monomeric, DNA-cleaving enzymes. In vivo yeast, plant and mammalian cell assays demonstrate that the half-size, single-polypeptide compact transcription activator-like effector nucleases exhibit overall activity and specificity comparable to currently available designer nucleases. In addition, we harness the catalytic mechanism of I-TevI to generate novel compact transcription activator-like effector nuclease-based nicking enzymes that display a greater than 25-fold increase in relative targeted gene correction efficacy. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is now possible for most bench scientists to alter DNA in living plant cells in a variety of ways, including introducing specific nucleotide substitutions in a gene that change a protein's amino acid sequence, deleting genes or chromosomal segments, and inserting foreign DNA at precise genomic locations. Such targeted DNA sequence modifications are enabled by sequence-specific nucleases that create double-strand breaks in the genomic loci to be altered. The repair of the breaks, through either homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining, can be controlled to achieve the desired sequence modification. Genome engineering promises to advance basic plant research by linking DNA sequences to biological function. Further, genome engineering will enable plants' biosynthetic capacity to be harnessed to produce the many agricultural products required by an expanding world population. © Copyright ©2013 by Annual Reviews.

However, the success of genome modification is largely dependent on the intrinsic activity of the engineered nucleases. In this study, we sought to enhance ZFNmediated targeted mutagenesis and gene targeting (GT) in Arabidopsis by manipulating DNA repair pathways. Using a ZFN that creates a double-strand break (DSB) at the endogenous ADH1 locus, we analyzed repair outcomes in the absence of DNA repair proteins such as KU70 and LIG4 (both involved in classic nonhomologous end-joining, NHEJ) and SMC6B (involved in sister-chromatid-based homologous recombination, HR). We achieved a fivefold to 16-fold enhancement in HR-based GT in a ku70 mutant and a threefold to fourfold enhancement in GT in the lig4 mutant. Although the NHEJ mutagenesis frequency was not significantly changed in ku70 or lig4, DNA repair was shifted to microhomology-dependent alternative NHEJ. As a result, mutations in both ku70 and lig4 were predominantly large deletions, which facilitates easy screening for mutations by PCR. Interestingly, NHEJ mutagenesis and GT at the ADH1 locus were enhanced by sixfold to eightfold and threefold to fourfold, respectively, in a smc6b mutant. The increase in NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis by loss of SMC6B was further confirmed using ZFNs that target two other Arabidopsis genes, namely, TT4 and MPK8. Considering that components of DNA repair pathways are highly conserved across species, mutations in DNA repair genes likely provide a universal strategy for harnessing repair pathways to achieve desired targeted genome modifications. © 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",,"DNA;

Here, we describe methods for the targeted modification of plant genomes using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). Methods were optimized using tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) protoplasts and TALENs targeting the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene. Optimal TALEN scaffolds were identified using a protoplast-based single-strand annealing assay in which TALEN cleavage creates a functional yellow fluorescent protein gene, enabling quantification of TALEN activity by flow cytometry. Single-strand annealing activity data for TALENs with different scaffolds correlated highly with their activity at endogenous targets, as measured by high-throughput DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products encompassing the TALEN recognition sites. TALENs introduced targeted mutations in ALS in 30% of transformed cells, and the frequencies of targeted gene insertion approximated 14%. These efficiencies made it possible to recover genome modifications without selection or enrichment regimes: 32% of tobacco calli generated from protoplasts transformed with TALEN-encoding constructs had TALEN-induced mutations in ALS, and of 16 calli characterized in detail, all had mutations in one allele each of the duplicate ALS genes (SurA and SurB). In calli derived from cells treated with a TALEN and a 322-bp donor molecule differing by 6 bp from the ALS coding sequence, 4% showed evidence of targeted gene replacement. The optimized reagents implemented in plant protoplasts should be useful for targeted modification of cells from diverse plant species and using a variety of means for reagent delivery. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Their utility has been limited, how-ever, by the signicant failure rate of new designs, reecting the complexity of DNA recognition by zinc ngers. Transcription activator-like effector (TALE) DNA-binding domains depend on a simple, one-module-to-one-base-pair recognition code, and they have been very productively incorporated into nucleases (TALENs) for genome engineering. In this report we describe the design of TALENs for a number of different genes in Drosophila, and we explore several parameters of TALEN design. The rate of success with TALENs was substantially greater than for zinc-nger nucleases, and the frequency of mutagenesis was comparable. Knockout mutations were isolated in several genes in which such alleles were not previously available. TALENs are an effective tool for targeted genome manipulation in Drosophila. © 2013 Beumer et al.",,"DNA; nuclease; transcription activator like effector nuclease; unclassified drug; zinc finger nuclease; allele; article; DNA binding; DNA repair; Drosophila melanogaster; gene mutation; gene targeting; genetic engineering; genome; mutagenesis; nonhuman; Drosophila; gene frequency; gene targeting; genetic code; Drosophila melanogaster; Animals; Drosophila melanogaster; Endodeoxyribonucleases; Gene Targeting; Zinc Fingers",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; nuclease, 9026-81-7",,,,"Bassett, A.R., Tibbit, C., Ponting, C.P., Liu, J.L., Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis of Drosophila with the CRISPR/Cas9 System (2013) Cell Rep, 4, pp. 220-228; Bedell, V.M., Wang, Y., Campbell, J.M., Poshusta, T.L., Starker, C.G., In vivo genome editing using a high-efficiency TALEN system (2012) Nature, 491, pp. 114-118; Beumer, K., Bhattacharyya, G., Bibikova, M., Trautman, J.K., Carroll, D., Efficient gene targeting in Drosophila with zinc-finger nucleases (2006) Genetics, 172, pp. 2391-2403; Beumer, K.J., Trautman, J.K., Bozas, A., Liu, J.L., Rutter, J., Efficient gene targeting in Drosophila by direct embryo injection with zinc-finger nucleases (2008) Proc.

For example, approximately 17% of genes are organized in tandem in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The genetic redundancy created by TAGs presents a challenge for reverse genetics. As molecular scissors, engineered zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) make DNA double-strand breaks in a sequence-specific manner. ZFNs thus provide a means to delete TAGs by creating two double-strand breaks in the gene cluster. Using engineered ZFNs, we successfully targeted seven genes from three TAGs on two Arabidopsis chromosomes, including the well-known RPP4 gene cluster, which contains eight resistance (R) genes. The resulting gene cluster deletions ranged from a few kb to 55 kb with frequencies approximating 1% in somatic cells. We also obtained large chromosomal deletions of ~9 Mb at approximately one tenth the frequency, and gene cluster inversions and duplications also were achieved. This study demonstrates the ability to use sequence-specific nucleases in plants to make targeted chromosome rearrangements and create novel chimeric genes for reverse genetics and biotechnology. © 2013 Qi et al.","Arabidopsis; Deletion; Genes (tags); Inversion; Nuclease (ZFN); Tandemly arrayed; Zinc finger","zinc finger nuclease; zinc finger nuclease; Arabidopsis thaliana; article; chromosome; chromosome deletion; chromosome inversion; chromosome rearrangement; controlled study; double stranded DNA break; gene; gene cluster; gene deletion; gene duplication; multigene family; nonhuman; reverse genetics; sequence analysis; somatic cell; tandemly arrayed gene; genetic resistance; plant chromosome; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Eukaryota; Arabidopsis; deletion; inversion; tandemly arrayed genes (TAGs); zinc finger nuclease (ZFN); Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Chromosome Deletion; Endodeoxyribonucleases; Gene Targeting; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Plants, Genetically Modified; Tandem Repeat Sequences; Zinc Fingers",,,,,,"Abbott, J.C., Barakate, A., Pincon, G., Legrand, M., Lapierre, C., Simultaneous suppression of multiple genes by single transgenes Down-regulation of three unrelated lignin biosynthetic genes in tobacco (2002) Plant Physiol, 128, pp. 844-853; Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Kim, C.J., Chen, H., Genomewide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Alvarez, J.P., Pekker, I., Goldshmidt, A., Blum, E., Amsellem, Z., Endogenous and synthetic microRNAs stimulate simultaneous, efficient, and localized regulation of multiple targets in diverse species (2006) Plant Cell, 18, pp. 1134-1151; Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 796-815. , Arabidopsis Genome Initiative; Bogdanove, A.J., Voytas, D.F., TAL effectors: customizable proteins for DNA targeting (2011) Science, 333, pp. 1843-1846; Cai, C.Q., Doyon, Y., Ainley, W.M., Miller, J.C., Dekelver, R.C., Targeted transgene integration in plant cells using designed zinc finger nucleases (2009) Plant Mol.

Here, we used TALENs to modify the genome of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We engineered seven TALENs targeting five Arabidopsis genes, namely ADH1, TT4, MAPKKK1, DSK2B, and NATA2. In pooled seedlings expressing the TALENs, we observed somatic mutagenesis frequencies ranging from 2-15% at the intended targets for all seven TALENs. Somatic mutagenesis frequencies as high as 41-73% were observed in individual transgenic plant lines expressing the TALENs. Additionally, a TALEN pair targeting a tandemly duplicated gene induced a 4.4-kb deletion in somatic cells. For the most active TALEN pairs, namely those targeting ADH1 and NATA2, we found that TALEN-induced mutations were transmitted to the next generation at frequencies of 1.5-12%. Our work demonstrates that TALENs are useful reagents for achieving targeted mutagenesis in this important plant model. © 2013 Christian et al.","Arabidopsis; End-joining; Mutagenesis; Nonhomologous; Nuclease; TAL effector; Targeted; Thaliana","nuclease; tal effector nuclease; unclassified drug; adh1 protein; dsk2b protein; mapkkk1 protein; membrane protein; nata2 protein; reagent; tt4 protein; ADH1 gene; Arabidopsis thaliana; article; DNA modification; dsk2b gene; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene mutation; gene targeting; genetic engineering; mapkkk1 gene; mutagenesis; nata2 gene; nonhuman; plant gene; plant tissue; seedling; somatic cell; transgenic plant; tt4 gene; Arabidopsis; controlled study; gene frequency; plant genome; plant model; protein engineering; protein expression; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis thaliana; nonhomologous end-joining; TAL effector nuclease; targeted mutagenesis; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; DNA Restriction Enzymes; Gene Targeting; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Plants, Genetically Modified",,"nuclease, 9026-81-7",,,,"Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Kim, C.J., Chen, H., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Bancroft, I., Jones, J.D.G., Dean, C., Heterologous transposon tagging of the DRLl locus in Arabidopsis (1993) The Plant Cell, 5, pp. 631-638; Boch, J., Bonas, U., Xanthomonas AvrBs3 family-type III effectors: discovery and function (2010) Annu.

This new technology will be used to help elucidate gene function and develop new and valuable traits. Key to enabling site-directed genome modifications are sequence-specific nucleases that generate targeted double-stranded DNA breaks in genes of interest. To date, three different sequence-specific nuclease systems have been used in crop plants: zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases, also termed ""meganucleases."" In this review, we report on the current state of genome engineering in crop plants, comparing the different nuclease and gene delivery systems.

However, the inability to readily modify the genome in a targeted fashion has been a bottleneck in the field. Here we show that improvements in artificial transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provide a powerful new approach for targeted zebrafish genome editing and functional genomic applications. Using the GoldyTALEN modified scaffold and zebrafish delivery system, we show that this enhanced TALEN toolkit has a high efficiency in inducing locus-specific DNA breaks in somatic and germline tissues. At some loci, this efficacy approaches 100%, including biallelic conversion in somatic tissues that mimics phenotypes seen using morpholino-based targeted gene knockdowns. With this updated TALEN system, we successfully used single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides to precisely modify sequences at predefined locations in the zebrafish genome through homology-directed repair, including the introduction of a custom-designed EcoRV site and a modified loxP (mloxP) sequence into somatic tissue in vivo. We further show successful germline transmission of both EcoRV and mloxP engineered chromosomes. This combined approach offers the potential to model genetic variation as well as to generate targeted conditional alleles. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Although zinc-finger nucleases enable a variety of genome modifications, their application to genetic engineering of livestock has been slowed by technical limitations of embryo-injection, culture of primary cells, and difficulty in producing reliable reagents with a limited budget. In contrast, we found that TALENs could easily be manufactured and that over half (23/36, 64%) demonstrate high activity in primary cells. Cytoplasmic injections of TALEN mRNAs into livestock zygotes were capable of inducing gene KO in up to 75% of embryos analyzed, a portion of which harbored biallelic modification. We also developed a simple transposon coselection strategy for TALEN-mediated gene modification in primary fibroblasts that enabled both enrichment for modified cells and efficient isolation of modified colonies. Coselection after treatment with a single TALEN-pair enabled isolation of colonies with mono- and biallelic modification in up to 54% and 17% of colonies, respectively. Co-selection after treatment with two TALEN-pairs directed against the same chromosome enabled the isolation of colonies harboring large chromosomal deletions and inversions (10% and 4% of colonies, respectively). TALEN-modified Ossabaw swine fetal fibroblasts were effective nuclear donors for cloning, resulting in the creation of miniature swine containing mono- and biallelic mutations of the LDL receptor gene as models of familial hypercholesterolemia. TALENs thus appear to represent a highly facile platform for the modification of livestock genomes for both biomedical and agricultural applications.","Biotechnology; Gene-editing; Tal-effector nuclease","low density lipoprotein receptor;

Consequently, engineered TAL effector proteins have become important reagents for manipulating genomes in vivo. DNA binding by TAL effectors is mediated by arrays of 34 amino acid repeats. In each repeat, one of two amino acids (repeat variable di-residues, RVDs) contacts a base in the DNA target. RVDs with specificity for C, T and A have been described; however, among RVDs that target G, the RVD NN also binds A, and NK is rare among naturally occurring TAL effectors. Here we show that TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) made with NK to specify G have less activity than their NN-containing counterparts: fourteen of fifteen TALEN pairs made with NN showed more activity in a yeast recombination assay than otherwise identical TALENs made with NK. Activity was assayed for three of these TALEN pairs in human cells, and the results paralleled the yeast data. The in vivo data is explained by in vitro measurements of binding affinity demonstrating that NK-containing TAL effectors have less affinity for targets with G than their NN-containing counterparts. On targets for which G was substituted with A, higher G-specificity was observed for NK-containing TALENs. TALENs with different N- and C-terminal truncations were also tested on targets that differed in the length of the spacer between the two TALEN binding sites. TALENs with C-termini of either 63 or 231 amino acids after the repeat array cleaved targets across a broad range of spacer lengths - from 14 to 33 bp. TALENs with only 18 aa after the repeat array, however, showed a clear optimum for spacers of 13 to 16 bp. The data presented here provide useful guidelines for increasing the specificity and activity of engineered TAL effector proteins. © 2012 Christian et al.",,"amino acid; arginine nucleotide; guanine nucleotide; nuclease; nucleotide; transcription activator like effector; transcription activator like effector nuclease; transcription factor; tyrosine nucleotide; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; article; binding affinity; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; DNA cleavage; DNA structure; enzyme activity; enzyme specificity; fungal genetics; gene construct; gene targeting; genetic recombination; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; intermethod comparison; NK repeat variable di residue; NN repeat variable di residue; nonhuman; protein DNA interaction; protein engineering; repeat variable di residue; yeast; Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Cell Line; DNA-Binding Proteins; Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; Gene Targeting; Humans; Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid; Trans-Activators",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; nuclease, 9026-81-7; DNA-Binding Proteins; Trans-Activators",,,,"Bogdanove, A.J., Voytas, D.F., TAL effectors: customizable proteins for DNA targeting (2011) Science, 333, pp. 1843-1846; Bogdanove, A.J., Schornack, S., Lahaye, T., TAL effectors: finding plant genes for disease and defense (2010) Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 13, pp. 394-401; Mak, A.N., Bradley, P., Cernadas, R.A., Bogdanove, A.J., Stoddard, B.L., The crystal structure of TAL effector PthXo1 bound to its DNA target (2012) Science, 335, pp. 716-719; Deng, D., Yan, C., Pan, X., Mahfouz, M., Wang, J., Structural basis for sequence-specific recognition of DNA by TAL effectors (2012) Science, 335, pp. 720-723; Boch, J., Bonas, U., Xanthomonas AvrBs3 family-type III effectors: discovery and function (2010) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 48, pp. 419-436; Mahfouz, M.M., Li, L., Shamimuzzaman, M., Wibowo, A., Fang, X., De novo-engineered transcription activator-like effector (TALE) hybrid nuclease with novel DNA binding specificity creates double-strand breaks (2011) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A; Miller, J.C., Tan, S., Qiao, G., Barlow, K.A., Wang, J., A TALE nuclease architecture for efficient genome editing (2011) Nature Biotechnology, 29, pp. 143-148; Huang, P., Xiao, A., Zhou, M., Zhu, Z., Lin, S., Heritable gene targeting in zebrafish using customized TALENs (2011) Nature Biotechnology, 29, pp. 699-700; Cong, L., Zhou, R., Kuo, Y.C., Cunniff, M., Zhang, F., Comprehensive interrogation of natural TALE DNA-binding modules and transcriptional repressor domains (2012) Nature Communications, 3, p. 968; Streubel, J., Blucher, C., Landgraf, A., Boch, J., TAL effector RVD specificities and efficiencies (2012) Nature Biotechnology, 30, pp. 593-595; Christian, M., Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Schmidt, C., Zhang, F., Targeting DNA double-strand breaks with TAL effector nucleases (2010) Genetics, 186, pp. 757-761; Mussolino, C., Morbitzer, R., Lutge, F., Dannemann, N., Lahaye, T., A novel TALE nuclease scaffold enables high genome editing activity in combination with low toxicity (2011) Nucleic Acids Research, 39, pp. 9283-9293; Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Christian, M., Wang, L., Zhang, Y., Efficient design and assembly of custom TALEN and other TAL effector-based constructs for DNA targeting (2011) Nucleic Acids Research, 39, pp. e82; Townsend, J.A., Wright, D.A., Winfrey, R.J., Fu, F., Maeder, M.L., High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 442-445; Leaver-Fay, A., Tyka, M., Lewis, S.M., Lange, O.F., Thompson, J., ROSETTA3: an object-oriented software suite for the simulation and design of macromolecules (2011) Methods in Enzymology, 487, pp. 545-574; Boch, J., Scholze, H., Schornack, S., Landgraf, A., Hahn, S., Breaking the code of DNA binding specificity of TAL-type III effectors (2009) Science, 326, pp. 1509-1512; Zhang, F., Cong, L., Lodato, S., Kosuri, S., Church, G.M., Efficient construction of sequence-specific TAL effectors for modulating mammalian transcription (2011) Nature Biotechnology, 29, pp. 149-153; Sun, N., Liang, J., Abil, Z., Zhao, H., Optimized TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) for use in treatment of sickle cell disease (2012) Molecular BioSystems, 8, pp. 1255-1263; Bibikova, M., Carroll, D., Segal, D.J., Trautman, J.K., Smith, J., Stimulation of homologous recombination through targeted cleavage by chimeric nucleases (2001) Molecular and Cellular Biology, 21, pp. 289-297","Voytas, D.

Nevertheless, studies in the zebrafish have been limited by the approaches available for eliminating gene function. Here we present simple and efficient methods for inducing, detecting, and recovering mutations at virtually any locus in the zebrafish. Briefly, double-strand DNA breaks are induced at a locus of interest by synthetic nucleases, called TALENs. Subsequent host repair of the DNA lesions leads to the generation of insertion and deletion mutations at the targeted locus. To detect the induced DNA sequence alterations at targeted loci, genomes are examined using High Resolution Melt Analysis, an efficient and sensitive method for detecting the presence of newly arising sequence polymorphisms. As the DNA binding specificity of a TALEN is determined by a custom designed array of DNA recognition modules, each of which interacts with a single target nucleotide, TALENs with very high target sequence specificities can be easily generated. Using freely accessible reagents and Web-based software, and a very simple cloning strategy, a TALEN that uniquely recognizes a specific pre-determined locus in the zebrafish genome can be generated within days. Here we develop and test the activity of four TALENs directed at different target genes. Using the experimental approach described here, every embryo injected with RNA encoding a TALEN will acquire targeted mutations. Multiple independently arising mutations are produced in each growing embryo, and up to 50% of the host genomes may acquire a targeted mutation. Upon reaching adulthood, approximately 90% of these animals transmit targeted mutations to their progeny. Results presented here indicate the TALENs are highly sequence-specific and produce minimal off-target effects. In all, it takes about two weeks to create a target-specific TALEN and generate growing embryos that harbor an array of germ line mutations at a pre-specified locus. © 2012 Dahlem et al.",,"nuclease;

Repeats are polymorphic and individually specify single nucleotides in the DNA target, with some degeneracy. A TAL effector-nucleotide binding code that links repeat type to specified nucleotide enables prediction of genomic binding sites for TAL effectors and customization of TAL effectors for use in DNA targeting, in particular as custom transcription factors for engineered gene regulation and as site-specific nucleases for genome editing. We have developed a suite of web-based tools called TAL Effector-Nucleotide Targeter 2.0 (TALE-NT 2.0; https://boglab.plp.iastate.edu/) that enables design of custom TAL effector repeat arrays for desired targets and prediction of TAL effector binding sites, ranked by likelihood, in a genome, promoterome or other sequence of interest. Search parameters can be set by the user to work with any TAL effector or TAL effector nuclease architecture. Applications range from designing highly specific DNA targeting tools and identifying potential off-target sites to predicting effector targets important in plant disease. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"bacterial protein; nuclease; nucleotide; transcription activator like effector; transcription factor; unclassified drug; article; binding site; computer interface; computer program; controlled study; DNA sequence; gene control; gene targeting; genetic engineering; genome editing; human; Internet; nonhuman; nucleotide binding site; nucleotide repeat; plant disease; prediction; priority journal; promoter region; promoterome; Algorithms; Binding Sites; DNA; DNA-Binding Proteins; Internet; Protein Engineering; Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Trans-Activators; User-Computer Interface",,"nuclease, 9026-81-7; DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA-Binding Proteins; Trans-Activators","TALE-NT 2.0",,,"Bogdanove, A.J., Schornack, S., Lahaye, T., TAL effectors: Finding plant genes for disease and defense (2010) Curr.

Targeting is likely due to interactions between the Ty1 integration complex and a feature of chromatin characteristic of sites of Pol III transcription. To better understand Ty1 targeting determinants, >150,000 Ty1 insertions were mapped onto the S. cerevisiae genome sequence. Logistic regression was used to assess relationships between patterns of Ty1 integration and various genomic features, including genome-wide data sets of histone modifications and transcription-factor binding sites. Nucleosomes were positively associated with Ty1 insertions, and fine-scale mapping of insertions upstream of genes transcribed by Pol III indicated that Ty1 preferentially integrates into nucleosome-bound DNA near the H2A/H2B interface. Outside of genes transcribed by Pol III, Ty1 avoids coding sequences, a pattern that is not due to selection, but rather reflects a preference for nucleosome-rich sites flanking genes. Ty1 insertion sites were also mapped in four mutant lines that affect Ty1 transposition frequency or integration specificity (rrm3Δ, hos2Δ, rtt109Δ, and rad6Δ). Patterns of integration were largely preserved in the mutants, although significantly more insertions into coding sequences were observed in the rad6Δ strain, suggesting a loosening of target specificity in this mutant that lacks an enzyme involved in ubiquitinating H2A. Overall, our data suggest that nucleosomes are necessary for Ty1 integration, and that a secondary factor, likely a histone modification or nucleosome-bound factor enriched at sites of Pol III transcription, determines preferred target sites. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",,"DNA directed RNA polymerase III;

The Saccharomyces retrotransposon Ty5 preferentially integrates into heterochromatin because of interactions between Ty5 integrase and the heterochromatin protein silent information regulator 4. We mapped over 14,000 Ty5 insertions onto the S. cerevisiae genome, 76% of which occurred in heterochromatin, which is consistent with the known target site bias of Ty5. Using logistic regression, associations were assessed between Ty5 insertions and various chromosomal features such as genome-wide distributions of nucleosomes and histone modifications. Sites of Ty5 insertion, regardless of whether they occurred in heterochromatin or euchromatin, were strongly associated with DNase hypersensitive, nucleosome-free regions flanking genes. Our data support a model wherein silent information regulator 4 tethers the Ty5 integration machinery to domains of heterochromatin, and then, specific target sites are selected based on DNA access, resulting in a secondary target site bias. For insertions in euchromatin, DNA access is the primary determinant of target site choice. One consequence of the secondary target site bias of Ty5 is that insertions in coding sequences occur infrequently, which may preserve genome integrity.",,"deoxyribonuclease; fungal DNA; genomic DNA;

Progress has been made in engineering DNA binding domains to direct proteins to particular sequences for mutagenesis or manipulation of transcription; however, achieving the requisite specificities has been challenging. Transcription activator - like (TAL) effectors of plant pathogenic bacteria contain a modular DNA binding domain that appears to overcome this challenge. Comprising tandem, polymorphic amino acid repeats that individually specify contiguous nucleotides in DNA, this domain is being deployed in DNA targeting for applications ranging from understanding gene function in model organisms to improving traits in crop plants to treating genetic disorders in people.",,"amino acid; chemokine receptor CCR2; chemokine receptor CCR5; DNA binding protein; hybrid protein; messenger RNA; nuclease; protein VP16; repeat variable diresidue; transcription activator like effector; transcription activator like effector nuclease; transcription factor; unclassified drug; zinc finger nuclease; zinc finger protein; amino acid; bacterium; chemical binding; crop plant; genomics; protein; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; bacterial colonization; binding site; Caenorhabditis elegans; chromosome; DNA binding; DNA cleavage; DNA polymorphism; DNA sequence; DNA structure; double stranded DNA break; embryonic stem cell; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene targeting; homologous recombination; human; nonhuman; plant cell; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; promoter region; protein domain; protein engineering; review; site directed mutagenesis; transcription initiation; Xanthomonas; yeast; zebra fish",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; nuclease, 9026-81-7",,,,"Urnov, F.D., Rebar, E.J., (2002) Biochem.

Targeted double-stranded breaks due to custom restriction enzymes are powerful nucleating events for the induction of local changes in the genome. The zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) platform established the potential of this approach for the zebrafish, but access to high quality reagents has been a major bottleneck for the field. However, two groups recently report successful somatic and germline gene modification using a new nuclease architecture, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). TALEN construction is simpler, potentially more reliable, and in the few cases examined, shows fewer off-target effects than corresponding ZFNs. TALENs promise to bring gene targeting to the majority of zebrafish laboratories. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.",,"deoxyribonuclease; animal; gene targeting; genetics; genomics; metabolism; methodology; mutation; review; zebra fish; Animals; Deoxyribonucleases; Gene Targeting; Genomics; Mutation; Zebrafish; Danio rerio",,"deoxyribonuclease, 37211-67-9; Deoxyribonucleases, 3.1.-",,,,"Doyon, Y., McCammon, J.M., Miller, J.C., Faraji, F., Ngo, C., Katibah, G.E., Amora, R., Amacher, S.L., Heritable targeted gene disruption in zebrafish using designed zinc-finger nucleases (2008) Nature Biotechnology, 26 (6), pp. 702-708. , DOI 10.1038/nbt1409, PII NBT1409; Meng, X., Noyes, M.B., Zhu, L.J., Lawson, N.D., Wolfe, S.A., Targeted gene inactivation in zebrafish using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (2008) Nature Biotechnology, 26 (6), pp. 695-701. , DOI 10.1038/nbt1398, PII NBT1398; Foley, J.E., Yeh, J.R., Maeder, M.L., Reyon, D., Sander, J.D., Peterson, R.T., Rapid mutation of endogenous zebrafish genes using zinc finger nucleases made by Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) (2009) PLoS One, 4, pp. e4348; Lawson, N.D., Wolfe, S.A., Forward and reverse genetic approaches for the analysis of vertebrate development in the zebrafish (2011) Dev Cell, 21, pp. 48-64; Moscou, M.J., Bogdanove, A.J., A simple cipher governs DNA recognition by TAL effectors (2009) Science (New York, NY), 326, p. 1501; Boch, J., Scholze, H., Schornack, S., Landgraf, A., Hahn, S., Kay, S., Breaking the code of DNA binding specificity of TAL-type III effectors (2009) Science (New York, NY), 326, pp. 1509-1512; Sander, J.D., Cade, L., Khayter, C., Reyon, D., Peterson, R.T., Joung, J.K., Targeted gene disruption in somatic zebrafish cells using engineered TALENs (2011) Nat Biotechnol, 29, pp. 697-698; Huang, P., Xiao, A., Zhou, M., Zhu, Z., Lin, S., Zhang, B., Heritable gene targeting in zebrafish using customized TALENs (2011) Nat Biotechnol, 29, pp. 699-700; Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Christian, M., Wang, L., Zhang, Y., Schmidt, C., Efficient design and assembly of custom TALEN and other TAL effector-based constructs for DNA targeting (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, 39, pp. e82; Zhang, F., Cong, L., Lodato, S., Kosuri, S., Church, G.M., Arlotta, P., Efficient construction of sequence-specific TAL effectors for modulating mammalian transcription (2011) Nat Biotechnol, 29, pp. 149-153; Morbitzer, R., Elsaesser, J., Hausner, J., Lahaye, T., Assembly of custom TALE-type DNA binding domains by modular cloning (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, 39, pp. 5790-5799; Li, T., Huang, S., Zhao, X., Wright, D.A., Carpenter, S., Spalding, M.H., Modularly assembled designer TAL effector nucleases for targeted gene knockout and gene replacement in eukaryotes (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, 39, pp. 6315-6325; Gabriel, R., Lombardo, A., Arens, A., Miller, J.C., Genovese, P., Kaeppel, C., An unbiased genome-wide analysis of zincfinger nuclease specificity (2011) Nat Biotechnol, , Epub ahead of print; DOI: 10.1038/nbt.1948; Gupta, A., Meng, X., Zhu, L.J., Lawson, N.D., Wolfe, S.A., Zinc finger protein-dependent and-independent contributions to the in vivo off-target activity of zinc finger nucleases (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, 39, pp. 381-392; Pattanayak, V., Ramirez, C.L., Joung, J.K., Liu, D.R., Revealing offtarget cleavage specificities of zinc-finger nucleases by in vitro selection (2011) Nat Methods, , Epub ahead of print; DOI: 10.1038/nmeth; Hockemeyer, D., Wang, H., Kiani, S., Lai, C.S., Gao, Q., Cassady, J.P., Genetic engineering of human pluripotent cells using TALE nucleases (2011) Nat Biotechnol, 29, pp. 731-734; Mussolino, C., Morbitzer, R., Lutge, F., Dannemann, N., Lahaye, T., Cathomen, T., A novel TALE nuclease scaffold enables high genome editing activity in combination with low toxicity (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, , Epub ahead of print; DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkr597","Ekker, S.C.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Addiction Research Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, United States; email: ekker.stephen@mayo.edu",,,,,,,,15458547,,,21929364,"English","Zebrafish",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053022290

Fusions of transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors of plant pathogenic Xanthomonas spp. to the FokI nuclease, TALENs bind and cleave DNA in pairs. Binding specificity is determined by customizable arrays of polymorphic amino acid repeats in the TAL effectors. We present a method and reagents for efficiently assembling TALEN constructs with custom repeat arrays. We also describe design guidelines based on naturally occurring TAL effectors and their binding sites. Using software that applies these guidelines, in nine genes from plants, animals and protists, we found candidate cleavage sites on average every 35bp. Each of 15 sites selected from this set was cleaved in a yeast-based assay with TALEN pairs constructed with our reagents. We used two of the TALEN pairs to mutate HPRT1 in human cells and ADH1 in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. Our reagents include a plasmid construct for making custom TAL effectors and one for TAL effector fusions to additional proteins of interest. Using the former, we constructed de novo a functional analog of AvrHah1 of Xanthomonas gardneri. The complete plasmid set is available through the non-profit repository AddGene and a web-based version of our software is freely accessible online. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"DNA binding protein; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; transcription activator like effector; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis; article; binding site; controlled study; data analysis software; DNA binding; DNA cleavage; gene construct; gene frequency; gene targeting; genetic engineering; human; human cell; molecular cloning; mutagenesis; nonhuman; plant genetics; plasmid; priority journal; protein assembly; protein expression; protein function; protoplast; stop codon; Xanthomonas; Xanthomonas gardneri; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific; DNA Cleavage; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Targeting; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; Protein Engineering; Protoplasts; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid; Software; Trans-Activators; Xanthomonas; Animalia; Arabidopsis thaliana; Protista; Xanthomonas; Xanthomonas gardneri",,"hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, 9016-12-0; DNA-Binding Proteins; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific, 3.1.21.4; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Trans-Activators; endodeoxyribonuclease FokI, 3.1.21.-",,,,"Bogdanove, A.J., Schornack, S., Lahaye, T., TAL effectors: Finding plant genes for disease and defense (2010) Curr.

A suite of ZFNs were engineered by the recently described context-dependent assembly platform-a rapid, open-source method for generating zinc-finger arrays. Specific ZFNs targeting DICER-LIKE (DCL) genes and other genes involved in RNA silencing were cloned into a vector under an estrogen-inducible promoter. A hairy-root transformation system was employed to investigate the efficiency of ZFN mutagenesis at each target locus. Transgenic roots exhibited somatic mutations localized at the ZFN target sites for seven out of nine targeted genes. We next introduced a ZFN into soybean via whole-plant transformation and generated independent mutations in the paralogous genes DCL4a and DCL4b. The dcl4b mutation showed efficient heritable transmission of the ZFN-induced mutation in the subsequent generation. These findings indicate that ZFN-based mutagenesis provides an efficient method for making mutations in duplicate genes that are otherwise difficult to study due to redundancy. We also developed a publicly accessible Web-based tool to identify sites suitable for engineering context-dependent assembly ZFNs in the soybean genome.© 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"endonuclease; green fluorescent protein; zinc finger protein; article; chemistry; duplicate gene; genetic procedures; genetics; inheritance; Internet; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutagenesis; mutation; nucleotide sequence; plant gene; plant root; polymerase chain reaction; soybean; transgene; Base Sequence; Endonucleases; Genes, Duplicate; Genes, Plant; Genetic Techniques; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Inheritance Patterns; Internet; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Plant Roots; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Soybeans; Transgenes; Zinc Fingers; Glycine max","GENBANK: AF309825","endonuclease, 9055-11-2; Endonucleases, 3.1.-; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9",,,,"Blanc, G., Wolfe, K.H., Widespread paleopolyploidy in model plant species inferred from age distributions of duplicate genes (2004) Plant Cell, 16, pp. 1667-1678; Christian, M., Cermak, T., Doyle, E.L., Schmidt, C., Zhang, F., Hummel, A., Bogdanove, A.J., Voytas, D.F., Targeting DNA double-strand breaks with TAL effector nucleases (2010) Genetics, 186, pp. 757-761; Cooper, J.L., Till, B.J., Laport, R.G., Darlow, M.C., Kleffner, J.M., Jamai, A., El-Mellouki, T., Nielsen, N., TILLING to detect induced mutations in soybean (2008) BMC Plant Biol, 8, p. 9; Curtin, S.J., Watson, J.M., Smith, N.A., Eamens, A.L., Blanchard, C.L., Waterhouse, P.M., The roles of plant dsRNA-binding proteins in RNAi-like pathways (2008) FEBS Lett, 582, pp. 2753-2760; Fusaro, A.F., Matthew, L., Smith, N.A., Curtin, S.J., Dedic-Hagan, J., Ellacott, G.A., Watson, J.M., Carroll, B.J., RNA interference-inducing hairpin RNAs in plants act through the viral defence pathway (2006) EMBO Rep, 7, pp. 1168-1175; Fu, F., Sander, J.D., Maeder, M., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Joung, J.K., Dobbs, D., Miller, L., Voytas, D.F., Zinc Finger Database (ZiFDB): A repository for information on C2H2 zinc fingers and engineered zinc-finger arrays (2009) Nucleic Acids Res (Database Issue), 37, pp. D279-D283; Govindarajulu, M., Elmore, J.M., Fester, T., Taylor, C.G., Evaluation of constitutive viral promoters in transgenic soybean roots and nodules (2008) Mol Plant Microbe Interact, 21, pp. 1027-1035; Händel, E.M., Alwin, S., Cathomen, T., Expanding or restricting the target site repertoire of zinc-finger nucleases: The inter-domain linker as a major determinant of target site selectivity (2009) Mol Ther, 17, pp. 104-111; Hernandez-Garcia, C.M., Martinelli, A.P., Bouchard, R.A., Finer, J.J., A soybean (Glycine max) polyubiquitin promoter gives strong constitutive expression in transgenic soybean (2009) Plant Cell Rep, 28, pp. 837-849; Hyten, D.L., Song, Q., Zhu, Y., Choi, I.Y., Nelson, R.L., Costa, J.M., Specht, J.E., Cregan, P.B., Impacts of genetic bottlenecks on soybean genome diversity (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 16666-16671; Joung, J.K., Voytas, D.F., Cathomen, T., Reply to ''Genome editing with modularly assembled zinc-finger nucleases (2010) Nat Methods, 7, pp. 91-92; Kachroo, A., Fu, D.Q., Havens, W., Navarre, D., Kachroo, P., Ghabrial, S.A., An oleic acid-mediated pathway induces constitutive defense signaling and enhanced resistance to multiple pathogens in soybean (2008) Mol Plant Microbe Interact, 21, pp. 564-575; Kim, J.S., Lee, H.J., Carroll, D., Genome editing with modularly assembled zinc-finger nucleases (2010) Nat Methods, 7, p. 91; Li, T., Huang, S., Jiang, W.Z., Wright, D., Spalding, M.H., Weeks, D.P., Yang, B., TAL nucleases (TALNs): Hybrid proteins composed of TAL effectors and FokI DNA-cleavage domain (2011) Nucleic Acids Res, 39, pp. 359-372; Maeder, M.L., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Osiak, A., Wright, D.A., Anthony, R.M., Eichtinger, M., Jiang, T., Townsend, J.A., Rapid ''open-source'' engineering of customized zinc-finger nucleases for highly efficient gene modification (2008) Mol Cell, 31, pp. 294-301; Maeder, M.L., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Sander, J.D., Voytas, D.F., Joung, J.K., Oligomerized pool engineering (OPEN): An 'open-source' protocol for making customized zinc-finger arrays (2009) Nat Protoc, 4, pp. 1471-1501; Margis, R., Fusaro, A.F., Smith, N.A., Curtin, S.J., Watson, J.M., Finnegan, E.J., Waterhouse, P.M., The evolution and diversification of Dicers in plants (2006) FEBS Lett, 580, pp. 2442-2450; Mathieu, M., Winters, E.K., Kong, F., Wan, J., Wang, S., Eckert, H., Luth, D., Zhang, Z., Establishment of a soybean (Glycine max Merr.

In this protocol, constructs encoding ZFNs for specific loci are transformed into Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. ZFN expression is induced during germination to initiate mutagenesis of the target locus. Typically, more than 20% of the primary transgenics segregate loss-of-function mutations in the next generation.

ZFNs can be used to advance both basic research and clinical applications, including gene therapy. Recently, the ability to engineer ZFNs that target any desired genomic DNA sequence with high fidelity has improved significantly with the introduction of rapid, robust, and publicly available techniques for ZFN design such as the Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) method. The motivation for this study is to make resources for genome modifications using OPEN-generated ZFNs more accessible to researchers by creating a user-friendly interface that identifies and provides quality scores for all potential ZFN target sites in the complete genomes of several model organisms.Description: ZFNGenome is a GBrowse-based tool for identifying and visualizing potential target sites for OPEN-generated ZFNs. ZFNGenome currently includes a total of more than 11.6 million potential ZFN target sites, mapped within the fully sequenced genomes of seven model organisms; S. cerevisiae, C. reinhardtii, A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, D. rerio, C. elegans, and H. sapiens and can be visualized within the flexible GBrowse environment. Additional model organisms will be included in future updates. ZFNGenome provides information about each potential ZFN target site, including its chromosomal location and position relative to transcription initiation site(s). Users can query ZFNGenome using several different criteria (e.g., gene ID, transcript ID, target site sequence). Tracks in ZFNGenome also provide ""uniqueness"" and ZiFOpT (Zinc Finger OPEN Targeter) ""confidence"" scores that estimate the likelihood that a chosen ZFN target site will function in vivo. ZFNGenome is dynamically linked to ZiFDB, allowing users access to all available information about zinc finger reagents, such as the effectiveness of a given ZFN in creating double-stranded breaks.Conclusions: ZFNGenome provides a user-friendly interface that allows researchers to access resources and information regarding genomic target sites for engineered ZFNs in seven model organisms. This genome-wide database of potential ZFN target sites should greatly facilitate the utilization of ZFNs in both basic and clinical research.ZFNGenome is freely available at: http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/ZFNGenome or at the Zinc Finger Consortium website: http://www.zincfingers.org/. © 2011 Reyon et al;

The talks were organized into eight scientific sessions, which ranged in topic from the evolutionary dynamics of mobile genetic elements to transposition reaction mechanisms. Here we present highlights from the platform sessions with a focus on talks presented by the invited speakers. © 2010 Chaconas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,,,,,,,"Voytas, D.F.; Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States; email: voytas@umn.edu",,,,,,,,17598753,,,,"English","Mob.

Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) hold much promise for overcoming this limitation: they can be used to generate targeted gene knockouts through imprecise repair of broken chromosomes by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or they can stimulate the introduction of specific DNA sequence changes through homologous recombination. Critical to the function of ZFNs is their ability to access and cleave chromosomal target sites. Numerous factors may obscure cleavage, including packaging of DNA into chromatin, DNA methylation, or the presence of other proteins at the target site. Here we describe a transient assay that rapidly assesses ZFN function at chromosomal targets in plant cells. The assay monitors the ability of a ZFN to introduce mutations by imprecise repair through NHEJ, resulting in the loss of a restriction endonuclease recognition sequence. The requirement for the restriction endonuclease recognition sequence coincident with the ZFN spacer region has thus far not been a limiting factor in identifying ZFN target sites in genes of interest suitable for this assay. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Arabidopsis; mutagenesis; non-homologous end joining; Plant transformation","Arabidopsis; endonuclease; zinc finger protein; Arabidopsis; article; genetic transformation; genetics; metabolism; plant; plant gene; polymerase chain reaction; Arabidopsis; Endonucleases; Genes, Plant; Plants; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transformation, Genetic; Zinc Fingers",,"endonuclease, 9055-11-2; Endonucleases, 3.1.-",,,,"Hurt, J.A., Thibodeau, S.A., Hirsh, A.S., Pabo, C.O., Joung, J.K., Highly specific zinc finger proteins obtained by directed domain shuffling and cell-based selection (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA., 100, pp. 12271-12276; Carroll, D., Morton, J.J., Beumer, K.J., Segal, D.J., Design, construction and in vitro testing of zinc finger nucleases (2006) Nat Protoc., 1, pp. 1329-1341; Doyon, Y., McCammon, J.M., Miller, J.C., Faraji, F., Ngo, C., Katibah, G.E., Amora, R., Rebar, E.J., Heritable targeted gene disruption in zebrafish using designed zinc-finger nucleases (2008) Nat Biotechnol., 26, pp. 702-708; Townsend, J., Wright, D.A., Winfrey, R.J., Fu, F., Maeder, M., Joung, J.K., Voytas, D.F., High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc finger nucleases (2009) Nature., 495, pp. 442-445; Lloyd, A., Plaisier, C.L., Carroll, D., Drews, G.N., Targeted mutagenesis using zinc-finger nucleases in Arabidopsis (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA., 102, pp. 2232-2237; Yoo, S.D., Cho, Y.H., Sheen, J., Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts: A versatile cell system for transient gene expression analysis (2007) Nat Protoc., 2, pp. 1565-1572","Hoshaw, J.P.; Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, Center for Genome Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States","Mackay J.P.Segal D.J.",,,,,,,10643745,9781607617525,,20680843,"English","Methods Mol.

Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) is a recently developed method for engineering C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) designed to bind specific DNA sequences with high affinity and specificity in vivo. Because generation of ZFPs using OPEN requires considerable effort, a computational method for identifying the sites in any given gene that are most likely to be successfully targeted by this method is desirable.Results: Analysis of the base composition of experimentally validated ZFP target sites identified important constraints on the DNA sequence space that can be effectively targeted using OPEN. Using alternate encodings to represent ZFP target sites, we implemented Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers capable of distinguishing ""active"" targets, i.e., ZFP binding sites that can be targeted with a high rate of success, from those that are ""inactive"" or poor targets for ZFPs generated using current OPEN technologies. When evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation on a dataset of 135 experimentally validated ZFP target sites, the best Naïve Bayes classifier, designated ZiFOpT, achieved overall accuracy of 87% and specificity+of 90%, with an ROC AUC of 0.89. When challenged with a completely independent test set of 140 newly validated ZFP target sites, ZiFOpT performance was comparable in terms of overall accuracy (88%) and specificity+(92%), but with reduced ROC AUC (0.77). Users can rank potentially active ZFP target sites using a confidence score derived from the posterior probability returned by ZiFOpT.Conclusion: ZiFOpT, a machine learning classifier trained to identify DNA sequences amenable for targeting by OPEN-generated zinc finger arrays, can guide users to target sites that are most likely to function successfully in vivo, substantially reducing the experimental effort required. ZiFOpT is freely available and incorporated in the Zinc Finger Targeter web server (http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/ZiFiT). © 2010 Sander et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"C2h2 zinc finger proteins; Confidence score; Learning classifiers; Leave-one-out cross validations; Overall accuracies; Posterior probability; Regulatory network; Support vector machine classifiers; DNA sequences; Lakes; Oligomers; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Zinc; DNA binding protein; zinc finger protein; article; artificial intelligence; binding site; chemistry; DNA sequence; gene targeting; genetics; methodology; nucleotide sequence; protein engineering; Artificial Intelligence; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Targeting; Protein Engineering; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Zinc Fingers",,"DNA-Binding Proteins",,,,"Carroll, D., Progress and prospects: zinc-finger nucleases as gene therapy agents (2008) Gene Ther, 15 (22), pp. 1463-1468. , 10.1038/gt.2008.145, 2747807, 18784746; Cathomen, T., Keith Joung, J., Zinc-finger nucleases: the next generation emerges (2008) Mol Ther, 16 (7), pp. 1200-1207. , 10.1038/mt.2008.114, 18545224; Urnov, F.D., Rebar, E.J., Holmes, M.C., Zhang, H.S., Gregory, P.D., Genome editing with engineered zinc finger nucleases (2010) Nat Rev Genet, 11 (9), pp. 636-646. , 10.1038/nrg2842, 20717154; Morton, J., Davis, M.W., Jorgensen, E.M., Carroll, D., Induction and repair of zinc-finger nuclease-targeted double-strand breaks in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cells (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103 (44), pp. 16370-16375. , 10.1073/pnas.0605633103, 1637589, 17060623; Santiago, Y., Chan, E., Liu, P.Q., Orlando, S., Zhang, L., Urnov, F.D., Holmes, M.C., Collingwood, T.N., Targeted gene knockout in mammalian cells by using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105 (15), pp. 5809-5814. , 10.1073/pnas.0800940105, 2299223, 18359850; Beumer, K., Bhattacharyya, G., Bibikova, M., Trautman, J.K., Carroll, D., Efficient gene targeting in Drosophila with zinc-finger nucleases (2006) Genetics, 172 (4), pp. 2391-2403. , 10.1534/genetics.105.052829, 1456366, 16452139; Doyon, Y., McCammon, J.M., Miller, J.C., Faraji, F., Ngo, C., Katibah, G.E., Amora, R., Amacher, S.L., Heritable targeted gene disruption in zebrafish using designed zinc-finger nucleases (2008) Nat Biotechnol, 26 (6), pp. 702-708. , 10.1038/nbt1409, 2674762, 18500334; Maeder, M.L., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Osiak, A., Wright, D.A., Anthony, R.M., Eichtinger, M., Jiang, T., Joung, J.K., Rapid ""open-source"" engineering of customized zinc-finger nucleases for highly efficient gene modification (2008) Mol Cell, 31 (2), pp. 294-301. , 10.1016/j.molcel.2008.06.016, 2535758, 18657511; Foley, J.E., Yeh, J.R., Maeder, M.L., Reyon, D., Sander, J.D., Peterson, R.T., Joung, J.K., Rapid mutation of endogenous zebrafish genes using zinc finger nucleases made by Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) (2009) PLoS ONE, 4 (2), pp. e4348. , 10.1371/journal.pone.0004348, 2634973, 19198653; Townsend, J.A., Wright, D.A., Winfrey, R.J., Fu, F., Maeder, M., Joung, J.K., Voytas, D.F., High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Nature, 459 (7245), pp. 442-445. , 2743854, 19404258; Lee, H.J., Kim, E., Kim, J.S., Targeted chromosomal deletions in human cells using zinc finger nucleases (2009) Genome Res, 20 (1), pp. 81-89. , 10.1101/gr.099747.109, 2798833, 19952142; Shukla, V.K., Doyon, Y., Miller, J.C., DeKelver, R.C., Moehle, E.A., Worden, S.E., Mitchell, J.C., Urnov, F.D., Precise genome modification in the crop species Zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Nature, 459 (7245), pp. 437-441. , 10.1038/nature07992, 19404259; Voigt, B., Serikawa, T., Pluripotent stem cells and other technologies will eventually open the door for straightforward gene targeting in the rat (2009) Dis Model Mech, 2 (7-8), pp. 341-343. , 10.1242/dmm.002824, 19553695; Geurts, A.M., Cost, G.J., Freyvert, Y., Zeitler, B., Miller, J.C., Choi, V.M., Jenkins, S.S., Buelow, R., Knockout rats via embryo microinjection of zinc-finger nucleases (2009) Science, 325 (5939), p. 433. , 10.1126/science.1172447, 2831805, 19628861; Zou, J., Maeder, M.L., Mali, P., Pruett-Miller, S.M., Thibodeau-Beganny, S., Chou, B.K., Chen, G., Cheng, L., Gene targeting of a disease-related gene in human induced pluripotent stem and embryonic stem cells (2009) Cell Stem Cell, 5 (1), pp. 97-110. , 10.1016/j.stem.2009.05.023, 2720132, 19540188; Scott, C.T., The zinc finger nuclease monopoly (2005) Nat Biotechnol, 23 (8), pp. 915-918. , 10.1038/nbt0805-915, 16082353; Kaiser, J., Gene therapy.

Retrotransposons are abundant components of plant genomes, and although some plant retrotransposons have been used as insertional mutagens, these mobile genetic elements have not been widely exploited for plant genome manipulation. In vertebrates and yeast, retrotransposons and retroviruses are routinely altered to carry additional genes that are copied into complementary (c)DNA through reverse transcription. Integration of cDNA results in gene delivery; recombination of cDNA with homologous chromosomal sequences can create targeted gene modifications. Plant retrotransposon-based vectors, therefore, may provide new opportunities for plant genome engineering. Results. A retrotransposon vector system was developed for gene delivery in plants based on the Tnt1 element from Nicotiana tabacum. Mini-Tnt1 transfer vectors were constructed that lack coding sequences yet retain the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats (LTRs) and adjacent cis sequences required for reverse transcription. The internal coding region of Tnt1 was replaced with a neomycin phosphotransferase gene to monitor replication by reverse transcription. Two different mini-Tnt1 s were developed: one with the native 5' LTR and the other with a chimeric 5' LTR that had the first 233 bp replaced by the CaMV 35 S promoter. After transfer into tobacco protoplasts, both vectors undergo retrotransposition using GAG and POL proteins provided in trans by endogenous Tnt1 elements. The transposition frequencies of mini-Tnt1 vectors are comparable with native Tnt1 elements, and like the native elements, insertion sites are within or near coding sequences. In this paper, we provide evidence that template switching occurs during mini-Tnt1 reverse transcription, indicating that multiple copies of Tnt1 mRNA are packaged into virus-like particles. Conclusions. Our data demonstrate that mini-Tnt1 vectors can replicate efficiently in tobacco cells using GAG and POL proteins provided in trans by native Tnt1 elements. This suggests that helper Tnt1 constructs can be developed to enable a Tnt1-based two-component vector system that could be used in other plant species. Such a vector system may prove useful for gene delivery or the production of cDNA that can serve as a donor molecule for gene modification through homologous recombination. © 2010 Hou et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"complementary DNA;

ZFNs recognizing the Arabidopsis ADH1 and TT4 genes were made by Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) - a publicly available, selection-based platform that yields high quality zinc finger arrays. The ADH1 and TT4 ZFNs were placed under control of an estrogen-inducible promoter and introduced into Arabidopsis plants by floral-dip transformation. Primary transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings induced to express the ADH1 or TT4 ZFNs exhibited somatic mutation frequencies of 7% or 16%, respectively. The induced mutations were typically insertions or deletions (1-142 bp) that were localized at the ZFN cleavage site and likely derived from imprecise repair of chromosome breaks by nonhomologous end-joining. Mutations were transmitted to the next generation for 69% of primary transgenics expressing the ADH1 ZFNs and 33% of transgenics expressing the TT4 ZFNs. Furthermore, ≈20% of the mutant-producing plants were homozygous for mutations at ADH1 or TT4, indicating that both alleles were disrupted. ADH1 and TT4 were chosen as targets for this study because of their selectable or screenable phenotypes (adh1, allyl alcohol resistance; tt4, lack of anthocyanins in the seed coat). However, the high frequency of observed ZFN-induced mutagenesis suggests that targeted mutations can readily be recovered by simply screening progeny of primary transgenic plants by PCR and DNA sequencing. Taken together, our results suggest that it should now be possible to obtain mutations in any Arabidopsis target gene regardless of its mutant phenotype.","Alcohol dehydrogenase; Chalcone synthase; Gene knockout;

Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs)enzymes engineered to create DNA double-strand breaks at specific lociare potent stimulators of gene targeting; for example, they can be used to precisely modify engineered reporter genes in plants. Here we demonstrate high-frequency ZFN-stimulated gene targeting at endogenous plant genes, namely the tobacco acetolactate synthase genes (ALS SuRA and SuRB), for which specific mutations are known to confer resistance to imidazolinone and sulphonylurea herbicides. Herbicide-resistance mutations were introduced into SuR loci by ZFN-mediated gene targeting at frequencies exceeding 2% of transformed cells for mutations as far as 1.3 kilobases from the ZFN cleavage site. More than 40% of recombinant plants had modifications in multiple SuR alleles. The observed high frequency of gene targeting indicates that it is now possible to efficiently make targeted sequence changes in endogenous plant genes. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"acetolactate synthase; enzyme; nuclease; plant DNA; unclassified drug; zinc finger nuclease; zinc finger protein; crop plant; DNA; enzyme; genetic analysis; herbicide; mutation; tobacco; allele; article; cell transformation; DNA binding; DNA cleavage; DNA modification; double stranded DNA break; gene mutation; gene sequence; gene targeting; genetic engineering; genetic recombination; herbicide resistance; nucleotide sequence; plant; plant genetics; priority journal; tobacco; Acetolactate Synthase; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Deoxyribonucleases; Food, Genetically Modified; Gene Targeting; Genes, Plant; Herbicide Resistance; Herbicides; Molecular Sequence Data; Plants, Genetically Modified; Protein Engineering; Recombination, Genetic; Tobacco; Transformation, Genetic; Zinc Fingers; Nicotiana tabacum","GENBANK: FJ649655, X07645","acetolactate synthase, 9027-45-6; nuclease, 9026-81-7; Acetolactate Synthase, 2.2.1.6; Deoxyribonucleases, 3.1.-; Herbicides",,,,"Bibikova, M., Beumer, K., Trautman, J.K., Carroll, D., Enhancing gene targeting with designed zinc finger nucleases (2003) Science, 300, p. 764; Porteus, M.H., Baltimore, D., Chimeric nucleases stimulate gene targeting in human cells (2003) Science, 300, p. 763; Lloyd, A., Plaisier, C.L., Carroll, D., Drews, G.N., Targeted mutagenesis using zinc-finger nucleases in Arabidopsis (2005) Proc.

Individual zinc-finger domains (ZFDs) bind specific DNA triplet sequences; their apparent modularity has led some groups to propose methods that allow virtually any desired DNA motif to be targeted in vitro. In practice, however, ZFPs engineered using this 'modular assembly' approach do not always function well in vivo. Here we report a modular assembly scoring strategy that both identifies combinations of modules least likely to function efficiently in vivo and provides accurate estimates of their relative binding affinities in vitro. Predicted binding affinities for 53 'three-finger' ZFPs, computed based on energy contributions of the constituent modules, were highly correlated (r = 0.80) with activity levels measured in bacterial two-hybrid assays. Moreover, Kd values for seven modularly assembled ZFPs and their intended targets, measured using fluorescence anisotropy, were also highly correlated with predictions (r = 0.91). We propose that success rates for ZFP modular assembly can be significantly improved by exploiting the score-based strategy described here. © 2008 The Author(s).",,"zinc finger protein; analytic method; anisotropy; article; binding affinity; controlled study; correlation analysis; DNA binding; fluorescence; prediction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein assembly; protein engineering; protein function; Binding Sites; DNA-Binding Proteins; Protein Binding; Protein Engineering; Zinc Fingers; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,"DNA-Binding Proteins",,,,"Durai, S., Mani, M., Kandavelou, K., Wu, J., Porteus, M.H., Chandrasegaran, S., Zinc finger nucleases: Custom-designed molecular scissors for genome engineering of plant and mammalian cells (2005) Nucleic Acids Res, 33, pp. 5978-5990; Klug, A., Towards therapeutic applications of engineered zinc ?nger proteins (2005) FEBS Lett, 579, pp. 892-894; Porteus, M.H., Carroll, D., Gene targeting using zinc finger nucleases (2005) Nat.

Each zinc finger typically binds a 3-nt target sequence, and it is possible to engineer zinc-finger arrays (ZFAs) that recognize extended DNA sequences by linking together individual zinc fingers. Engineered zinc-finger proteins have proven to be valuable tools for gene regulation and genome modification because they target specific sites in a genome. Here we describe ZiFDB (Zinc Finger Database; http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/ZiFDB), a web-accessible resource that compiles information on individual zinc fingers and engineered ZFAs. To enhance its utility, ZiFDB is linked to the output from ZiFiT - a software package that assists biologists in finding sites within target genes for engineering zinc-finger proteins. For many molecular biologists, ZiFDB will be particularly valuable for determining if a given ZFA (or portion thereof) has previously been constructed and whether or not it has the requisite DNA-binding activity for their experiments. ZiFDB will also be a valuable resource for those scientists interested in better understanding how zinc-finger proteins recognize target DNA. © 2008 The Author(s).",,"DNA binding protein; zinc finger protein; access to information; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; article; computer program; DNA binding; DNA modification; DNA sequence; eukaryote; gene control; gene targeting; genome analysis; Internet; molecular recognition; priority journal; protein binding; protein database; protein domain; protein engineering; protein function; protein motif; sequence analysis; Zinc Finger Database; Binding Sites; Databases, Protein; DNA; DNA-Binding Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Protein Engineering; Transcription Factors; User-Computer Interface; Zinc Fingers; Eukaryota",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA-Binding Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,"Wolfe, S., Nekludova, L., Pabo, C., DNA recognition by Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins (2000) Annu.

A bottleneck in the application of ZFN technology has been the generation of highly specific engineered zinc-finger arrays. Here we describe OPEN (Oligomerized Pool ENgineering), a rapid, publicly available strategy for constructing multifinger arrays, which we show is more effective than the previously published modular assembly method. We used OPEN to construct 37 highly active ZFN pairs which induced targeted alterations with high efficiencies (1%-50%) at 11 different target sites located within three endogenous human genes (VEGF-A, HoxB13, and CFTR), an endogenous plant gene (tobacco SuRA), and a chromosomally integrated EGFP reporter gene. In summary, OPEN provides an ""open-source"" method for rapidly engineering highly active zinc-finger arrays, thereby enabling broader practice, development, and application of ZFN technology for biological research and gene therapy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Increasingly, this specificity is found to result from recognition by the retroelement of specific chromatin states or DNA-bound protein complexes. A well-studied example of such a targeted retroelement is the Saccharomyces Ty5 retrotransposon, which integrates into heterochromatin at the telomeres and silent mating loci. Targeting is mediated by an interaction between Ty5 integrase (IN) and the heterochromatin protein silent information regulator 4 (Sir4). A small motif of IN, called the targeting domain, is responsible for this interaction. Ty5 integration can be directed to DNA sites outside of heterochromatin by tethering Sir4 to ectopic locations using fusion proteins between Sir4 and a DNA-binding domain. Alternatively, the targeting domain of Ty5 can be swapped with peptides that recognize other protein partners, thereby generating Ty5 elements with new target specificities. The mechanism of Ty5 target site choice suggests that integration specificity of other retrotransposons and retroviruses can be altered by engineering integrases to recognize DNA-bound protein partners. Retroelements can also be used to probe chromatin dynamics and the distribution of protein complexes on chromosomes. Here, we describe the basic assay by which Ty5 integration is monitored to sites of tethered Sir4.",,"fungal DNA; integrase; silent information regulator protein; SIR4 protein, S cerevisiae; unclassified drug; article; binding site; electroporation; Escherichia coli; genetic transformation; genetics; metabolism; plasmid; retroposon; Saccharomyces; Binding Sites; DNA, Fungal; Electroporation; Escherichia coli; Integrases; Plasmids; Retroelements; Saccharomyces; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transformation, Genetic",,"DNA, Fungal; Integrases, 2.7.7.-; Retroelements; SIR4 protein, S cerevisiae; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,,,,"Brady, T.L.",,,,,,,,10643745,,,18370074,"English","Methods Mol.

The chromoviruses are Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons with chromodomains at their integrase C termini. Chromodomains are logical determinants for targeting to heterochromatin, because the chromodomain of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) typically recognizes histone H3 K9 methylation, an epigenetic mark characteristic of heterochromatin. We describe three groups of chromoviruses based on amino acid sequence relationships of their integrase C termini. Genome sequence analysis indicates that representative chromoviruses from each group are enriched in gene-poor regions of the genome relative to other retrotransposons, and when fused to fluorescent marker proteins, the chromodomains target proteins to specific subnuclear foci coincident with heterochromatin. The chromodomain of the fungal element, MAGGY, interacts with histone H3 dimethyl- and trimethyl-K9, and when the MAGGY chromodomain is fused to integrase of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tf1 retrotransposon, new Tf1 insertions are directed to sites of H3 K9 methylation. Repetitive sequences such as transposable elements trigger the RNAi pathway resulting in their epigenetic modification. Our results suggest a dynamic interplay between retrotransposons and heterochromatin, wherein mobile elements recognize heterochromatin at the time of integration and then perpetuate the heterochromatic mark by triggering epigenetic modification. ©2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",,"amino acid sequence; article; carboxy terminal sequence; DNA modification; DNA sequence; epigenetics; gene insertion sequence; genetic epigenesis; genetic variability; genome analysis; heterochromatin; molecular recognition; priority journal; protein domain; protein methylation; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; retroposon; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; sequence analysis; transposon; Animals; Binding Sites; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genomics; Heterochromatin; Histones; Integrases; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Retroelements; Schizosaccharomyces pombe",,"Heterochromatin; Histones; Integrases, EC 2.7.7.-; Retroelements",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 796-815. , The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative; Asakawa, K., Toya, M., Sato, M., Kanai, M., Kume, K., Goshima, T., Garcia, M.A., Toda, T., Mal3, the fission yeast EB1 homologue, cooperates with Bub1 spindle checkpoint to prevent monopolar attachment (2005) EMBO Rep, 6, pp. 1194-1200; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1987) Current protocols in molecular biology, , Greene/Wiley Interscience, New York; Bachman, N., Gelbart, M.E., Tsukiyama, T., Boeke, J.D., TFIIIB subunit Bdp1p is required for periodic integration of the Ty1 retrotransposon and targeting of Isw2p to S. cerevisiae tDNAs (2005) Genes & Dev, 19, pp. 955-964; Bannister, A.J., Zegerman, P., Partridge, J.F., Miska, E.A., Thomas, J.O., Allshire, R.C., Kouzarides, T., Selective recognition of methylated lysine 9 on histone H3 by the HP1 chromo domain (2001) Nature, 410, pp. 120-124; Banno, H., Ikeda, Y., Niu, Q.W., Chua, N.H., Overexpression of Arabidopsis ESR1 induces initiation of shoot regeneration (2001) Plant Cell, 13, pp. 2609-2618; Behrens, R., Hayles, J., Nurse, P., Fission yeast retrotransposon Tf1 integration is targeted to 5′ ends of open reading frames (2000) Nucleic Acids Res, 28, pp. 4709-4716; Boeke, J.D., Devine, S.E., Yeast retrotransposons: Finding a nice quiet neighborhood (1998) Cell, 93, pp. 1087-1089; Bosher, J.M., Labouesse, M., RNA interference: Genetic wand and genetic watchdog (2000) Nat.

Carver Co-Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, United States","Mobile elements rely on cellular processes to replicate, and therefore, mobile element proteins frequently interact with a variety of cellular factors. The integrase (IN) encoded by the retrotransposon Ty5 interacts with the heterochromatin protein Sir4, and this interaction determines Ty5's preference to integrate into heterochromatin. We explored the hypothesis that Ty5's targeting mechanism arose by mimicking an interaction between Sir4 and another cellular protein (s). Mutational analyses defined the requirements for the IN-Sir4 interaction, providing criteria to screen for cellular analogues. Esc1, a protein associated with the inner nuclear membrane, interacted with the same domain of Sir4 as IN, and 75% of mutations that disrupted IN-Sir4 interactions also abrogated Esc1-Sir4 interactions. A small motif critical for recognizing Sir4 was identified in Esc1. The functional equivalency of this motif and the Sir4-interacting domain of IN was demonstrated by swapping these motifs and showing that the chimeric IN and Esc1 proteins effectively target integration and partition DNA, respectively. We conclude that Ty5 targets integration by imitating the Esc1-Sir4 interaction and suggest molecular mimicry as a general mechanism that enables mobile elements to interface with cellular processes.

Increasingly, this specificity is found to result from recognition by the retroelement of specific chromatin states or DNA-bound protein complexes. A well-studied example of such a targeted retroelement is the Saccharomyces Ty5 retrotransposon, which integrates into heterochromatin at the telomeres and silent mating loci. Targeting is mediated by an interaction between Ty5 integrase (IN) and the heterochromatin protein silent information regulator 4 (Sir4). A small motif of IN, called the targeting domain, is responsible for this interaction. Ty5 integration can be directed to DNA sites outside of heterochromatin by tethering Sir4 to ectopic locations using fusion proteins between Sir4 and a DNA-binding domain. Alternatively, the targeting domain of Ty5 can be swapped with peptides that recognize other protein partners, thereby generating Ty5 elements with new target specificities. The mechanism of Ty5 target site choice suggests that integration specificity of other retrotransposons and retroviruses can be altered by engineering integrases to recognize DNA-bound protein partners. Retroelements can also be used to probe chromatin dynamics and the distribution of protein complexes on chromosomes. Here, we describe the basic assay by which Ty5 integration is monitored to sites of tethered Sir4. © 2008 Humana Press Inc.","Chromatin; Integrase; Integration; Retrotransposon; Retrovirus; Specificity","Saccharomyces",,,,,,"Kazazian Jr., H.H., Mobile elements: Drivers of genome evolution (2004) Science, 303, pp. 1626-1632; Hua-Van, A., Le Rouzic, A., Maisonhaute, C., Capy, P., Abundance, distribution and dynamics of retrotransposable elements and transposons: Similarities and differences (2005) Cytogenet.

Target specificity is mediated by a small domain of Ty5 integrase (the targeting domain, TD), which interacts with the heterochromatin protein Sir4 and tethers the integration complex to target sites. Here we demonstrate that TD is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation is required for interaction with Sir4. The yeast cell, therefore, through posttranslational modification, controls Ty5's mutagenic potential: when TD is phosphorylated, insertions occur in gene-poor heterochromatin, thereby minimizing deleterious consequences of transposition; however, in the absence of phosphorylation, Ty5 integrates throughout the genome, frequently causing mutations. TD phosphorylation is reduced under stress conditions, specifically starvation for amino acids, nitrogen, or fermentable carbon. This suggests that Ty5 target specificity changes in response to nutrient availability and is consistent with McClintock's hypothesis that mobile elements restructure host genomes as an adaptive response to environmental challenge. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The current version of ZiFiT is based on a widely employed method of ZFP design, the 'modular assembly' approach, in which pre-existing individual zinc fingers are linked together to recognize desired target DNA sequences. Several research groups have described experimentally characterized zinc finger modules that bind many of the 64 possible DNA triplets. ZiFiT leverages the combined capabilities of three of the largest and best characterized module archives by enabling users to select fingers from any of these sets. ZiFiT searches a query DNA sequence for target sites for which a ZFP can be designed using modules available in one or more of the three archives. In addition, ZiFiT output facilitates identification of specific zinc finger modules that are publicly available from the Zinc Finger Consortium.

Although several platforms for constructing artificial zinc finger arrays using ""modular assembly"" have been described, standardized reagents and protocols that permit rapid, cross-platform ""mixing-and-matching"" of the various zinc finger modules are not available. Here we describe a comprehensive, publicly available archive of plasmids encoding more than 140 well-characterized zinc finger modules together with complementary web-based software (termed ZiFiT) for identifying potential zinc finger target sites in a gene of interest. Our reagents have been standardized on a single platform, enabling facile mixing-and-matching of modules and transfer of assembled arrays to expression vectors without the need for specialized knowledge of zinc finger sequences or complicated oligonucleotide design. We also describe a bacterial cell-based reporter assay for rapidly screening the DNA-binding activities of assembled multi-finger arrays.

The Sireviruses vary greatly in their genomic organization, and many have acquired additional coding information in the form of an envelope-like open reading frame and an extended gag gene. Two-hybrid screens were conducted with the novel domain of Gag (the Gag extension) encoded by a representative Sirevirus from maize (Zea mays) called Hopie. The Hopie Gag extension interacts with a protein related to dynein light chain 8 (LC8). LC8 also interacts with the Gag extension from a Hopie homolog from rice (Oryza sativa). Amino acid motifs were identified in both Hopie Gag and LC8 that are responsible for the interaction. Two amino acids critical for Gag recognition map within the predicted LC8-binding cleft. Two-hybrid screens were also conducted with the Gag extension encoded by the soybean (Glycine max) SIRE1 element, and an interaction was found with light chain 6 (LC6), a member of the LC8 protein family. LC8 and LC6 proteins are components of the dynein microtubule motor, with LC8 being a versatile adapter that can bind many unrelated cellular proteins and viruses. Plant LC8 and LC6 genes are abundant and divergent, yet flowering plants do not encode other components of the dynein motor. Although, to our knowledge, no cellular roles for plant LC8 family members have been proposed, we hypothesize that binding of LC8 proteins to Gag aids in the movement of retrotransposon virus-like particles within the plant cell or possibly induces important conformational changes in the Gag protein. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Amino acids; Conformations; Genetic engineering; Plants (botany); Proteins; Copia retrotransposons; Dynein light chain; Hopie Gag extension; Sireviruses; Viruses; Amino Acids; Cells; Plants; Proteins; Viruses; Glycine max; Magnoliophyta; Oryza sativa; Zea mays; carrier protein; ctp protein, Drosophila; Drosophila protein; Gag protein; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; article; binding site; genetics; genome; growth, development and aging; maize; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; plant; plant virus; protein binding; retroposon; sequence homology; structural gene; two hybrid system; virology; virus genome; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Carrier Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; Gene Products, gag; Genes, gag; Genome, Plant; Genome, Viral; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Plant Viruses; Plants; Protein Binding; Retroelements; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; Zea mays","GENBANK: A56444, AAD41631, AAF05842, AAH70342, AC116033, AC122723, AC130810, AF503433, AF506028, AV427824, AW035288, AY096447, AY096707, AY205608, BAA85215, BAB89069, BAC56467, BE494592, BG047902, BQ403386, BQ593661, BT004785, BT010683, BT011208, CA783196, CA921018, CB305057, CF627955, CN844329, NP_062656, NP_998189, O02414, P63167, Q22799, Q24117, Q94758, U19484, U35468, U68408, U81827","carrier protein, 80700-39-6; Carrier Proteins; ctp protein, Drosophila; Drosophila Proteins; Gene Products, gag; Plant Proteins; Retroelements",,,,"Alonso, C., Miskin, J., Hernaez, B., Fernandez-Zapatero, P., Soto, L., Canto, C., Rodriguez-Crespo, I., Escribano, J.M., African swine fever virus protein p54 interacts with the microtubular motor complex through direct binding to light-chain dynein (2001) J Virol, 75, pp. 9819-9827; Aye, M., Irwin, B., Beliakova-Bethell, N., Chen, E., Garnis, J., Sandmeyer, S., Host factors that affect Ty3 retrotransposition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2004) Genetics, 168, pp. 1159-1176; Bartel, P.L., Fields, S., Analyzing protein-protein interactions using two-hybrid system (1995) Methods Enzymol, 254, pp. 241-263; Berger, B., Wilson, D.B., Wolf, E., Tonchev, T., Milla, M., Kim, P.S., Predicting coiled coils by use of pairwise residue correlations (1995) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 92, pp. 8259-8263; Boeke, J.D., Eickbush, T.H., Sandmeyer, S.B., Voytas, D.F., Pseudoviridae (2004) Virus Taxonomy: Eighth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, pp. 663-672. , CM Fauquet, ed.

Carver Co-Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, United States","Homologous recombination offers great promise for plant genome engineering. This promise has not been realized, however, because when DNA enters plant cells homologous recombination occurs infrequently and random integration predominates. Using a tobacco test system, we demonstrate that chromosome breaks created by zinc-finger nucleases greatly enhance the frequency of localized recombination. Homologous recombination was measured by restoring function to a defective GUS:NPTII reporter gene integrated at various chromosomal sites in 10 different transgenic tobacco lines. The reporter gene carried a recognition site for a zinc-finger nuclease, and protoplasts from each tobacco line were electroporated with both DNA encoding the nuclease and donor DNA to effect repair of the reporter. Homologous recombination occurred in more than 10% of the transformed protoplasts regardless of the reporter's chromosomal position. Approximately 20% of the GUS:NPTII reporter genes were repaired solely by homologous recombination, whereas the remainder had associated DNA insertions or deletions consistent with repair by both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. The DNA-binding domain encoded by zinc-finger nucleases can be engineered to recognize a variety of chromosomal target sequences. This flexibility, coupled with the enhancement in homologous recombination conferred by double-strand breaks, suggests that plant genome engineering through homologous recombination can now be reliably accomplished using zinc-finger nucleases. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Double-strand breaks; Gene targeting; Genome engineering; Non-homologous end joining; Protoplast","DNA; Genetic engineering; Tobacco; Double-strand breaks; Gene targeting; Genome engineering; Non-homologous end joining; Plants (botany); Genetic Engineering; Nucleic Acids; Plants; Protoplasm; Tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum; hybrid protein; plant DNA; type II site specific deoxyribonuclease; zinc finger protein; article; biological model; enzymology; genetic engineering; genetic recombination; genetics; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; plant; reporter gene; tobacco; transgenic plant; Base Sequence; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific; DNA, Plant; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Engineering; Models, Genetic; Plants; Plants, Genetically Modified; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Recombination, Genetic; Tobacco; Zinc Fingers",,"Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific, EC 3.1.21.4; DNA, Plant; Recombinant Fusion Proteins",,,,"Adams, T.L., Townsend, J.A., A new procedure for increasing efficiency of protoplast plating and clone selection (1983) Plant Cell Rep., 2, pp. 165-168; Bibikova, M., Carroll, D., Segal, D.J., Trautman, J.K., Smith, J., Kim, Y.G., Chandrasegaran, S., Stimulation of homologous recombination through targeted cleavage by chimeric nucleases (2001) Mol.

For the protein families with known functional subtypes (a functional split), we developed the software, SplitTester, to identify potential regions that are responsible for the observed distinct functional subtypes within the same protein family. Results: Our software, SplitTester, takes a multiple protein sequences alignment as input, generated from protein members of two subgroups with known functional divergence. SplitTester was designed to construct the neighbor joining tree (a split cluster) from variable-sized sliding windows across the alignment in a process called split-clustering. SplitTester identifies the regions, whose split cluster is consistent with the functional split, but may be inconsistent with the phylogeny of the protein family. We hypothesize that at least some number of these identified regions, which are not following a random mutation process, are responsible for the observed functional split. To test our method, we used reverse transcriptase from a group of Pseudoviridae retrotransposons: to identify residues specific for diverged primer recognition. Candidate regions were then mapped onto the three dimensional structures of reverse transcriptase. The locations of these amino acids within the enzyme are consistent with their biological roles. Conclusions: SplitTester aims to identify specific domain sequences responsible for functional divergence of subgroups within a protein family. From the analysis of retroelements reverse transcriptase family, we successfully identified the regions splitting this family according to the primer specificity, implying their functions in the specific primer selection. © 2005 Gao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Gene duplications; Neighbor joining; Potential region; Protein sequences; Random mutation; Reverse transcriptases; Specific primers; Three-dimensional structure; Alignment; Amino acids; Biology; Proteins; amino acid; RNA directed DNA polymerase; virus enzyme; primer DNA; protein; protein binding; retroposon; algorithm; article; computer program; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; protein analysis; protein domain; protein family; protein function; protein polymorphism; retroposon; RNA virus; sequence alignment; amino acid sequence; biological model; biology; chemistry; cluster analysis; computer graphics; computer language; gene duplication; genetics; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; multigene family; procedures; protein database; protein tertiary structure; sequence analysis; sequence homology; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Computer Graphics; Databases, Protein; DNA Primers; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Duplication; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Programming Languages; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proteins; Retroelements; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Software","GENBANK: AF053008, M11240, M18706, U19263, U68408, X07656, X13777, X69552","RNA directed DNA polymerase, 37213-50-6, 9068-38-6; amino acid, 65072-01-7; protein, 67254-75-5; RNA directed DNA polymerase, 37213-50-6, 9068-38-6; DNA Primers; Proteins; Retroelements; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase","SplitTester",,,"Tatusov, R.L., Koonin, E.V., Lipman, D.J., A genomic perspective on protein families (1997) Science, 278 (5338), pp. 631-637; Golding, G.B., Dean, A.M., The structural basis of molecular adaptation (1998) Mol.

The high quality of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence makes it possible to comprehensively characterize retroelement populations and explore factors that contribute to their genomic distribution. RESULTS: We identified the full complement of A. thaliana long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements using RetroMap, a software tool that iteratively searches genome sequences for reverse transcriptases and then defines retroelement insertions. Relative ages of full-length elements were estimated by assessing sequence divergence between LTRs: the Pseudoviridae were significantly younger than the Metaviridae. All retroelement insertions were mapped onto the genome sequence and their distribution was distinctly non-uniform. Although both Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae tend to cluster within pericentromeric heterochromatin, this association is significantly more pronounced for all three Metaviridae sublineages (Metavirus, Tat and Athila). Among these, Tat and Athila are strictly associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin. CONCLUSIONS: The non-uniform genomic distribution of the Pseudoviridae and the Metaviridae can be explained by a variety of factors including target-site bias, selection against integration into euchromatin and pericentromeric accumulation of elements as a result of suppression of recombination. However, comparisons based on the age of elements and their chromosomal location indicate that integration-site specificity is likely to be the primary factor determining distribution of the Athila and Tat sublineages of the Metaviridae. We predict that, like retroelements in yeast, the Athila and Tat elements target integration to pericentromeric regions by recognizing a specific feature of pericentromeric heterochromatin.",,"Arabidopsis; article; biological model; biology; gene expression regulation; gene targeting; genetics; genomics; long terminal repeat; plant chromosome; plant virus; retroposon; time; virology; virus DNA cell DNA interaction; Arabidopsis; Chromosomes, Plant; Computational Biology; Gene Targeting; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Plant Viruses; Retroelements; Terminal Repeat Sequences; Time Factors; Virus Integration",,"Retroelements",,,,,"Peterson-Burch, B.D.email: bburch@nadc.ars.usda.gov",,,,,,,,14656914,,,15461796,"English","Genome Biol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-27944499244

To assess the diversity of recoding strategies, we surveyed gag/pol gene organization among retroelements from diverse host species, including elements exhaustively recovered from the genome sequences of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans, and Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast to the retroviruses, which typically encode pol in the -1 frame relative to gag, nearly half of the retroelements surveyed encode a single gag-pol open reading frame. This was particularly true for the Ty1/copia group retroelements. Most animal Ty3/gypsy retroelements, on the other hand, encode gag and pol in separate reading frames, and likely express Pol through +1 or -1 frameshifting. Conserved sequences conforming to slippery sites that specify viral ribosomal frameshifting were identified among retroelements with pol in the -1 frame. None of the plant retroelements encoded pol in the -1 frame relative to gag; however, two closely related plant Ty3/gypsy elements encode pol in the +1 frame. Interestingly, a group of plant Ty1/copia retroelements encode pol either in a +1 frame relative to gag or in two nonoverlapping reading frames. These retroelements have a conserved stem-loop at the end of gag, and likely express pol either by a novel means of internal ribosomal entry or by a bypass mechanism.","Frameshifting; Recoding; Retrotransposon; Translational regulation","Gag protein; Pol protein; Arabidopsis; Caenorhabditis elegans; Candida albicans; cladistics; Drosophila melanogaster; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic code; genetic organization; genome; host; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; plant; priority journal; protein expression; retroposon; Retrovirus; review; ribosomal frameshifting; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; signal transduction; species; tandem repeat; Base Sequence; Codon, Terminator; DNA; Genes, gag; Genes, pol; Molecular Sequence Data; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; Protein Biosynthesis; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Retroelements; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Animalia; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Caenorhabditis; Caenorhabditis elegans; Candida; Candida albicans; Drosophila melanogaster; Melanogaster; Schizosaccharomyces; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; unidentified retrovirus","GENBANK: AB026651, AC007209, AF030881, AF050215, AF053008, AF506028, AJ133521, L09635, L10324, M11240, M11339, M23367, U15406, U19263, U23420, U68408, X60774, Y08010","Codon, Terminator; DNA, 9007-49-2; Retroelements",,,,"Abe, H., Ohbayashi, F., Sugasaki, T., Kanehara, M., Terada, T., Shimada, T., Kawai, S., Yamamoto, M.T., Two novel Pao-like retrotransposons (Kamikaze and Yamato) from the silkworm species Bombyx mori and B. mandarina: Common structural features of Pao-like elements (2001) Mol.

Target specificity is mediated by a six amino acid sequence motif (the targeting domain, TD) of integrase that interacts with Sir4p, a structural component of heterochromatin. When tethered to CEN plasmids as part of a Gal4p DNA binding domain (GBD) fusion protein, TD destabilizes plasmid segregation in a manner similar to that observed for CEN + HM or CEN +TEL antagonism. This instability is caused by the ability of TD to nucleate components of heterochromatin on the CEN plasmid, because CEN +TD antagonism is abrogated by sir2, sir3 and sir4 mutations and by TD mutations that prevent interaction with Sir4p. In strains that acquire resistance to CEN +TD antagonism, the CEN plasmid has either recombined with a 2 μ plasmid or sustained deletions in sequences required to bind GBD-TD. CEN +TD and CEN + HM antagonism is exacerbated by mutations in components of the Ku-mediated non-homologous end-joining pathway. These observations suggest that CEN antagonism is caused by DNA breaks that result from competition between CEN - and Sir-specific segregation pathways. © Springer-Verlag 2003.",,"Gal4p DNA binding domain fusion protein;

Here we report the characterization and comparison of eight different SIRE1 elements derived from a soybean genomic library, as well as SIRE1 reverse transcriptases from Glycine soja. The DNA sequences of the eight SIRE1 elements are highly homogeneous and share greater than 95% nucleotide identity. Partial sequences obtained from BAC ends are similarly conserved. Phylogenetic analyses resolve two closely related SIRE1 lineages, and nucleotide changes within and between SIRE1 lineages have occurred to preserve function. Both the gag and the env-like genes are evolving under similar levels of functional constraint. Considerable sequence heterogeneity in the form of short duplications was found within the LTRs and in the region between the envelope-like ORF and the 3′ LTR. These duplications are suggestive of slippage by reverse transcriptase during replication. Sequence identity between LTRs of individual insertions suggests that they transposed within the past 70,000 years. Two of 10 SIRE1 insertions examined abut Ty3-gypsy retroelements. Since the soybean genome harbors more than 1,000 SIRE1 insertions, the collective data suggest that SIRE1 has undergone a very recent and robust amplification in soybean.","Endogenous retrovirus; Glycine max; Phylogenetics; Retrotransposon; Ty1-copia","virus envelope protein; article; DNA sequence; genetic analysis; long terminal repeat; molecular dynamics; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; protein family; retroposon; Retrovirus; Southern blotting; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Plant; Endogenous Retroviruses; Genome, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retroelements; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Sequence Alignment; Soybeans; Terminal Repeat Sequences; DNA viruses; Glycine max; Glycine soja; unidentified retrovirus","GENBANK: AB013289, AF002257, AF053008, AF095730, AY205606, AY205607, AY205608, AY205609, AY205610, AY205611, AY205612, AY205613, AY212109, AY212110, AZ221409","DNA, Plant; Retroelements; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, EC 2.7.7.49",,,,"Agrawal, G.K., Yamazaki, M., Kobayashi, M., Hirochika, R., Miyao, A., Hirochika, H., Screening of the rice viviparous mutants generated by endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 insertion: Tagging of a zeaxanthin epoxidase gene and a novel OsTATC gene (2001) Plant Physiol., 125, pp. 1248-1257; Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J.H., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped Blast and Psi-Blast - A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402; Baumann, K., De Paolis, A., Costantino, P., Gualberti, G., The DNA binding site of the Dof protein NtBBF1 is essential for tissue-specific and auxin-regulated expression of the rolB oncogene in plants (1999) Plant Cell, 11, pp. 323-333; Beier, H., Grimm, M., Misreading of termination codons in eukaryotes by natural nonsense suppressor tRNAs (2001) Nucleic Acids Res., 29, pp. 4767-4782; Bennetzen, J.L., Transposable element contributions to plant gene and genome evolution (2000) Plant Mol.

For the yeast retrotransposon Ty5, integration preferentially occurs within domains of heterochromatin. Targeting to these locations is determined by interactions between an amino acid sequence motif at the C terminus of Ty5 integrase (IN) called the targeting domain, and the heterochromatin protein Sir4p. Here we show that new Ty5 integration hot spots are created when Sir4p is tethered to ectopic DNA sites. Targeting to sites of tethered Sir4p is abrogated by single amino acid substitutions in either IN or Sir4p that prevent their interaction. Ty5 target specificity can be altered by replacing the IN-targeting domain with other peptide motifs that interact with known protein partners. Integration occurs at high efficiency and in close proximity to DNA sites where the protein partners are tethered. These findings define a mechanism by which retrotransposons shape their host genomes and suggest ways in which retroviral integration can be controlled.",,"integrase; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; article; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; eukaryote; genome; heterochromatin; nonhuman; priority journal; protein DNA binding; protein domain; protein motif; protein targeting; retroposon; Retrovirus; yeast; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Restriction Mapping; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Serine Endopeptidases; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Eukaryota; Prokaryota; unidentified retrovirus",,"Bacterial Proteins; LexA protein, Bacteria; Retroelements; Serine Endopeptidases, EC 3.4.21.-; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; SIR4 protein, S cerevisiae",,,,"Medstrand, P., Van De Lagemaat, L.N., Mager, D.L., (2002) Genome Res., 12, pp. 1483-1495; SanMiguel, P., Tikhonov, A., Jin, Y.K., Motchoulskaia, N., Zakharov, D., Melake-Berhan, A., Springer, P.S., Avramova, Z., (1996) Science, 274, pp. 765-768; Boeke, J.D., Devine, S.E., (1998) Cell, 93, pp. 1087-1089; Craig, N.L., (1997) Annu.

The six nucleotides immediately downstream of the stop codon conform to a degenerate nucleotide motif, CARYYA, which is sufficient to facilitate stop codon suppression in tobacco mosaic virus. In vivo stop codon suppression assays indicate that SIRE1 sequences confer leakiness to the UAG stop codon at an efficiency of 5%.

We have analyzed factors affecting target site selection of SB in mammalian cells, by generating transposition events from extrachromosomal plasmids to chromosomes. In contrast to the local hopping observed when transposition is induced from a chromosomal context, mapping of 138 unique SB insertions on human chromosomes showed a fairly random genomic distribution, and a 35% occurrence of transposition into genes. Inspection of the DNA flanking the sites of element integration revealed significant differences from random DNA in both primary sequence and physical properties. The consensus sequence of SB target sites was found to be a palindromic AT-repeat, ATATATAT, in which the central TA is the canonical target site. We found however, that target site selection is determined primarily on the level of DNA structure, and not by specific base-pair interactions. Computational analyses revealed that insertion sites tend to have a bendable structure and a palindromic pattern of potential hydrogen-bonding sites in the major groove of the DNA. These features appear conserved in the Tc1/mariner family of transposons and in other, distantly related elements that share a common catalytic domain of the transposase, and integrate fairly randomly. No similar target site preference was found for non-randomly integrating elements. Our results suggest common factors influencing target site selection of a wide range of transposable elements. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Plant genomes were the most abundant sources of Pseudoviridae, with the Arabidopsis thaliana genome having 276 distinct elements. A reverse transcriptase amino acid sequence phylogeny indicated that the Pseudoviridae comprises highly divergent members. Coding sequences for a representative subset of elements were analyzed to identify conserved domains and differences that may underlie functional divergence. With the exception of some fungal elements (e.g., Ty1), most Pseudoviridae encode Gag and Pol on a single open reading frame. In addition to the nearly ubiquitous RNA-binding motif of nucleocapsid, three new conserved domains were identified in Gag, pol-encoded aspartic protease was similar to the retroviral enzyme and could be mapped onto the HIV-1 structure. Pol was highly conserved throughout the family. The greatest divergence among Pol sequences was seen in the C-terminus of integrase (IN). We defined a large motif (GKGY) after the IN catalytic domain that is unique to the Pseudoviridae. Additionally, the extreme C-terminus of IN is rich in simple sequence motifs. A distinct lineage of Pseudoviridae in plants have envlike genes. This lineage has undergone a large expansion of Gag characterized by an α-helix-rich domain containing coiled-coil motifs. In several elements, this domain is flanked on both sides by RNA-binding domains. We propose that this monophyletic lineage defines a new Pseudoviridae genus, herein referred to as the Agrovirus.","env; gag; pol; Pseudoviridae; Retrotransposon","Gag protein; integrase; proteinase; RNA directed DNA polymerase; virus protein; amino acid sequence; article; carboxy terminal sequence; DNA flanking region; gene sequence; genetic analysis; long terminal repeat; multigene family; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein domain; retroposon; sequence analysis; transposon; virus genome; animal; chemical structure; chemistry; genetics; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; phylogeny; protein conformation; structural gene; virus gene; Arabidopsis thaliana; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; RNA viruses; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, gag; Genes, pol; Genes, Viral; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Protein Conformation; Retroelements; Viral Proteins","GENBANK: AB021265, AF005762, AF039373, AF050215, AF053008, AF065434, AF082133, AF134899, AJ000893, AY016208, D83003, D85597, M11240, M18706, M94164, U12626, U19263, U41000, U68072, U68408, U72726, U90320, U96748, X07656, X13291, X13777, X52387, X66399, X69552, Y08010, Y12321, Z17327","Retroelements; Viral Proteins",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, pp. 3389-3402; Atwood, A., Lin, J.H., Levin, H.L., The retrotransposon Tf1 assembles virus-like particles that contain excess Gag relative to integrase because of a regulated degradation process (1996) Mol.

Film images can be analyzed by densitometry as described to obtain a quantitative measure of the radioactivity in the sample. The use of X-ray films for autoradiography, however, suffers from lack of sensitivity and limited linear range. Protocols are provided for overcoming these limitations using fluorography and intensifying screens, both of which enhance the radioactive signal. Sensitivity and linear ranges of measurement can be greatly extended by using a phosphor imaging system, which also makes it much faster and easier to quantify radioactive samples.",,"DNA; protein; radioisotope; article; autoradiography; densitometry; fluorescence; image quality; immunoblotting; isotope labeling; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; X ray film; Autoradiography; Densitometry; DNA; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Fluorescence; Immunoblotting; Isotope Labeling; Proteins; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radioisotopes; X-Ray Film",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; protein, 67254-75-5; DNA, 9007-49-2; Proteins; Radioisotopes",,,,,"Voytas, D.",,,,,,,,1934368X,,,18432864,"English","Curr Protoc Immunol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-43549104905

The low transposition activity of Ty5 could be due to differences in cellular environments between these yeast species or to naturally occurring mutations in Ty5. By screening of a Ty5 mutant library, two single mutants (D252N and Y68C) were each found to increase transposition approximately sixfold. When combined, transposition increased 36-fold, implying that the two mutations act independently. Neither mutation affected Ty5 protein synthesis, processing, cDNA recombination, or target site choice. However, cDNA levels in both single mutants and the double mutant were significantly higher than in the wild type. The D252N mutation resides in the zinc finger of nucleocapsid and increases the potential for hydrogen bonding with nucleic acids. We generated other mutations that increase the hydrogen bonding potential (i.e., D252R and D252K) and found that they similarly increased transposition. This suggests that hydrogen bonding within the zinc finger motif is important for cDNA production and builds upon previous studies implicating basic amino acids flanking the zinc finger as important for zinc finger function. Although NCp zinc fingers differ from the zinc finger motifs of cellular enzymes, the requirement for efficient hydrogen bonding is likely universal.",,"zinc finger protein; article; enzyme activity; gene mutation; genetic organization; hydrogen bond; nonhuman; open reading frame; priority journal; protein assembly; protein domain; protein processing; protein synthesis; retroposon; virus genome; virus nucleocapsid; zinc finger motif; Amino Acid Sequence; DNA, Complementary; Fungal Proteins; Hydrogen Bonding; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Nucleocapsid; Retroelements; Saccharomyces; Sequence Alignment; Zinc Fingers",,"DNA, Complementary; Fungal Proteins; Retroelements",,,,"Allain, B., Lapadat-Tapolsky, M., Berlioz, C., Darlix, J.L., Transactivation of the minus-strand DNA transfer by nucleocapsid protein during reverse transcription of the retroviral genome (1994) EMBO J., 13, pp. 973-981; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1987) Current protocols in molecular biology, , Greene/Wiley Interscience, New York, N.Y; Barat, C., Schatz, O., Le Grice, S., Darlix, J.L., Analysis of the interactions of HIV1 replication primer tRNA(Lys,3) with nucleocapsid protein and reverse transcriptase (1993) J.

Because most insertions are highly degenerate, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the A. thaliana genome sequence to discern their conserved features. One family (Athila4) was identified whose members are largely intact and share >94% nucleotide identity. As a basis for comparison, related elements (the Calypso elements) were characterized from soybean. Consensus Calypso and Athila4 elements are 12-14 kb in length and have long terminal repeats of 1.3-1.8 kb. Gag and Pol are encoded on a single open reading frame (ORF) of 1801 (Calypso) and 1911 (Athila4) amino acids. Following the Gag-Pol ORF are noncoding regions of ∼0.7 and 2 kb, which, respectively, flank the env-like gene. The env-like ORF begins with a putative splice acceptor site and encodes a protein with a predicted central transmembrane domain, similar to retroviral env genes. RNA of Athila elements was detected in an A. thaliana strain with decreased DNA methylation (ddml). Additionally, a PCR survey identified related reverse transcriptases in diverse angiosperm genomes. Their ubiquitous nature and the potential for horizontal transfer by infection implicates these endogenous retroviruses as important vehicles for plant genome evolution.",,"Gag protein; membrane protein; nucleotide; plant RNA; Pol protein; RNA directed DNA polymerase; virus envelope protein; angiosperm; Arabidopsis; article; binding site; controlled study; DNA methylation; envelope gene; enzyme assay; gene insertion; gene sequence; genetic code; genetic conservation; genetic identification; genetic strain; horizontal gene transfer; long terminal repeat; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; plant evolution; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein domain; retroposon; Retrovirus; sequence analysis; soybean; untranslated region; virus carrier; virus infection; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Endogenous Retroviruses; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Frequency; Genes, env; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Viruses; Retroelements; Soybeans; Viral Envelope Proteins; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Calypso; Embryophyta; Glycine max; insertion sequences; Magnoliophyta; RNA viruses; unidentified retrovirus","EMBL: AB026642, AC007209, AC007534, AF186182, AF186183, AF186184, AF186185, AF186186, AF296831, AF378012, AF378013, AF378014, AF378015, AF378016, AF378017, AF378018, AF378019, AF378020, AF378021, AF378022, AF378023, AF378024, AF378025, AF378026, AF378027, AF378028, AF378029, AF378030, AF378031, AF378032, AF378033, AF378034, AF378035, AF378036, AF378037, AF378038, AF378039, AF378040, AF378041, AF378042, AF378043, AF378044, AF378045, AF378046, AF378047, AF378048, AF378049, AF378050, AF378051, AF378052, AF378053, AF378054, AF378055, AF378056, AF378057, AF378058, AF378059, AF378060, AF378061, AF378062, AF378063, AF378064, AF378065, AF378066, AF378067, AF378068, AF378069, AF378070, AF378071, AF378072, AF378073, AF378074, AF378075, AF378076, AF378077, AF378078, AF378079, AF378080, AF378081; GENBANK: AF186182, AF186183, AF186184, AF186185, AF186186, AF378012, AF378013, AF378014, AF378015, AF378016, AF378017, AF378018, AF378019, AF378020, AF378021, AF378022, AF378023, AF378024, AF378025, AF378025, AF378026, AF378027, AF378028, AF378029, AF378030, AF378031, AF378032, AF378033, AF378034, AF378035, AF378036, AF378037, AF378038, AF378039, AF378040, AF378041, AF378042, AF378043, AF378044, AF378045, AF378046, AF378047, AF378048, AF378049, AF378050, AF378051, AF378052, AF378053, AF378054, AF378055, AF378056, AF378057, AF378058, AF378059, AF378060, AF378061, AF378062, AF378063, AF378064, AF378065, AF378066, AF378067, AF378068, AF378069, AF378070, AF378071, AF378072, AF378073, AF378074, AF378075, AF378076, AF378077, AF378078, AF378079, AF378080, AF378081; AF095730, AP003054","RNA directed DNA polymerase, 37213-50-6, 9068-38-6; Retroelements; Viral Envelope Proteins",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

We define a Ty5-encoded targeting domain that spans 6 amino acid residues near the C terminus of integrase (LXSSXP). The targeting domain establishes silent chromatin when it is tethered to a weakened HMR-E silencer, and it disrupts telomeric silencing when it is overexpressed. As determined by both yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, the targeting domain interacts with the C terminus of Sir4p, a structural component of silent chromatin. This interaction is abrogated by mutations in the targeting domain that disrupt integration into silent chromatin, suggesting that recognition of Sir4p by the targeting domain is the primary determinant in Ty5 target specificity.",,"histone deacetylase; integrase; protein sir4p; unclassified drug; article; carboxy terminal sequence; chromatin; gene disruption; gene locus; gene mutation; gene overexpression; gene targeting; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein protein interaction; retroposon; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; telomere; Amino Acid Motifs; Binding Sites; Chromatin; Fungal Proteins; Gene Silencing; Genes, Fungal; Integrases; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Telomere; Transformation, Genetic; Two-Hybrid System Techniques",,"Chromatin; Fungal Proteins; Integrases, EC 2.7.7.-; Retroelements; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; SIR4 protein, S cerevisiae",,,,"Andrulis, E.D., Neiman, A.M., Zappulla, D.C., Sternglanz, R., Perinuclear localization of chromatin facilitates transcriptional silencing (1998) Nature, 394, pp. 592-595; Ansari, A., Gartenberg, M.R., The yeast silent information regulator Sir4p anchors and partitions plasmids (1997) Mol.

Two protocols for generating nested subclones via enzymatic digestion are included in this unit. In the first, a set of nested deletions is generated by exonuclease III. The primary advantage of this method is that the deletion products generated from the original clone can be recircularized to generate functional plasmids and thus do not require subcloning into another vector. An alternate method utilizes Bal 31 nuclease to generate the deletions. This method requires subcloning of the deletion fragments into a separate vector for subsequent use. Both methods require the presence of unique restriction sites in the vector that are not present in the insert DNA.

For many retroelements, gag and pol are present on separate reading frames. Their expression is highly regulated, and the ratio of Gag to Pol is critical for retroelement replication. The Saccharomyces retrotransposon Ty5 contains a single open reading frame, and we characterized Gag and Pol expression by generating transpositionally active Ty5 elements with epitope tags at the N terminus or C terminus or within the integrase coding region. Immunoblot analysis identified two Gag species (Gag-p27 and Gag-p37), reverse transcriptase (Pol-p59), and integrase (Pol-p80), all of which are largely insoluble in the absence of urea or ionic detergent. These proteins result from proteolytic processing of a polyprotein, because elements with mutations in the presumed active site of Ty5 protease express a single tagged protein (Gag-Pol-p182). Protease mutants are also transpositionally inactive. In a time course experiment, we monitored protein expression, proteolytic processing, and transposition of a Ty5 element with identical epitope tags at its N and C termini. Both transposition and the abundance of Gag-p27 increased over time. In contrast, the levels of Gag-p37 and reverse transcriptase peaked after ∼14 h of induction and then gradually decreased. This may be due to differences in stability of Gag-p27 relative to Gag-p37 and reverse transcriptase. The ratio of Ty5 Gag to Pol averaged 5:1 throughout the time course experiment, suggesting that differential protein stability regulates the amounts of these proteins.",,"detergent; epitope; Gag protein; integrase; Pol protein; protein p27; proteinase; RNA directed DNA polymerase; urea; amino terminal sequence; article; carboxy terminal sequence; DNA transposition; enzyme activity; nonhuman; open reading frame; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein processing; protein stability; retroposon; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence analysis; Fungal Proteins; Fusion Proteins, gag-pol; Immunoblotting; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Retroelements; RNA, Messenger; Saccharomyces",,"Fungal Proteins; Fusion Proteins, gag-pol; Retroelements; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Atwood, A., Lin, J.H., Levin, H.L., The retrotransposon Tf1 assembles virus-like particles that contain excess Gag relative to integrase because of a regulated degradation process (1996) Mol.

Cells in the green sectors contain morphologically normal chloroplasts, whereas cells in the white sectors contain non-pigmented plastids that lack organized lamellar structures. Many variegations are caused by mutations in nuclear genes that affect plastid function, yet in only a few cases have the responsible genes been cloned. We show that mutations in the nuclear VAR2 locus of Arabidopsis cause variegation due to loss of a chloroplast thylakoid membrane protein that bears similarity to the FtsH family of AAA proteins (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities). Escherichia coil FtsH is a chaperone metalloprotease that functions in a number of diverse membrane-associated events. Although FtsH homologs have been identified in multicellular organisms, their functions and activities are largely unknown; we provide genetic in vivo evidence that VAR2 functions in thylakoid membrane biogenesis. We have isolated four var2 alleles and they have allowed us to define domains of the protein that are required for activity. These include two putative ATP-binding sites. VAR2 protein amounts generally correlate with the severity of the var2 mutant phenotype. One allele lacks detectable VAR2 protein, suggesting that the mechanism of var2 variegation involves the action of a redundant activity in the green sectors. We conclude that redundant activities may be a general mechanism to explain nuclear gene-induced plant variegations.",,"adenosine triphosphate; allele; binding site; chloroplast; Escherichia coli; gene locus; gene mutation; metalloproteinase; phenotype; protein domain; protein function; thylakoid; VAR2 gene; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; ATP-Dependent Proteases; Chloroplasts; Cloning, Molecular; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Plant Leaves; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta; Escherichia; Escherichia coli","GENBANK: AF135189","Arabidopsis Proteins; ATP-Dependent Proteases, EC 3.4.21.-; Membrane Proteins; VAR2 protein, Arabidopsis, EC 3.4.21.-",,,,"Akiyama, Y., Ogura, T., Ito, K., Involvement of FtsH in protein assembly into and through the membrane.

This is the case for the yeast Ty5 retrotransposons, which preferentially integrate into domains of silent chromatin at the HM loci and telomeres. Here we demonstrate that loss of Sir3p or Sir4p - components of silent chromatin - causes a greater than ninefold decrease in Ty5 targeting to the HM loci and largely randomizes chromosomal integration patterns. Strains with a deletion of SIR4 also display an ~10-fold increase in cDNA recombination, which is due both to the expression a- and α-mating-type information and the loss of Sir4p. It is known that in old yeast cells or in strains carrying the sir4-42 allele, the Sir complex relocalizes to the rDNA. About 26% of Ty5 insertions occur within the rDNA in sir4-42 strains compared with 3% in wild type. Ty5, therefore, is sensitive to changes in chromatin, indicating that retrotransposons may be useful for dissecting chromatin dynamics that occur during developmental programs such as aging.","Integration; Recombination; Retrotransposon; Silent chromatin; Target specificity","protein sir3p; protein sir4p; transcription factor; unclassified drug; virus protein; aging; article; binding site; chromatin structure; chromosomal localization; gene locus; genotype; nonhuman; priority journal; retroposon; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Alleles; Base Sequence; Chromatin; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Fungal; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal; Fungal Proteins; Gene Deletion; Genes, Fungal; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Recombination, Genetic; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Trans-Activators",,"Chromatin; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal; Fungal Proteins; Retroelements; Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; SIR3 protein, S cerevisiae, 94895-23-5; SIR4 protein, S cerevisiae; Trans-Activators",,,,"Aparicio, O.M., Billington, B.L., Gottschling, D.E., Modifiers of position effect are shared between telomeric and silent mating-type loci in S. cerevisiae (1991) Cell, 66, pp. 1279-1287; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , Greene/Wiley Interscience, New York, NY; Astrom, S.U., Okamura, S.M., Rine, J., Yeast cell-type regulation of DNA repair (1999) Nature, 397, p. 310; Boeke, J.D., Sandmeyer, S.B., Yeast transposable elements (1991) The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, 1, pp. 193-261. , ed.

The immutans (im) variegation mutation of Arabidopsis is nuclear and recessive and results in the production of green- and white-sectored leaves. The green sectors contain cells with normal chloroplasts, whereas the white sectors are heteroplastidic and contain cells with abnormal, pigment-deficient plastids as well as some normal chloroplasts. White sector formation can be promoted by enhanced light intensities, but sectoring becomes irreversible early in leaf development. The white sectors accumulate the carotenoid precursor phytoene. We have positionally cloned IM and found that the gene encodes a 40.5-kD protein with sequence motifs characteristic of alternative oxidase, a mitochondrial protein that functions as a terminal oxidase in the respiratory chains of all plants. However, phylogenetic analyses revealed that the IM protein is only distantly related to these other alternative oxidases, suggesting that IM is a novel member of this protein class. We sequenced three alleles of im, and all are predicted to be null. Our data suggest a model of variegation in which the IM protein functions early in chloroplast biogenesis as a component of a redox chain responsible for phytoene desaturation but that a redundant electron transfer function is capable of compensating for IM activity in some plastids and cells.",,"allele; chloroplast; gene locus; gene sequencing; mitochondrion; oxidase homolog; plant development; plant genetics; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; Chloroplasts; Cloning, Molecular; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Oxidoreductases; Phylogeny; Pigmentation; Plant Leaves; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; IMMUTANS protein, Arabidopsis; Nuclear Proteins; Oxidoreductases, EC 1.-",,,,"Al-Babili, S., Lintig, J.V., Haubruck, H., Beyer, P., A novel, soluble form of phytoene desaturase from Narcissus pseudonarcissus chromoplasts is Hsp70-complexed and competent for flavination, membrane association and enzymatic activation (1996) Plant J., 9, pp. 601-612; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1998) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , New York: Greene Publishing Associates/ Wiley Interscience; Bartley, G.E., Viitanen, P.V., Pecker, I., Chamovitz, D., Hirschberg, J., Scolnik, P.A., Molecular cloning and expression in photosynthetic bacteria of a soybean cDNA coding for phytoene desaturase, an enzyme of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway (1991) Proc.

Ty5 cDNA also recombines with homologous sequences, generating tandem elements or elements that have exchanged markers between cDNA and substrate. In this study, we demonstrate that Ty5 integration depends upon the conserved DD(35)E domain of integrase and cis-acting sequences at the end of the long terminal repeat (LTR) implicated in integrase binding. cDNA recombination requires Rad52p, which is responsible for homologous recombination. Interestingly, Ty5 cDNA recombines at least three times more frequently with substrates in silent chromatin than with a control substrate at an internal chromosomal locus. This preference depends upon the Ty5 targeting domain that is responsible for integration specificity, suggesting that localization of cDNA to silent chromatin results in the enhanced recombination. Recombination with a telomeric substrate occasionally generates highly reiterated Ty5 arrays, and mechanisms for tandem element formation were explored by using a plasmid-based recombination assay. Point mutations were introduced into plasmid targets, and recombination products were characterized to determine recombination initiation sites. Despite our previous observation of the importance of the LTR in forming tandem elements, recombination cannot simply be explained by crossover events between the LTRs of substrate and cDNA. We propose an alternative model based on single-strand annealing, where single-stranded cDNA initiates tandem element formation and the LTR is required for strand displacement to form a looped intermediate. Retrotransposons are increasingly found associated with chromosome ends, and amplification of Ty5 by both integration and recombination exemplifies how retroelements can contribute to telomere dynamics.",,"complementary DNA; fungal DNA; article; chromosome map; DNA recombination; DNA sequence; gene locus; gene targeting; nonhuman; nucleotide repeat; point mutation; priority journal; retroposon; sequence analysis; sequence homology; yeast; Amino Acid Sequence; Chromatin; Crossing Over, Genetic; DNA, Complementary; DNA-Binding Proteins; Genes, Fungal; Integrases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein; Recombination, Genetic; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Telomere; Terminal Repeat Sequences",,"Chromatin; DNA, Complementary; DNA-Binding Proteins; Integrases, EC 2.7.7.-; Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein; RAD52 protein, S cerevisiae; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",,,,"Atwood, A., Lin, J.-H., Levin, H.L., The retrotransposon Tfl assembles virus-like particles that contain excess Gag relative to integrase because of a regulaled degradation process (1996) Mol.

Most retroelements initiate reverse transcription from a host-encoded tRNA primer. DNA synthesis typically extends from the 3'-OH of the acceptor stem, which is complementary to sequences on the retroelement mRNA (the primer binding site, PBS). However, for some retrotransposons, including the yeast Ty5 elements, sequences in the anticodon stem-loop of the initiator methionine tRNA (IMT) are complementary to the PBS. We took advantage of the genetic tractability of the yeast system to investigate the mechanism of Ty5 priming. We found that transposition frequencies decreased at least 800-fold for mutations in the Ty5 PBS that disrupt complementarity with the IMT. Similarly, transposition was reduced at least 200-fold for IMT mutations in the anticodon stem-loop. Base pairing between the Ty5 PBS and IMT is essential for transposition, as compensatory changes that restored base pairing between the two mutant RNAs restored transposition significantly. An analysis of 12 imt mutants with base changes outside of the region of complementarity failed to identify other tRNA residues important for transposition. In addition, assays carried out with heterologous IMTs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that residues outside of the anticodon stem-loop have at most a fivefold effect on transposition. Our genetic system should make it possible to further define the components required for priming and to understand the mechanism by which Ty5's novel primer is generated.","cDNA synthesis; Copia; Priming; Retrotransposition; Retrovirus","transfer RNA; anticodon; Arabidopsis; article; base pairing; nonhuman; priority journal; retroposon; Retrovirus; reverse transcription; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; transcription initiation; virus DNA cell DNA interaction; virus replication; virus transcription; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis thaliana; DNA viruses; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; unidentified retrovirus",,"transfer RNA, 9014-25-9",,,,"Aiyar, A., Cobrinik, D., Ge, Z., Kung, H.J., Leis, J., Interaction between retroviral U5 RNA and the T psi C loop of the tRNA (Trp) primer is required for efficient initiation of reverse transcription (1992) J Virol, 66, pp. 2464-2472; Åström, S.U., Byström, A.S., Rit1, a tRNA backbone-modifying enzyme that mediates initiator and elongator tRNA discrimination (1994) Cell, 79, pp. 535-546; Basavappa, R., Sigler, P.B., The 3 Å crystal structure of yeast initiator tRNA: Functional implications in initiator/elongator discrimination (1991) EMBO J, 10, pp. 3105-3111; Boeke, J.D., Garfinkel, D.J., Styles, C.A., Fink, G.R., Ty elements transpose through an RNA intermediate (1985) Cell, 40, pp. 491-500; Boeke, J.D., Sandmeyer, S.B., Yeast transposable elements (1991) The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, pp. 193-261. , Broach J, Jones E, Pringle J, eds.

In yeast, the Ty5 retrotransposon integrates preferentially within regions bound by silent chromatin, namely the telomeres and the HMR and HML mating loci. A Ty5 mutant (M3) was identified with an approximately 20-fold decrease in targeted integration as measured by a plasmid-based targeting assay. Often chromosomal insertions generated by M3, none were located at the telomeres or silent mating loci. A single amino acid change at the boundary of integrase and reverse transcriptase is responsible for the mutant phenotype. We predict that this mutation lies within a targeting domain that mediates Ty5 target choice by interacting with a component of silent chromatin.",,"integrase; RNA directed DNA polymerase; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; article; chromatin; chromosome; gene expression regulation; genetic recombination; genetics; methodology; molecular genetics; point mutation; retroposon; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence homology; transposon; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Chromatin; Chromosomes, Fungal; DNA Transposable Elements; Integrases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Point Mutation; Recombination, Genetic; Retroelements; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",,"Chromatin; DNA Transposable Elements; Integrases, EC 2.7.7.-; Retroelements; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, EC 2.7.7.49",,,,"Abraham, J., Nasmyth, K.A., Strathern, J.N., Klar, A.J.S., Hicks, J.B., Regulation of mating-type information in yeast: Negative control requiring sequences both 5′ and 3′ to the regulated region (1984) J.

We provide evidence that Tat1 is a retrotransposon and that previously described insertions are solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) left behind after the deletion of coding regions of full-length elements. Three Tat1 insertions were characterized that have retrotransposon features, including a primer binding site complementary to an A. thaliana asparagine tRNA and an open reading frame (ORF) with ~44% amino acid sequence similarity to the gag protein of the Zea mays retrotransposon Zeon-1. Tat 1 elements have large, polymorphic 3' noncoding regions that may contain transduced DNA sequences; a 477-base insertion in the 3' noncoding region of the Tat1-3 element contains part of a related retrotransposon and sequences similar to the nontranslated leader sequence of AT-P5C1, a gene for pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. Analysis of DNA sequences generated by the A. thaliana genome project identified 10 families of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, which share up to 51 and 62% amino-acid similarity to the ORFs of Tat1 and the A. thaliana Athila element, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses resolved tire plant Ty3/gypsy elements into two lineages, one of which includes homologs of Tat1 and Athila. Four families of A. thaliana elements within the Tat/Athila lineage encode a conserved ORF after integrase at a position occupied by the envelope gene in retroviruses and in some insect Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons. Like retroviral envelope genes, this ORF encodes a transmembrane domain and, in some insertions, a putative secretory signal sequence. This suggests that Tat/Athila retrotransposons may produce enveloped virions and may be infectious.",,"dna; gag protein; protein; pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase; arabidopsis; article; binding site; dna sequence; gene; long terminal repeat; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; retroposon; retrovirus; virus envelope; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Conserved Sequence; DNA Primers; Gene Dosage; Genes, Plant; Genome, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Retroelements; Retroviridae; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Viral Envelope Proteins","DDBJ: AF056631, AF056632, AF056633, AF056634; GENBANK: AF056631, AF056632, AF056633, AF056634; AB005247, AB005248, AB007466, AC002294, AC002534, AJ000640, L34658, L35053, M12927, M23367, M32662, M38526, M75723, M77661, U09586, U15406, U60529, U68402, U69258, X01472, X03431, X04132, X13886, X17219, X56645, X59545, X97604, Z11866, Z24451, Z97339, Z97342","DNA Primers; Plant Proteins; Retroelements; Viral Envelope Proteins",,,,"Altschul, S., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E., Lipman, D., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

Eighty-five percent of insertions were solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) or LTR fragments. Overall, retrotransposon sequences constitute > 377 kb or 3.1% of the genome. Independent evolution of retrotransposon sequences was evidenced by the identification of a single-base pair insertion/deletion that distinguishes the highly similar Ty1 and Ty2 LTRs and the identification of a distinct Ty1 subfamily (Ty1'). Whereas Ty1, Ty2, and Ty5 LTRs displayed a broad range of sequence diversity (typically ranging from 70%-99% identity), Ty3 and Ty4 LTRs were highly similar within each element family (most sharing > 96% nucleotide identity). Therefore, Ty3 and Ty4 may be more recent additions to the S. cerevisiae genome and perhaps entered through horizontal transfer or past polyploidization events. Distribution of Ty elements is distinctly nonrandom: 90% of Ty1, 82% of Ty2, 95% of Ty3, and 88% of Ty4 insertions were found within 750 bases of tRNA genes or other genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. tRNA genes are the principle determinant of retrotransposon distribution, and there is, on average, 1.2 insertions per tRNA gene. Evidence for recombination was found near many Ty elements, particularly those not associated with tRNA gene targets. For these insertions, 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences were often duplicated and rearranged among multiple chromosomes, indicating that recombination between retrotransposons can influence genome organization. S. cerevisiae offers the first opportunity to view organizational and evolutionary trends among retrotransposons at the genome level, and we hope our compiled data will serve as a starting point for further investigation and for comparison to other, more complex genomes.",,"RNA polymerase; transfer RNA; article; consensus sequence; controlled study; DNA flanking region; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene rearrangement; gene structure; genetic recombination; genetic transcription; genome; long terminal repeat; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polyploidy; priority journal; retroposon; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; transposon; Fungi; Myxogastria; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"RNA polymerase, 9014-24-8; transfer RNA, 9014-25-9",,,,"Biessmann, H., Mason, J.M., Ferry, K., D'Hulst, M., Valgeirsdottir, K., Traverse, K.L., Pardue, M.L., Addition of telomere-associated HeT DNA sequences ""heals"" broken chromosome ends in Drosophila (1990) Cell, 61, pp. 663-673; Boeke, J.D., Sandmeyer, S.B., Yeast transposable elements (1991) The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast, 1, pp. 193-261. , Saccharomyces (ed.

We found that silent chromatin represses basal Ty5 transcription, indicating that these elements are encompassed by silent chromatin in their native genomic context. Because transcription is a requirement for transposition, integration into silent chromatin would appear to prevent subsequent rounds of replication. Using plasmid-borne Ty5-lacZ constructs, we found that Ty5 expression is haploid specific and is repressed 10-fold in diploid strains. Ty5 transcription is also regulated by the pheromone response pathway and is induced ~ 20-fold upon pheromone treatment. Deletion analysis of the Ty5 LTR promoter revealed that a 33 bp region with three perfect matches to the pheromone response element is responsible for both mating pheromone and cell-type regulation. Transcriptional repression of Ty5 by silent chromatin can be reversed by pheromone treatment, which leads to transcription and transposition. Ty5 replication, therefore, is normally repressed by silent chromatin and appears to be induced during mating. This is the first example of transcriptional activation of a gene that naturally resides within silent chromatin.","Pheromone response pathway; Retrotransposon; Silent chromatin; Telomere Ty5","pheromone; article; cell type; chromatin; controlled study; diploidy; gene construct; gene repression; haploidy; heterochromatin; long terminal repeat; nonhuman; plasmid; priority journal; promoter region; retroposon; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; silent gene; transactivation; transcription regulation; Base Sequence; Chromatin; Diploidy; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Haploidy; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides; Pheromones; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"Chromatin; mating factor, 61194-02-3; Peptides; Pheromones; Retroelements",,,,"Aparicio, O.M., Gottsehling, D.E., Overcoming telomeric silencing: A trans-activator competes to establish gene expression in a cell cycle-dependent way (1994) Genes Dev., 8, pp. 1133-1146; Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , John Wiley and Sons, New York; Bennetzen, J., Schrick, K., Springer, P., Brown, W., San Miguel, P., Active maize genes are unmodified and flanked by diverse classes of modified, highly repetitive DNA (1994) Genome, 37, pp. 565-576; Biessmann, H., Mason, J.M., Ferry, K., D'Hulst, M., Valgeirsdottir, K., Traverse, K.L., Pardue, M.L., Addition of telomere-associated HeT DNA sequences 'heals' broken chromosome ends in Drosophila (1990) Cell, 61, pp. 663-673; Bilanchone, V.W., Claypool, J.A., Kinsey, P.T., Sandmeyer, S.B., Positive and negative regulatory elements control expression of the yeast retrotransposon Ty3 (1993) Genetics, 134, pp. 685-700; Bocke, J.D., Sandmeyer, S.B., Yeast transposable elements (1991) The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, pp. 193-261. , Broach, J., Jones, E.. and Pringle, J.

Recombination is a particularly important pathway for the yeast retrotransposon Ty5 and accounts for ~30% of the putative transposition events when a homologous substrate is carried on a plasmid and ~7% when the substrate is located at the chromosomal URA3 locus. Characterization of recombinants revealed that they are either simple replacements of the marker gene or tandem elements. Using an assay system in which the donor element and recombination substrates are separated, we found that the long terminal repeats (LTRs) are critical for tandem element formation. LTR-containing substrates generate tandem elements at frequencies more than 10-fold higher than similarly sized internal Ty5 sequences. Internal sequences, however, facilitate tandem element formation when associated with an LTR, and there is a linear relationship between frequencies of tandem element formation and the length of LTR-containing substrates. We propose that recombination is initiated between the LTRs of the cDNA and substrate and that internal sequences promote tandem element formation by facilitating sequence alignment. Because of its location in subtelomeric regions, recombinational amplification of Ty5 may contribute to the organization of chromosome ends.",,"complementary dna; integrase; article; chromosome structure; dna recombination; long terminal repeat; marker gene; nonhuman; priority journal; retroposon; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Chromosomes, Fungal; DNA, Complementary; Recombination, Genetic; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"DNA, Complementary; Retroelements",,,,"Ahn, B.-Y., Dornfeld, K.J., Fagrelius, T.J., Livingston, D.M., Effect of limited homology on gene conversion in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasmid recombination system (1988) Mol.

The retrotransposon Ty5 preferentially integrates into regions of silent chromatin, and Ty5 insertions near the HMR-E silencer account for ≃2% of total transposition events. Most Ty5 insertions occur within 800 bp on either side of the autonomously replicating consensus sequence within HMR-E. Ty5 target preference is determined by silent chromatin, because integration near HMR-E is abolished in strains with silencer mutations that alleviate transcriptional repression. The recognition of specific DNA sequences per se does not direct integration, rather, it is the protein complex assembled at the silencers. As demonstrated here for Ty5, recognition of specific chromatin domains may be a general mechanism by which retrotransposons and retroviruses determine integration sites.",,"article; chromatin; dna sequence; gene mutation; priority journal; protein protein interaction; retroposon; retrovirus; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Chromatin; Chromosomes, Fungal; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; unidentified retrovirus",,"Chromatin; Retroelements",,,,"Sandmeyer, S.B., Hansen, L.J., Chalker, D.L., (1990) Annu.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eight of 10 endogenous insertions of the Ty5 retrotransposon family are located within 15 kb of chromosome ends, and two are located near the subtelomeric HMR locus. This genomic organization is the consequence of targeted transposition, as 14 of 15 newly transposed Ty5 elements map to telomeric regions on 10 different chromosomes. Nine of these insertions are within 0.8 kb and three are within 1.5 kb of the autonomously replicating consensus sequence in the subtelomeric X repeat. This suggests that the X repeat plays an important role in directing Ty5 integration. Analysis of endogenous insertions from S.cerevisiae and its close relative S.paradoxus revealed that only one of 12 insertions has target site duplications, indicating that recombination occurs between elements. This is further supported by the observation that Ty5 insertions mark boundaries of sequence duplications and rearrangements in these species. These data suggest that transposable elements like Ty5 can shape the organization of chromosome ends through both transposition and recombination.",,"article; chromosome structure; consensus sequence; gene insertion; gene locus; gene mapping; gene rearrangement; genetic organization; genetic recombination; nonhuman; priority journal; retroposon; saccharomyces cerevisiae; telomere; transposon; Base Sequence; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Fungal; Consensus Sequence; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Fungal; Molecular Sequence Data; Recombination, Genetic; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Retroelements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Telomere; Eukaryota; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae","GENBANK: U19263, U19264","DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Fungal; Retroelements",,,,"Zakian, V.A., (1995) Science, 270, pp. 1601-1607; Blackburn, E., (1992) Annu.

Targeted integration, in turn, likely affects genome organization. In Saccharomyces, native Ty5 retrotransposons are located near telomeres and the silent mating locus HMR. To determine whether this distribution is a consequence of targeted integration, we isolated a transposition-competent Ty5 element from S. paradoxus, a species closely related to S. cerevisiae. This Ty5 element was used to develop a transposition assay in S. cerevisiae to investigate target preference of de novo transposition events. Of 87 independent Ty5 insertions, ~30% were located on chromosome III, indicating this small chromosome (~1/40 of the yeast genome) is a highly preferred target. Mapping of the exact location of 19 chromosome III insertions showed that 18 were within or adjacent to transcriptional silencers flanking HML and HMR or the type X subtelomeric repeat. We predict Ty5 target preference is attributable to interactions between transposition intermediates and constituents of silent chromatin assembled at these sites.

This insertion is .2 kb in length and encodes two overlapping reading frames with similarity to non-LTR retrotransposon proteins, including reverse transcriptase. A polymerase chain reaction assay was developed based on conserved amino acid sequences shared between the Ta11-1 reverse transcriptase and those of non-LTR retrotransposons from other species. Seventeen additional A. thaliana reverse transcriptases were identified that range in nucleotide similarity from 48-88% (Ta12-Ta28). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the A. thaliana sequences are more closely related to each other than to elements from other organisms, consistent with the vertical evolution of these sequences over most of their evolutionary history. One sequence, Ta17, is located in the mitochondrial genome. The remaining are nuclear and of low copy number among 17 diverse A. thaliana ecotypes tested, suggesting that they are not highly active in transposition. The paucity of retrotransposon and the small genome size of A. thaliana support the hypothesis that most repetitive sequences have been lost from the genome and that mechanisms may exist to prevent amplification of extant element families.",,"amino acid; dna; nucleotide; rna directed dna polymerase; amino acid sequence; arabidopsis; article; dna sequence; gene; genome; long terminal repeat; mitochondrion; nonhuman; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; retroposon; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; DNA, Plant; Genome, Plant; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Retroelements; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid","GENBANK: L47175, L47181, L47182, L47183, L47184, L47185, L47186, L47187, L47188, L47189, L47190, L47191, L47192, L47194, L47195, L47289, L47290","ABI3 protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; DNA, Plant; Plant Proteins; Retroelements",,,,"Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York; Bennett, M.D., Smith, J.B., Nuclear DNA amounts in angiospernis (1976) Proc.

The S. cerevisiae strain S288C (or its derivatives) carries eight Ty5 insertions. Six of these are located near the telomeres, and five are found within 500 bp of autonomously replicating sequences present in the type X subtelomeric repeat. The remaining two S. cerevisiae elements are adjacent to the silent mating locus HMR and are located within 500 bp of the origin of replication present in the transcriptional silencer HMR-E. Although the S. cerevisiae Ty5 elements no longer appear capable of transposition, some strains of S. paradoxus have numerous Ty5 insertions, suggesting that transposition is occurring in this species. Most of these elements are adjacent to type X telomeric repeats, and regions flanking four of five characterized S. paradoxus insertions carry autonomously replicating sequences. The genomic organization of the Ty5 elements is in marked contrast to the other S. cerevisiae retrotransposon families (Ty1-4), which are typically located within 500 bp of tRNA genes. For Ty3, this association reflects an interaction between Ty3 and the RNA polymerase III transcription complex, which appears to direct integration [Chalker, D. L. and Sandmeyer, S. B. (1992) Genes Dev. 6, 117-128]. By analogy to Ty3, we predict that Ty5 target choice is specified by interactions with factors present at both the telomeres and HMR that are involved in DNA replication, transcriptional silencing, or the maintenance of the unique chromatin structure at these sites.",,"dna directed rna polymerase iii; dna fragment; article; chromosome rearrangement; dna flanking region; dna replication; dna transcription; gene insertion; gene sequence; nonhuman; priority journal; retroposon; saccharomyces cerevisiae; silent gene; southern blotting; species differentiation; telomere; Base Sequence; DNA Replication; DNA, Fungal; Gene Dosage; Genes, Fungal; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Replication Origin; Retroelements; Saccharomyces; Species Specificity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Telomere; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces paradoxus","GENBANK: U19263, U19264","DNA, Fungal; Plasmids; Retroelements",,,,,"Voytas, D.F.; Department of Zoology and Genetics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, United States",,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,7846079,"English","PROC.

Usually, one or more specific tRNAs, including the primer, are selected and packaged within the virion. The reverse transcriptase (RT) interacts with the primer tRNA and initiates DNA synthesis. The structural and sequence features of primer tRNAs important for these specific interactions are poorly understood. We have developed a genetic assay in which mutants of tRNA(i)/(Met), the primer for the Ty1 retrotransposon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can be tested for the ability to serve as primers in the reverse transcription process. This system allows any tRNA mutant to be tested, regardless of its ability to function in the initiation of protein synthesis. We find that mutations in the TΨC loop and the acceptor stem regions of the tRNA(i)/(Met) affect transposition most severely. Conversely, mutations in the anticodon region have only minimal effects on transposition. Further study of the acceptor stem and other mutants demonstrates that complementarity to the element primer binding site is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for effective tRNA priming. Finally, we have used interspecies hybrid initiator tRNA molecules to implicate nucleotides in the D arm as additional recognition determinants. Ty3 and Ty1, two very distantly related retrotransposons, require similar molecular determinants in this primer tRNA for transposition.",,"cell dna; primer rna; rna directed dna polymerase; transfer rna; article; controlled study; dna synthesis; dna transposition; long terminal repeat; molecular recognition; nonhuman; priority journal; protein synthesis regulation; retroposon; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Retroelements; RNA, Fungal; RNA, Transfer, Met; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Schizosaccharomyces; Structure-Activity Relationship; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"RNA directed DNA polymerase, 37213-50-6, 9068-38-6; transfer RNA, 9014-25-9; DNA Primers; RNA, Fungal; RNA, Transfer, Met; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, 2.7.7.49; Retroelements",,,,"Aiyar, A., Cobrinik, D., Ge, Z., Kung, H.-J., Leis, J., Interaction between retroviral U5 RNA and the TΨC loop of the tRNATrp primer is required for efficient initiation of reverse transcription (1992) J.

The mutation is somatically unstable, and the degree of sectoring is influenced by light and temperature. Whereas the cells in the green sectors contain normal chloroplasts, the cells in the white sectors are heteroplastidic and contain non-pigmented plastids that lack organized lamellar structures, as well as small pigmented plastids and/or rare normal chloroplasts. This indicates that the plastids in im white cells are not affected equally by the nuclear mutation and that the expression of immutans is 'plastid autonomous'. In contrast to other variegation mutants with heteroplastidic cells, the defect in im is not maternally inherited, immutans thus represents a novel type of nuclear gene-induced variegation mutant. It has also been found that the white tissues of immutans accumulate phytoene, a non-colored C40 carotenoid intermediate. This suggests that immutans controls, either directly or indirectly, the activity of phytoene desaturase (PDS), the enzyme that converts phytoene to zeta-carotene in higher plants. However, im is not the structural gene for PDS. A secondary effect of carotenoid deficiency, both in immutans and in wild-type plants treated with a herbicide that blocks carotenoid synthesis, is an increase in acid ribonuclease activity in white tissue. It is concluded that the novel variegation generated by the immutans mutation should offer great insight into the complex circuitry that regulates nuclear - organelle interactions.",,"carotenoid; oxidoreductase; phytoene dehydrogenase; Arabidopsis; article; biosynthesis; cell nucleus; cell organelle; gene; genetics; metabolism; mutation; pigmentation; plastid; ultrastructure; Arabidopsis; Carotenoids; Cell Nucleus; Genes, Plant; Mutation; Organelles; Oxidoreductases; Pigmentation; Plastids; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,"oxidoreductase, 9035-73-8, 9035-82-9, 9037-80-3, 9055-15-6; Carotenoids, 36-88-4; Oxidoreductases, EC 1.; phytoene dehydrogenase, EC 1.-",,,,,"Rodermel, S.R.; Department of Botany, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, United States",,,,,,,,09607412,,PLJUE,7920709,"English","Plant J.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028485772

The sequenced insertions all fell within a few very limited regions of chromosome III. Most of these regions contained tRNA coding regions and/or LTRs of preexisting transposable elements.

These elements are present in high copy number in all three species. Because the two diploid genomic groups have been isolated on opposite sides of the world for 6-11 million years, horizontal transfer of elements between these species is highly unlikely. Elements were intensively sampled to generate a model of copia-like retrotransposable element evolution in systems where vertical transmission is the sole probable means of descent. Copia-like retrotransposon diversity is equally great in all three Gossypium species. Despite this high heterogeneity, analysis of 89 partial reverse transcriptase sequences resulted in the recognition of nine sharply differentiated retrotransposon lineages, each containing elements that share high sequence similarity. No evidence of horizontal transfer from other taxa was obtained. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that element topologies are incongruent with Gossypium phylogeny. Consideration of processes that obscure phylogenetic reconstruction of multigene families (including sampling error, variable degrees of orthology and paralogy, differential lineage age and lineage loss and/or proliferation) demonstrates that incongruence between organismal and retrotransposon trees is expected under conditions in which vertical processes are the sole means of transmission. Identification of closely related elements between species allowed rates of copia-like retrotransposon sequence evolution to be estimated as approximately 10-9 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. These rates are consistent with the interpretation that these retrotransposons have been evolving under functional constraints for most of the time frame bracketed by the species studied. Extrapolation of these results to previous studies that sampled from more highly divergent taxa indicates that horizontal transfer need not be invoked to explain observed phylogenetic patterns. © 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Copia, retrotransposons; Gossypium; Horizontal transmission; Molecular evolution; Orthology; Paralogy; Phylogenetic analysis; Polyploidy; Retrotransposable elements","amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; article; cotton; diploidy; evolution; genetic analysis; phylogeny; phytochemistry; polyploidy; priority journal; transposon; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Comparative Study; DNA Transposable Elements; Drosophila melanogaster; Evolution; Gossypium; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; Plants; Ploidies; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Gossypium; Gossypium herbaceum; Gossypium hirsutum; Gossypium raimondii; Hirsutum",,"DNA Transposable Elements; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, EC 2.7.7.49",,,,,"Wendel, J.F.; Department of Botany, Bessey Hall, Iowa State University, Ames, 50011, IA, United States",,,"Springer-Verlag",,,,,00222844,,JMEVA,7685393,"English","J Mol Evol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027190705

We assessed the phylogenetic distribution of copta-like retrotransposons, a class of transposable element that proliferates by reverse transcription, using a polymerase chain reaction assay designed to detect copia-like element reverse transcriptase sequences. copia-like retrotransposons were identified in 64 plant species as well as the photosynthetic protist Volvox carteri. The plant species included representatives from 9 of 10 plant divisions, including bryophytes, lycopods, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. DNA sequence analysis of 29 cloned PCR products and of a maize retrotransposon cDNA confirmed the identity of these sequences as copia-like reverse transcriptase sequences, thereby demonstrating that this class of retrotransposons is a ubiquitous component of plant genomes.","Molecular evolution; Reverse transcriptase; Transposable element","bryophytes; Eukaryota; Filicophyta; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta; Protista; Volvox carteri; Zea mays; dna; rna directed dna polymerase; article; dna sequence; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; molecular cloning; photosynthesis; phylogeny; plant; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; retroposon; southern blotting; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Comparative Study; DNA; DNA Transposable Elements; Evolution; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Phylogeny; Plants; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retroviridae; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Species Specificity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","GENBANK: M94470, M94471, M94472, M94473, M94474, M94475, M94476, M94477, M94478, M94479, M94480, M94481, M94482, M94483, M94484, M94485, M94486, M94487, M94488, M94489, M94490, M94491, M94492, M94493, M94494, M94495, M94496, M94497, M94498","DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, 9007-49-2; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, EC 2.7.7.49",,,,,"Voytas, D.F.; Department of Botany, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50010, United States",,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,1379734,"English","Proc.

The Ta1 family has been described previously. Two genomic clones representing the Ta2 and Ta3 elements were isolated from an A. thaliana (race Landsberg erecta) λ library using sequences derived from the reverse transcriptase region of Ta1 as hybridization probes. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the Ta1, Ta2 and Ta3 families share >75% amino acid identity in pairwise comparisons of their reverse transcriptase and RNase H genes. In addition to Ta1, Ta2 and Ta3, we identified seven other related retrotransposon families in Landsberg erecta, Ta4-Ta10, using degenerate primers and the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a highly conserved region of retrotransposon-encoded reverse transcriptase. One to two copies of elements Ta2-Ta10 are present in the genomes of the A. thaliana races Landsberg erecta and Columbia indicating that the superfamily comprises at least 0.1% of the A. thaliana genome. The nucleotide sequences of the reverse transcriptase regions of the ten element families place them in the category of copia-like retrotransposons and phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences suggests that horizontal transfer may have played a role in their evolution.",,"primer dna; amino acid sequence; article; multigene family; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant; priority journal; retroposon; reverse transcription; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Blotting, Southern; Cloning, Molecular; Consensus Sequence; DNA Nucleotidyltransferases; DNA Transposable Elements; Endopeptidases; Endoribonucleases; Integrase; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plants; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Restriction Mapping; Ribonuclease H, Calf Thymus; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Transcription, Genetic; Transfection","GENBANK: M31698, M31699, X53972, X53973, X53974, X53975, X53976, X60231, X60232, X60233","DNA Nucleotidyltransferases, EC 2.7.7.-; DNA Transposable Elements; Endopeptidases, EC 3.4.-; Endoribonucleases, EC 3.1.-; Integrase, EC 2.7.7.-; Ribonuclease H, Calf Thymus, EC 3.1.26.4; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, EC 2.7.7.49",,,,,,,,,,,,,00166731,,GENTA,1709409,"English","GENETICS",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025878873

Six Ta1 insertions comprise all of the Ta1 element copies found in three geographically diverse A. thaliana races. These six elements occupy three distinct target sites: Ta1-1 is located on chromosome 5 and is common to all three races (Col-0, Kas-1 and La-0). Ta1-2 is present in two races on chromosome 4 (Kas-1 and La-0), and Ta1-3, also located on chromosome 4, is present only in one race (La-0). The six Ta1 insertions share >96% nucleotide identity, yet are likely to be incapable of further transposition due to deletions or nucleotide changes that alter either the coding capacity of the elements or conserved protein domains required for retrotransposition. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of these elements and the distribution of Ta1 among 12 additional A. thaliana geographical races suggest that Ta1-1 predated the global dispersal of A. thaliana. As the species spread throughout the world, two additional transposition events occurred which gave rise first to Ta1-2 and finally to Ta1-3.",,"amino acid sequence; article; genetic engineering; heredity; higher plant; nonhuman; priority journal; retroposon; transposon; Acyltransferases; Base Sequence; Blotting, Southern; Brassica; Chromosome Mapping; DNA Transposable Elements; Evolution; Molecular Sequence Data; Restriction Mapping; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Arabidopsis thaliana; Embryophyta",,"Acyltransferases, EC 2.3.; DNA Transposable Elements; flavanone synthetase, EC 2.3.1.74",,,,,,,,,,,,,00166731,,GENTA,2174394,"English","GENETICS",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025052373

As transposable elements have greatly facilitated genetic analysis in a variety of species, we have attempted to identify an endogenous A. thaliana transposable element. We report here the discovery of a family of such elements, which we refer to as Ta1 elements. Sequence analysis of one such element shows that it is closely related to retrotransposons and integrated retroviral proviruses, being bound by a direct sequence repeat and having an open reading frame with clear sequence similarity to the polyprotein of the Drosophila melanogaster retrotransposon copia. The sequence of an empty target site of a Ta1 element shows that insertion is accompanied by a five-base-pair target-site duplication and that Ta1 has transposed in the period of time since divergence of two races of A. thaliana. © 1988 Nature Publishing Group.",,"amino acid sequence; animal; article; comparative study; DNA probe; Drosophila melanogaster; genetics; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; nucleic acid hybridization; nucleotide sequence; plant; restriction fragment length polymorphism; Retrovirus; transposon; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Comparative Study; DNA Probes; DNA Transposable Elements; Drosophila melanogaster; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Plants; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Retroviridae; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","GENBANK: X13291","DNA Probes; DNA Transposable Elements",,,,,,,,,,,,,00280836,,,2904123,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024290711
