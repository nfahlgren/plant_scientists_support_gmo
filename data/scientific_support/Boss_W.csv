While phosphoinositides are implicated in cell volume changes and are known to regulate some ion channels, their modulation of aquaporins activity has not yet been reported for any organism. To examine this, we compared the osmotic water permeability (Pf) of protoplasts isolated from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cultured cells (NT1) with different (genetically lowered or elevated relative to controls) levels of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and phosphatidyl inositol [4,5] bisphosphate (PtdInsP2). To achieve this, the cells were transformed with, respectively, the human InsP3 5-phosphatase (‘Ptase cells’) or human phosphatidylinositol (4) phosphate 5-kinase (‘PIPK cells’). The mean Pf of the PIPK cells was several-fold higher relative to that of controls and Ptase cells. Three results favor aquaporins over the membrane matrix as underlying this excessive Pf: (1) transient expression of the maize aquaporin ZmPIP2;4 in the PIPK cells increased Pf by 12–30 μm s−1, while in the controls only by 3–4 μm s−1. (2) Cytosol acidification—known to inhibit aquaporins—lowered the Pf in the PIPK cells down to control levels. (3) The transcript of at least one aquaporin was elevated in the PIPK cells. Together, the three results demonstrate the differences between the PIPK cells and their controls, and suggest a hitherto unobserved regulation of aquaporins by phosphoinositides, which could occur through direct interaction or indirect phosphoinositides-dependent cellular effects. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","BY2;

Here, we targeted two related phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PI4P 5-kinases) PIP5K1 and PIP5K2, which are expressed ubiquitously in Arabidopsis thaliana. A pip5k1 pip5k2 double mutant with reduced PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels showed dwarf stature and phenotypes suggesting defects in auxin distribution. The roots of the pip5k1 pip5k2 double mutant had normal auxin levels but reduced auxin transport and altered distribution. Fluorescence-tagged auxin efflux carriers PIN-FORMED (PIN1)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and PIN2-GFP displayed abnormal, partially apolar distribution. Furthermore, fewer brefeldin A-induced endosomal bodies decorated by PIN1-GFP or PIN2-GFP formed in pip5k1 pip5k2 mutants. Inducible overexpressor lines for PIP5K1 or PIP5K2 also exhibited phenotypes indicating misregulation of auxin-dependent processes, and immunolocalization showed reduced membrane association of PIN1 and PIN2. PIN cycling and polarization require clathrin-mediated endocytosis and labeled clathrin light chain also displayed altered localization patterns in the pip5k1 pip5k2 double mutant, consistent with a role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Further biochemical tests on subcellular fractions enriched for clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) indicated that pip5k1 and pip5k2 mutants have reduced CCV-associated PI4P 5-kinase activity. Together, the data indicate an important role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the control of clathrin dynamics and in auxin distribution in Arabidopsis. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In this report, we demonstrate that the utilization of culture conditions associated with an attenuation of defense responses in monocot plant cells led to highly improved Agrobacterium-mediated transformation efficiencies in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The removal of myo-inositol from the callus culture media in combination with a cold shock pretreatment and the addition of l-Gln prior to and during Agrobacterium-infection resulted in about 84 % of the treated calluses being stably transformed. The omission of myo-inositol from the callus culture media was associated with the failure of certain pathogenesis related genes to be induced after Agrobacterium infection. The addition of a cold shock and supplemental Gln appeared to have synergistic effects on infection and transformation efficiencies. Nearly 60 % of the stably transformed calluses regenerated into green plantlets. Calluses cultured on media lacking myo-inositol also displayed profound physiological and biochemical changes compared to ones cultured on standard growth media, such as reduced lignin within the cell walls, increased starch and inositol hexaphosphate accumulation, enhanced Agrobacterium binding to the cell surface, and less H2O2 production after Agrobacterium infection. Furthermore, the cold treatment greatly reduced callus browning after infection. The simple modifications described in this report may have broad application for improving genetic transformation of recalcitrant monocot species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cold shock; Glutamine; myo-inositol; Plant defense response; Transformation","glutamine; green fluorescent protein; hydrogen peroxide; inositol; lignin; phytic acid; starch; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Arabidopsis; article; cell wall; cold; culture medium; drug effect; gene transfer; gene vector; genetic transformation; genetics; immunology; Lolium; metabolism; physiology; plant immunity; plant root; plant seed; regeneration; rice; tissue culture technique; transgenic plant; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Arabidopsis; Cell Wall; Cold Temperature; Culture Media; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Vectors; Glutamine; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Hydrogen Peroxide; Inositol; Lignin; Lolium; Oryza sativa; Phytic Acid; Plant Immunity; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Regeneration; Seeds; Starch; Tissue Culture Techniques; Transformation, Genetic; Agrobacterium; Lolium perenne; Rhizobium",,"glutamine, 56-85-9, 6899-04-3; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; inositol, 55608-27-0, 6917-35-7, 87-89-8; lignin, 9005-53-2; phytic acid, 83-86-3; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Culture Media; Glutamine, 0RH81L854J; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Hydrogen Peroxide, BBX060AN9V; Inositol, 4L6452S749; Lignin, 9005-53-2; Phytic Acid, 7IGF0S7R8I; Starch, 9005-25-8",,,,"Altpeter, F., Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)

The HsPIP5K-expressing (HK) cells had altered nuclear lipids and nuclear functions. HK cell nuclei had 2-fold increased PIP5K activity and increased steady state PtdIns(4,5)P2. HK nuclear lipid classes showed significant changes compared to NT (wild type) nuclear lipid classes including increased phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and decreased lysolipids. Lipids isolated from protoplast plasma membranes (PM) were also analyzed and compared with nuclear lipids. The lipid profiles revealed similarities and differences in the plasma membrane and nuclei from the NT and transgenic HK cell lines. A notable characteristic of nuclear lipids from both cell types is that PtdIns accounts for a higher mol% of total lipids compared to that of the protoplast PM lipids. The lipid molecular species composition of each lipid class was also analyzed for nuclei and protoplast PM samples. To determine whether expression of HsPIP5K1α affected plant nuclear functions, we compared DNA replication, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in NT and HK cells. The HK cells had a measurable decrease in DNA replication, histone H3K9 acetylation and pRB phosphorylation. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Histone; Phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate; Phospholipids; Plant nuclei; Plasma membrane","phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; phosphatidylserine; phospholipid; article; cell membrane; cell nucleus; metabolism; plant; tobacco; Cell Membrane; Cell Nucleus; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Phosphatidylserines; Phospholipids; Plants; Tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum",,"phosphatidylcholine, 55128-59-1, 8002-43-5; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate, 94161-15-6; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Phosphatidylserines; Phospholipids",,,,"Heilmann, I., Towards understanding the function of stress-inducible PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in plants (2008) Commun.

Attributed to Heraclitus (530-470 BC) From The Story of Philosophy by Will Durant (28) Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, was thinking on a much larger scale than molecular signaling; however, his visionary comments are an important reminder for those studying signaling today. Even in unstimulated cells, signaling pathways are in constant metabolic flux and provide basal signals that travel throughout the organism. In addition, negatively charged phospholipids, such as the polyphosphorylated inositol phospholipids, provide a circuit board of on/off switches for attracting or repelling proteins that define the membranes of the cell. This template of charged phospholipids is sensitive to discrete changes and metabolic fluxes e.g., in pH and cations which contribute to the oscillating signals in the cell. The inherent complexities of a constantly fluctuating system make understanding how plants integrate and process signals challenging. In this review we discuss one aspect of lipid signaling: the inositol family of negatively charged phospholipids and their functions as molecular sensors and regulators of metabolic flux in plants. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

An overview of the current literature indicates the presence of a plant nuclear phosphoinositide (PI) pathway. Inositol phospholipids, inositol phosphates, and enzymes of the PI pathway have been identified in plant nuclei and are implicated in DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, stress responses and hormone signaling. In this review, the potential functions of the nuclear PI pathway in plants are discussed within the context of the animal and yeast literature. It is anticipated that future research will help shed light on the functional significance of the nuclear PI pathway in plants. © 2012 Dieck, Boss and Perera.","Chromatin remodeling; Inositol phosphate; Nucleus; Phosphatidylinositol; Phosphoinositide; Plant; Signaling",,,,,,,"Alcázar-Román, A.R., Tran, E.J., Guo, S., Wente, S.R., Inositol hexakisphosphate and Gle1 activate the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 for nuclear mRNA export (2006) Nat.

The metabolic consequences of this signalling pathway are not known. We reduced the basal level of InsP3 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom) by expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) gene. Transgenic lines producing InsP 5-ptase protein had between 15% and 30% of the basal InsP3 level of control plants. This increased hydrolysis of InsP3 caused dramatic increases in drought tolerance, vegetative biomass and lycopene and hexose concentrations in the fruits. Transcript profiling of root, leaf and fruit tissues identified a small group of genes, including a cell-wall invertase inhibitor gene, that were differentially regulated in all tissues of the InsP 5-ptase expressing plants. Significant differences were found in the amounts of carbohydrates and organic phosphate in these plants. Plants with increased hydrolysis of InsP3 in the cytosol also showed increased net CO2-fixation and sucrose export into sink tissue and storage of hexoses in the source leaves. The increase in biomass was dependent on the supply of inorganic phosphate in the nutrient medium. Uptake and storage of phosphate was increased in the transgene expressing lines. This suggests that in tomato, increased flux through the inositol phosphate pathway uncoupled phosphate sensing from phosphate metabolism. Altering the second messenger, InsP3, revealed multiple coordinated changes in development and metabolism in tomato that have potential for crop improvement. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biomass; Carbohydrate; Drought tolerance; Inositol-(1,4,5) triphosphate; Lycopene; Tomato","carotenoid; hexose; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; lycopene; phosphatase; plant DNA; synaptojanin; article; biomass; carbohydrate metabolism; cytosol; DNA microarray; drought; fruit; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; hydrolysis; metabolism; plant leaf; tomato; transgenic plant; Biomass; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carotenoids; Cytosol; DNA, Plant; Droughts; Fruit; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hexoses; Humans; Hydrolysis; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Lycopersicon esculentum; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Lycopersicon esculentum; Solanum",,"hexose, 93780-23-5; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate, 85166-31-0, 88269-39-0; lycopene, 502-65-8; phosphatase, 9013-05-2; synaptojanin, 119699-77-3; Carotenoids, 36-88-4; DNA, Plant; Hexoses; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, 85166-31-0; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, 3.1.3.-; inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, 3.1.3.56; lycopene, 502-65-8",,,,"Berdy, S.E., Kudla, J., Gruissem, W., Gillaspy, G.E., Molecular characterization of At5PTase1, an inositol phosphatase capable of terminating inositol trisphosphate signaling (2001) Plant Physiol., 126, pp. 801-810; (1974) Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, 3. , Bergmeyer, H.U. ed.

This study showed a positive correlation between blue light induced increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and blue light-mediation of prehaustoria development, prior to host attachment. Blue light induced a significant increase in the level of IP3, with a peak at about 30 min. Thereafter, the level of IP3 declined to the resting value after 2 h of blue light. Irradiation with 10 min red light pulse applied directly at the end of each 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 1, 2 and 4 h blue light significantly reduced IP3, while high levels of IP3 were observed after 10 min far-red pulse. The G-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin inhibited prehaustoria developed under blue light, suggesting that receptor-coupled G-proteins are likely to be involved in prehaustoria development. These results are the first in vivo demonstration of a possible role for IP3 as a second messenger in the blue light signal transduction process in prehaustoria development in Cuscuta. © 2009 European Weed Research Society.","Blue light; Cryptochromes; Field dodder; G-proteins; Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3; Phytochromes","biochemical composition; carbohydrate; dicotyledon; light effect; phytochemistry; protein; seedling; Cuscuta; Cuscuta campestris",,,,,,"Alexandre, J., Lassaless, J.P., Kado, R.T., Opening of Ca2+ channels in isolated red beet root vacuole membrane by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (1990) Nature, 343, pp. 567-570; Assmann, S.M., Heterotrimeric and unconventional GTO binding proteins in plant cell signaling (2002) Plant Cell, 14, pp. 355-373; Dawson, J., Musselman, L.J., Wolswinkel, P., Dorr, I., Biology and control of Cuscuta (1994) Review Weed Science, 6, pp. 265-317; Drøbak, B.K., The plant phosphoinositide system (1992) Biochemical Journal, 288, pp. 697-712; Haidar, M.A., Characterization of the interaction between cryptochromes and phytochromes in blue light-induced coiling and prehaustoria development of dodder (Cuscuta campestris) seedlings (2003) Annals of Applied Biology, 143, pp. 57-62; Haidar, M.A., Orr, G.L., The response of Cuscuta planiflora seedlings to red and far-red, blue light and end-of-day irradiations (1999) Annals of Applied Biology, 134, pp. 117-120; Haidar, M.A., Orr, G.L., Westra, P., Effects of light and mechanical stimulation on coiling and prehaustoria formation in Cuscuta spp (1997) Weed Research, 37, pp. 219-228; Kim, H.Y., Cot, G.G., Crain, R.C., Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate may mediate closure of K+ channels by light and darkness in Samanea saman motor cells (1996) Planta, 198, pp. 279-287; Koornneef, M., Kendrick, R.E., Photomorphogenic mutants of higher plants (1994) Photomorphogenesis in Plants, pp. 601-628. , In. eds.

Like other aerobic organisms, plants have ROS-scavenging enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), which removes superoxide anion radical (O22--) and prevents the production and buildup of toxic free radicals. However, increasing the expression of cytosolic SODs is complex, and increasing their production in vivo has proven to be challenging. To avoid problems with endogenous regulation of gene expression, we expressed a gene from the archaeal hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus that reduces O22-. P. furiosus uses superoxide reductase (SOR) rather than SOD to remove superoxide. SOR is a thermostable enzyme that reduces O22- in a one-electron reduction without producing oxygen. We show that P. furiosus SOR can be produced as a functional enzyme in planta and that plants producing SOR have enhanced tolerance to heat, light, and chemically induced ROS. Stress tolerance in the SOR-producing plants correlates positively with a delayed increase in ROS-sensitive transcripts and a decrease in ascorbate peroxidase activity. The SOR plants provide a good model system to study the impact of cytosolic ROS on downstream signaling in plant growth and development. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that this synthetic approach for reducing cytosolic ROS holds promise as a means for improving stress tolerance in crop plants. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Arabidopsis protein;

Smith Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot 76100, Israel","In the animal world, the regulation of ion channels by phosphoinositides (PIs) has been investigated extensively, demonstrating a wide range of channels controlled by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate (PtdInsP2). To understand PI regulation of plant ion channels, we examined the in planta effect of PtdInsP2 on the K+-efflux channel of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), NtORK (outward-rectifying K channel). We applied a patch clamp in the whole-cell configuration (with fixed ""cytosolic"" Ca 2+ concentration and pH) to protoplasts isolated from cultured tobacco cells with genetically manipulated plasma membrane levels of PtdInsP2 and cellular inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate: ""Low PIs"" had depressed levels of these PIs, and ""High PIs"" had elevated levels relative to controls. In all of these cells, K channel activity, reflected in the net, steady-state outward K+ currents (I K), was inversely related to the plasma membrane PtdInsP2 level. Consistent with this, short-term manipulations decreasing PtdInsP 2 levels in the High PIs, such as pretreatment with the phytohormone abscisic acid (25 μM) or neutralizing the bath solution from pH 5.6 to pH 7, increased IK (i.e. NtORK activity). Moreover, increasing PtdInsP 2 levels in controls or in abscisic acid-treated high-PI cells, using the specific PI-phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (2.5-4 μM), decreased NtORK activity. In all cases, IK decreases stemmed largely from decreased maximum attainable NtORK channel conductance and partly from shifted voltage dependence of channel gating to more positive potentials, making it more difficult to activate the channels. These results are consistent with NtORK inhibition by the negatively charged PtdInsP2 in the internal plasma membrane leaflet. Such effects are likely to underlie PI signaling in intact plant cells. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"abscisic acid; calcium; Drosophila protein; Ork1 protein, Drosophila; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate;

To determine the downstream consequences of altered InsP3-mediated signaling, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the mammalian type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), which specifically hydrolyzes soluble inositol phosphates and terminates the signal. Rapid transient Ca2+ responses to a cold or salt stimulus were reduced by ∼30% in these transgenic plants. Drought stress studies revealed, surprisingly, that the InsP 5-ptase plants lost less water and exhibited increased drought tolerance. The onset of the drought stress was delayed in the transgenic plants, and abscisic acid (ABA) levels increased less than in the wild-type plants. Stomatal bioassays showed that transgenic guard cells were less responsive to the inhibition of opening by ABA but showed an increased sensitivity to ABA-induced closure. Transcript profiling revealed that the drought-inducible ABA-independent transcription factor DREB2A and a subset of DREB2A-regulated genes were basally upregulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants, suggesting that InsP3 is a negative regulator of these DREB2A-regulated genes. These results indicate that the drought tolerance of the InsP 5-ptase plants is mediated in part via a DREB2A-dependent pathway and that constitutive dampening of the InsP3 signal reveals unanticipated interconnections between signaling pathways. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"abscisic acid; calcium; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 5 phosphatase; inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase; phosphatase; water; animal; Arabidopsis; article; DNA microarray; drought; drug effect; gene expression profiling; genetics; metabolism; physiology; signal transduction; transgenic plant; Abscisic Acid; Animals; Arabidopsis; Calcium; Droughts; Gene Expression Profiling; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Plants, Genetically Modified; Signal Transduction; Water; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Mammalia",,"abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; calcium, 7440-70-2; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 5 phosphatase, 106283-14-1; phosphatase, 9013-05-2; water, 7732-18-5; Abscisic Acid, 21293-29-8; Calcium, 7440-70-2; inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase, EC 3.1.3.56; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, EC 3.1.3.-; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Agarwal, P., Agarwal, P.K., Nair, S., Sopory, S.K., Reddy, M.K., Stress-inducible DREB2A transcription factor from Pennisetum glaucum is a phosphoprotein and its phosphorylation negatively regulates its DNA-binding activity (2007) Mol.

AtPI4Kγ4 and AtPI4Kγ7 undergo autophosphorylation and phosphorylate serine/threonine residues of protein substrates, but have no detectable lipid kinase activity. AtPI4Kγ4 and AtPI4Kγ7 are members of a subset of five putative AtPI4Ks that contain N-terminal UBL (ubiquitin-like) domains. In vitro analysis of AtPI4Kγ4 indicates that it interacts directly with, and phosphorylates, two proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, namely UFD1 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 1) and RPN10 (regulatory particle non-ATPase 10). On the basis of the present results, we propose that AtPI4Kγ4 and AtPI4Kγ7 should be designated UbDKγ4 and UbDKγ7 (ubiquitin-like domain kinases γ4 and γ7). These UBL-domain-containing AtPI4Ks correspond to a new PIKK subfamily of protein kinases. Furthermore, UFD1 and RPN10 phosphorylation represents an additional mechanism by which their function can be regulated. © The Authors.","Phosphoinositide kinase (PIK); Phosphorylation; Proteasome regulatory particle non-ATPase 10 subunit (proteasome RPN10 subunit); Protein kinase; Ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD); Ubiquitin-like domain (UBL domain)","Phosphoinositide kinase (PIK); Protein kinases; Ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD); Ubiquitin-like domain (UBL domain); Catalysis; Enzyme activity; Gene encoding; Phosphorylation; Enzyme kinetics; adenosine triphosphatase; lipid; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoinositide 4 kinase; proteasome; protein kinase; protein serine threonine kinase; ubiquitin; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis protein; complementary DNA; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4 kinase; phosphatidylinositol-3,4 kinase; protein kinase; recombinant protein; RPN10 protein, Arabidopsis; signal transducing adaptor protein; ubiquitin; amino terminal sequence; Arabidopsis; article; autophosphorylation; catalysis; enzyme activity; genetic code; in vitro study; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein domain; protein family; protein function; protein interaction; protein phosphorylation; Arabidopsis; chemistry; classification; gene vector; human; metabolism; molecular cloning; phosphorylation; phylogeny; protein tertiary structure; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Catalysis; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Genetic Vectors; Humans; Phosphorylation; Phylogeny; Protein Kinases; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Proteins; Ubiquitin","GENBANK: U09430, U09559, U15117, U15332, U16922, U22122, U60768","adenosine triphosphatase, 37289-25-1, 9000-83-3; lipid, 66455-18-3; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; proteasome, 140879-24-9; protein kinase, 9026-43-1; ubiquitin, 60267-61-0; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, 2.7.1.137; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Arabidopsis Proteins; DNA, Complementary; Protein Kinases, 2.7.1.37; RPN10 protein, Arabidopsis; Recombinant Proteins; Ubiquitin; phosphatidylinositol-3,4 kinase, 2.7.1.-",,,,"Abraham, R.T., PI 3-kinase related kinases: 'big' players in stress-induced signaling pathways (2004) DNA Repair, 3, pp. 883-887; Balla, A., Balla, T., Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases: Old enzymes with emerging (unctions (2006) Trends Cell Biol, 16, pp. 351-361; Fruman, D.A., Meyers, R.E., Cantley, L.C., Phosphoinositide kinases (1998) Ann.

In animals the phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) are associated with the cytoskeleton through a scaffold of proteins; however, in plants such an interaction was not clear. Our approach was to determine which of the plant PIPKs interact with actin and determine whether the PIPK-actin interaction is direct. Our results indicate that AtPIPK1 interacts directly with actin and that the binding is mediated through a predicted linker region in the lipid kinase. AtPIPK1 also recruits AtPI4Kβ1 to the cytoskeleton. Recruitment of AtPI4Kβ1 to F-actin was dependent on the C-terminal catalytic domain of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase but did not require the presence of the N-terminal 251 amino acids, which includes 7 putative membrane occupation and recognition nexus motifs. In vivo studies confirm the interaction of plant lipid kinases with the cytoskeleton and suggest a role for actin in targeting PIPKs to the membrane.",,"Actin cytoskeleton; F-actin; Nexus motifs; Phosphatidylinositol; Amino acids; Binding sites; Membranes; Phosphates; Phospholipids; Proteins; Scaffolds; Enzyme activity; enzyme; F actin; phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase beta1; phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase 1; unclassified drug; 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; actin; Arabidopsis protein; glutathione transferase; hybrid protein; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase; phosphatidylinositol kinase; phosphotransferase; PIPK10 protein, Arabidopsis; polyphosphoinositide; amino terminal sequence; Arabidopsis; article; carboxy terminal sequence; cytoskeleton; in vivo study; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein protein interaction; Arabidopsis; cytoskeleton; enzymology; genetics; immunoblotting; mass spectrometry; metabolism; Animalia; Arabidopsis; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase; Actins; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cytoskeleton; Glutathione Transferase; Immunoblotting; Mass Spectrometry; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Recombinant Fusion Proteins",,"F actin, 39409-31-9; glutathione transferase, 50812-37-8; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase, 9032-61-5; phosphatidylinositol kinase, 37205-54-2; phosphotransferase, 9031-09-8, 9031-44-1; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase, 2.7.1.67; 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, 2.7.1.68; Actins; Arabidopsis Proteins; Glutathione Transferase, 2.5.1.18; PIPK10 protein, Arabidopsis, 2.7.1.68; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), 2.7.1.-; Recombinant Fusion Proteins",,,,"Mueller-Roeber, B., Pical, C., (2002) Plant Physiol, 130, pp. 22-46; Hinchliffe, K.A., Ciruela, A., Irvine, R.F., (1998) Biochim.

Expressing human PIPKIα in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells increased plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 100-fold. In vivo studies revealed that the rate of 32Pi incorporation into whole-cell PtdIns(4,5)P2 increased &gt;12-fold, and the ratio of [ 3H]PtdInsP2 to [3H]PtdInsP increased 6-fold, but PtdInsP levels did not decrease, indicating that PtdInsP biosynthesis was not limiting. Both [3H]inositol trisphosphate and [ 3H]inositol hexakisphosphate increased 3-and 1.5-fold, respectively, in the transgenic lines after 18 h of labeling. The inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] binding assay showed that total cellular Ins(1,4,5)P3/g fresh weight was &gt;40-fold higher in transgenic tobacco lines; however, even with this high steady state level of Ins(1,4,5)P3, the pathway was not saturated. Stimulating transgenic cells with hyperosmotic stress led to another 2-fold increase, suggesting that the transgenic cells were in a constant state of PI stimulation. Furthermore, expressing Hs PIPKIα increased sugar use and oxygen uptake. Our results demonstrate that PIPK is flux limiting and that this high rate of PI metabolism increased the energy demands in these cells. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Biosynthesis; Cell membranes; Metabolism; Plants (botany); Phosphoinositide metabolism; Transgenic lines; Genetic engineering; calcium; green fluorescent protein; hybrid protein; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; tritium; vegetable protein; article; basal metabolic rate; biosynthesis; cell fractionation; cell membrane; cell respiration; cytology; enzymology; genetics; human; lipid metabolism; metabolism; protein transport; tobacco; transgenic plant; Basal Metabolism; Calcium; Cell Membrane; Cell Respiration; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Lipid Metabolism; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Protein Transport; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Subcellular Fractions; Tobacco; Tritium; Biosynthesis; Cells; Genetic Engineering; Metabolism; Plants; Nicotiana tabacum","GENBANK: NM_003557","calcium, 7440-70-2; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate, 85166-31-0, 88269-39-0; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate, 94161-15-6; tritium, 10028-17-8; Calcium, 7440-70-2; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, 85166-31-0; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Plant Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Tritium, 10028-17-8",,,,"Adel-Latif, A.A., Smith, J.P., Akhtar, R.A., Polyphosphoinositides and muscarinic chloinergic and β-adrenergic receptors in iris smooth muscle (1985) Inositol and Phosphoinositides: Metabolism and Regulation, pp. 275-298. , J.E.

These MORN motifs are not found in PIPKs from other eukaryotes. To understand the impact of the additional N-terminal domain on protein function and subcellular distribution, we expressed truncated and full-length versions of AtPIPK1, one member of this family of PIPKs, in Escherichia coli and in tobacco cells grown in suspension culture. Deletion of the N-terminal MORN domain (amino acids 1-251) of AtPIPK1 increased the specific activity of the remaining C-terminal peptide (ΔMORN) &gt;4-fold and eliminated activation by phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). PtdOH activation could also be eliminated by mutating Pro396 to Ala (P396A) in the predicted linker region between the MORN and the kinase homology domains. AtPIPK1 is product-activated and the MORN domain binds PtdIns(4,5)P2. Adding back the MORN peptide to ΔMORN or to the PtdOH-activated full-length protein increased activity ∼2-fold. Furthermore, expressing the MORN domain in vivo increased the plasma membrane PtdInsP kinase activity. When cells were exposed to hyperosmotic stress, the MORN peptide redistributed from the plasma membrane to a lower phase or endomembrane fraction. In addition, endogenous PtdInsP kinase activity increased in the endomembrane fraction of hyperosmotically stressed cells. We conclude that the MORN peptide can regulate both the function and distribution of the enzyme in a manner that is sensitive to the lipid environment. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Endomembrane fractions; Eukaryotes; Hyperosmotic stress; Phosphatidic acids; Amino acids; Cell membranes; Escherichia coli; Peptides; Enzyme activity; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase; Arabidopsis protein; lipid; phosphatidylinositol phosphate 4 kinase; phosphatidylinositol phosphate 4-kinase; phosphotransferase; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis; article; cell membrane; cellular distribution; controlled study; enzyme activity; Escherichia coli; hyperosmotic stress; nonhuman; plant cell; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; protein function; tobacco; Arabidopsis; cell membrane; enzymology; genetics; metabolism; protein motif; protein tertiary structure; Arabidopsis; Escherichia coli; Eukaryota; Nicotiana tabacum; Amino Acid Motifs; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Membrane; Escherichia coli; Lipids; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Protein Structure, Tertiary; Tobacco",,"phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase, 9032-61-5; lipid, 66455-18-3; phosphotransferase, 9031-09-8, 9031-44-1; Arabidopsis Proteins; Lipids; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), 2.7.1.-; phosphatidylinositol phosphate 4-kinase, 2.7.1.-",,,,"Mueller-Roeber, B., Pical, C., (2002) Plant Physiol, 130, pp. 22-46; Ma, H., Xu, S.P., Luo, D., Xu, Z.H., Xue, H.W., (2004) Plant Mol.

However, at present, the contribution of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in plant gravitropism is not well understood. To delineate the role of InsP3 in plant gravitropism, we generated Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes InsP3. The transgenic plants show no significant differences in growth and life cycle compared to wild-type plants, although basal InsP3 levels are reduced by greater than 90% compared to wild-type plants. With gravistimulation, InsP3 levels in inflorescence stems of transgenic plants show no detectable change, whereas in wild-type plant inflorescences, InsP3 levels increase approximately 3-fold within the first 5 to 15 min of gravistimulation, preceding visible bending. Furthermore, gravitropic bending of the roots, hypocotyls, and inflorescence stems of the InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants is reduced by approximately 30% compared with the wild type. Additionally, the cold memory response of the transgenic plants is attenuated, indicating that InsP 3 contributes to gravisignaling in the cold. The transgenic roots were shown to have altered calcium sensitivity in controlling grayitropic response, a reduction in basipetal indole-3-acetic acid transport, and a delay in the asymmetric auxin-induced β-glucuronidase expression with gravistimulation as compared to the controls. The compromised gravitropic response in all the major axes of growth in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants reveals a universal role for InsP3 in the gravity signal transduction cascade of plants. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Enzymes; Growth kinetics; Organic compounds; Gravistimulation; Gravitropism; Inflorescences; Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Plants (botany); Enzymes; Growth; Organic Compounds; Plants; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; indoleacetic acid derivative; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 5 phosphatase; inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase; phosphatase; Arabidopsis; article; genetics; gravitropism; growth, development and aging; histology; human; hydrolysis; metabolism; molecular genetics; physiology; plant; plant root; reporter gene; signal transduction; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Genes, Reporter; Gravitropism; Humans; Hydrolysis; Indoleacetic Acids; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Signal Transduction","GENBANK: X77567, X77567","inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate, 85166-31-0, 88269-39-0; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 5 phosphatase, 106283-14-1; phosphatase, 9013-05-2; Indoleacetic Acids; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, 85166-31-0; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, 3.1.3.-; inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase, 3.1.3.56",,,,"Bechtold, N., Pelletier, G., In planta Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of adult Arabidopsis thaliana plants by vacuum infiltration (1998) Methods Mol Biol, 82, pp. 259-266; Berdy, S.E., Kudla, J., Gruissem, W., Gillaspy, G.E., Molecular characterization of At5PTase1, an inositol phosphatase capable of terminating inositol trisphosphate signaling (2001) Plant Physiol, 126, pp. 801-810; Blancaflor, E.B., Masson, P.H., Plant gravitropism.

When produced as a fusion protein with the green fluorescent protein in plant cells, P. furiosus SOR is located in the cytosol and nucleus. The recombinant SOR enzyme retains its function and heat stability when assayed in vitro. Importantly, expressing SOR in plant cells enhances their survival at high temperature indicating that it functions in vivo. The archaeal SOR provides a novel mechanism to reduce superoxide and demonstrates the potential for using archaeal genes to alter eukaryotic metabolism. © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.","Archaeal; Heat-stress; Hyperthermophile; Plant; Reactive oxygen species; Superoxide dismutase; Superoxide reductase","green fluorescent protein; hybrid protein; oxidoreductase; recombinant protein; superoxide; superoxide reductase; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; article; cell metabolism; cell nucleus; cell survival; controlled study; cytosol; enzyme stability; enzyme synthesis; eukaryotic cell; heat; heat tolerance; high temperature; in vitro study; nonhuman; plant cell; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; Pyrococcus furiosus; reduction; thermostability; Archaeal Proteins; Cells, Cultured; Cytoplasm; Enzyme Stability; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Heat; Oxidoreductases; Plants, Genetically Modified; Pyrococcus furiosus; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Superoxides; Tobacco; Archaea; Eukaryota; Pyrococcus furiosus",,"oxidoreductase, 9035-73-8, 9035-82-9, 9037-80-3, 9055-15-6; superoxide, 11062-77-4; Archaeal Proteins; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Oxidoreductases, EC 1.-; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; superoxide reductase, EC 1.-; Superoxides, 11062-77-4",,,,"Foyer, C.H., Noctor, G., Oxidant and antioxidant signalling in plants: A re-evaluation of the concept of oxidative stress in a physiological context (2005) Plant Cell Environ., 28, pp. 1056-1071; Apel, K., Hirt, H., Reactive oxygen species: Metabolism, oxidative stress, and signal transduction (2004) Annu.

AtPIPK10 has the same Km, but a 10-fold lower V max than AtPIPK1 and it is insensitive to phosphatidic acid. AtPIPK10 transcript is most abundant in inflorescence stalks and flowers, whereas AtPIPK1 transcript is present in all tissues. Comparative analysis of recombinant AtPIPK10 and AtPIPK1 with recombinant HsPIPKIα reveals that the Arabidopsis enzymes have roughly 200- and 20-fold lower V max/Km, respectively.

In addition to being involved in the regulation of cellular Ca 2+, calreticulin is a key quality control element during protein folding in the ER lumen. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) suspension cells overexpressing a maize CRT (CRT1a) were used here to examine the properties of CRT in growing plant cells with respect to stress exposure. The endogenous CRT gene was induced rapidly after subculturing of the cells to new medium. In accordance, the CRT protein levels increased, peaking at days 3-4. At day 5, when the CRT transcript levels had levelled off, a further increase in endogenous CRT expression was obtained when the cells were treated with excess Ca2+ or the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Whereas the response to Ca2+ occurred within 30 min, the induction by tunicamycin took several hours to be established. Transforming tobacco cells with maize CRT1a, under a constitutive mannopine synthase promoter, resulted in a stable level of expressed CRT1a during the growth cycle compared with endogenous CRT. The CRTs showed differences in attached glycans, but both contained the high mannose-rich-type glycans characteristic of ER proteins. In agreement with an ER location, both tobacco CRT and the transgene product CRT1a codistributed with the ER marker NADH cytochrome c reductase after density gradient centrifugation of microsomal fractions from tobacco cells. Increased production of CRT, as was obtained in the transgenic tobacco cell lines, made cells more tolerant than wild-type cells to high Ca2+ during growth.

Rapid, transient changes in the relative abundance of specific transcripts occurred in response to gravity or mechanical stimulation, and these transcript level changes reveal clusters of coordinated events. Transcriptional regulation occurs in the root apices within less than 2 min after either stimulus. We identified genes responding specifically to each stimulus as well as transcripts regulated in both signal transduction pathways.

However, major limitations for in vitro studies of recombinant lipid kinases are the low specific activity and instability of the purified proteins. Our goal was to determine if cyclodextrins would provide an effective substrate delivery system and enhance the specific activity of lipid kinases. For these studies, we have used recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase 1 (AtPIPK1). AtPIPK1 was produced as a fusion protein with glulathione-S-transferase and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. A comparison of lipid kinase activity using substrate prepared in α-, β-, or γ-cyclodextrin indicated that β-cyclodextrin was most effective and enhanced lipid kinase activity 6-fold compared with substrate prepared in Triton X-100-mixed micelles. We have optimized reaction conditions and shown that product can be recovered from the cyclodextrin-treated recombinant protein, which reveals a potential method for automating the assay for pharmacological screening.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Automated assay; Inositol lipids","alpha cyclodextrin; beta cyclodextrin; cyclodextrin; gamma cyclodextrin; glutathione; glutathione transferase; hybrid protein; inositol lipid kinase; lipid; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase; protein; recombinant lipid kinase; recombinant phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; recombinant protein; sepharose; triton x 100; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis; article; enzyme activity; in vitro study; micelle; nonhuman; priority journal; NASA Discipline Plant Biology; Non-NASA Center; Arabidopsis; Cyclodextrins; Enzyme Activation; Microsomes; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Recombinant Proteins",,"alpha cyclodextrin, 10016-20-3; beta cyclodextrin, 7585-39-9; cyclodextrin, 12619-70-4; gamma cyclodextrin, 17465-86-0; glutathione transferase, 50812-37-8; glutathione, 70-18-8; lipid, 66455-18-3; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase, 9032-61-5; protein, 67254-75-5; sepharose, 61970-08-9; 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, EC 2.7.1.68; Cyclodextrins; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), EC 2.7.1.-; Recombinant Proteins",,,,"Hurley, J.H., Tsujishita, Y., Pearson, M.A., Floundering about at cell membranes: A structural view of phospholipid signaling (2000) Curr.

Here, we present the first analysis, to our knowledge, of evolutionary diversity and expression profiling among different plant CRT isoforms. Phylogenetic studies and expression analysis show that higher plants contain two distinct groups of CRTs: a CRT1/CRT2 group and a CRT3 group. To corroborate the existence of these isoform groups, we cloned a putative CRT3 ortholog from Brassica rapa. The CRT3 gene appears to be most closely related to the ancestral CRT gene in higher plants. Distinct tissue-dependent expression patterns and stress-related regulation were observed for the isoform groups. Furthermore, analysis of posttranslational modifications revealed differences in the glycosylation status among members within the CRT1/CRT2 isoform group. Based on evolutionary relationship, a new nomenclature for plant CRTs is suggested. The presence of two distinct CRT isoform groups, with distinct expression patterns and posttranslational modifications, supports functional specificity among plant CRTs and could account for the multiple functional roles assigned to CRTs.",,"Cells; Genes; Proteins; Calreticulin (CRT); Plants (botany); Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Calreticulin; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Profiling; Glycosylation; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Isoforms; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Zea mays; Brassica; Brassica rapa; Embryophyta; Eukaryota","GENBANK: AY336743","Calreticulin; DNA, Complementary; Plant Proteins; Protein Isoforms",,,,"Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Arnaudeau, S., Frieden, M., Nakamura, K., Castelbou, C., Michalak, M., Demaurex, N., Calreticulin differentially modulates calcium uptake and release in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (2002) J Biol Chem, 277, pp. 46696-46705; Baksh, S., Michalak, M., Expression of calreticulin in Escherichia coli and identification of its Ca2+ binding domains (1991) J Biol Chem, 266, pp. 21458-21465; Baldan, B., Navazio, L., Friso, A., Mariani, P., Meggio, F., Plant calreticulin is specifically and efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (1996) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 221, pp. 498-502; Baluska, F., Samaj, J., Napier, R., Volkmann, D., Maize calreticulin localizes preferentially to plasmodesmata in root apex (1999) Plant J, 19, pp. 481-488; Borisjuk, N., Sitailo, L., Adler, K., Malysheva, L., Tewes, A., Borisjuk, L., Manteuffel, R., Calreticulin expression in plant cells: Developmental regulation, tissue specificity and intracellular distribution (1998) Planta, 206, pp. 504-514; Bremer, K., Gondwanan evolution of the grass alliance of families (Poales) (2002) Evol Int J Org Evolution, 56, pp. 1374-1387; Camacho, P., Lechleiter, J.D., Calreticulin inhibits repetitive intracellular Ca2+ waves (1995) Cell, 82, pp. 765-771; Chen, F., Hayes, P.M., Mulrooney, D.M., Pan, A., Identification and characterization of cDNA clones encoding plant calreticulin in barley (1994) Plant Cell, 6, pp. 835-843; Corbett, E.F., Michalak, K.M., Oikawa, K., Johnson, S., Campbell, I.D., Eggleton, P., Kay, C., Michalak, M., The conformation of calreticulin is influenced by the endoplasmic reticulum luminal environment (2000) J Biol Chem, 275, pp. 27177-27185; Coughlan, S.J., Hastings, C., Winfrey Jr., R., Cloning and characterization of the calreticulin gene from Ricinus communis L.

We also explore the role of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in regulating AtPI4Kα1. Recombinant kinase activity was found to be differentially sensitive to PtdIns-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), the product of the reaction. The specific activity of AtPI4Kα1 was inhibited 70% by 0.5 mM PtdIns4P. The effect of PtdIns4P was not simply due to charge because AtPI4Kα1 activity was stimulated approximately 50% by equal concentrations of the other negatively charged lipids, PtdIns3P, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidyl-serine. Furthermore, inhibition of AtPI4Kα1 by PtdIns4P could be alleviated by adding recombinant AtPI4Kα1 PH domain, which selectively binds to PtdIns4P (Stevenson et al., 1998). In contrast, the specific activity of AtPI4Kβ1, which does not have a PH domain, was stimulated 2-fold by PtdIns4P but not other negatively charged lipids. Visualization of green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in insect cells revealed that AtPI4Kα1 was associated primarily with membranes in the perinuclear region, whereas AtPI4Kβ1 was in the cytosol and associated with small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. Expression of AtPI4Kα1 without the PH domain in the insect cells compromised PtdIns 4-kinase activity and caused mislocalization of the kinase. The green fluorescent protein-PH domain alone was associated with intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane. In vitro, the PH domain appeared to be necessary for association of AtPI4Kα1 with fine actin filaments. These studies support the idea that the Arabidopsis type III PtdIns 4-kinases are responsible for distinct phosphoinositide pools.",,"Animal cell culture; Cell membranes; Enzyme inhibition; Enzyme kinetics; Fluorescence; Growth kinetics; Lipids; pH effects; Proteins; Homology; Plasma membranes; Plant cell culture; Non-programmatic; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase; Amino Acid Sequence; Androstadienes; Animals; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Cell Line; DNA Primers; Enzyme Inhibitors; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Isoenzymes; Kinetics; Luminescent Proteins; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Sequence Deletion; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Spodoptera; Transfection; Animalia; Arabidopsis; Insecta; Spodoptera; Spodoptera frugiperda",,"1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase, EC 2.7.1.67; Androstadienes; DNA Primers; Enzyme Inhibitors; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Isoenzymes; Luminescent Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; wortmannin, 19545-26-7",,,,"Audhya, A., Emr, S.D., Stt4 PI 4-kinase localizes to the plasma membrane and functions in the Pkc1-mediated MAP kinase cascade (2002) Dev Cell, 2, pp. 593-605; Audhya, A., Foti, M., Emr, S.D., Distinct roles for the yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, stt4p and pik1p, in secretion, cell growth, and organelle membrane dynamics (2000) Mol Biol Cell, 11, pp. 2673-2689; Balla, A., Tuymetova, G., Barshishat, M., Geiszt, M., Balla, T., Characterization of type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase isoforms reveals association of the enzymes with endosomal vesicular compartments (2002) J Biol Chem, 277, pp. 20041-20050; Balla, T., Downing, G.J., Jaffe, H., Kim, S., Zolyomi, A., Catt, K.J., Isolation and molecular cloning of wortmannin-sensitive bovine type III phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (1997) J Biol Chem, 272, pp. 18358-18366; Berridge, M.J., Irvine, R.F., Inositol phosphates and cell signaling (1989) Nature, 341, pp. 197-205; Bunney, T.D., Watkins, P.A., Beven, A.F., Shaw, P.J., Hernandez, L.E., Lomonossoff, G.P., Shanks, M., Drobak, B.K., Association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with nuclear transcription sites in higher plants (2000) Plant Cell, 12, pp. 1679-1688; Carman, G.M., Deems, R.A., Dennis, E.A., Lipid signaling enzymes and surface dilution kinetics (1995) J Biol Chem, 270, pp. 18711-18714; Carpenter, C.L., Cantley, L.C., Phosphoinositide kinases (1990) Biochemistry, 29, pp. 11147-11156; Carraway, K.L., Carraway, C.A.C., (1992) The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach, , Oxford University Press, New York; Cho, M.H., Shears, S.B., Boss, W.F., Changes in phosphatidylinositol metabolism in response to hyperosmotic stress in Daucus carota L. cells grown in suspension culture (1993) Plant Physiol, 103, pp. 637-647; Cockcroft, S., Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins: Requirements in phospholipase C signaling and in regulated exocytosis (1997) FEBS Lett, 410, pp. 44-48; Cockcroft, S., Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins: A requirement in signal transduction and vesicle traffic (1998) BioEssays, 20, pp. 423-432; Cutler, N.S., Heitman, J., Cardenas, M.E., STT4 is an essential phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase that is a target of wortmannin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1997) J Biol Chem, 272, pp. 27671-27677; Davis, S.J., Vierstra, R.D., Soluble, highly fluorescent variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) for use in higher plants (1998) Plant Mol Biol, 36, pp. 521-528; De Matteis, M.A., Godi, A., Corda, D., Phosphoinositides and the Golgi complex (2002) Curr Opin Cell Biol, 14, pp. 434-447; Drøbak, B.K., Dewey, R.E., Boss, W.F., Phosphoinositide kinases and the synthesis of polyphosphoinositides in higher plant cells (1999) International Review of Cytology, pp. 95-130. , KW Jeon, ed.

The transgenic cell lines showed a 12- to 25-fold increase in InsP 5-ptase activity in vitro and a 60% to 80% reduction in basal InsP3 compared with wild-type cells. Stimulation with Mas-7, a synthetic analog of the wasp venom peptide mastoparan, resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in InsP3 in both wild-type and transgenic cells. However, even with stimulation, InsP3 levels in the transgenic cells did not reach wild-type basal values, suggesting that InsP3 signaling is compromised. Analysis of whole-cell lipids indicated that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2), the lipid precursor of InsP3, was greatly reduced in the transgenic cells. In vitro assays of enzymes involved in PtdInsP2 metabolism showed that the activity of the PtdInsP2-hydrolyzing enzyme phospholipase C was not significantly altered in the transgenic cells. In contrast, the activity of the plasma membrane PtdInsP 5 kinase was increased by approximately 3-fold in the transgenic cells. In vivo labeling studies revealed a greater incorporation of 32P into PtdInsP2 in the transgenic cells compared with the wild type, indicating that the rate of PtdInsP2 synthesis was increased.

Concomitant with the decrease in PtdInsP2 levels in plasma membranes, there was an increase in PtdInsP2 in microsomes, suggesting that the levels of plasma membrane PtdInsP2 are regulated differentially. The decline of PtdInsP2 in plasma membranes was accompanied by a 70% decrease in the specific activity of PtdInsP kinase and by reduced levels of protein cross-reacting with antisera against a conserved PtdInsP kinase domain. Upon osmotic stimulation, the loss of PtdInsP2from the plasma membrane increased from 10% in 7-d-old cells to 60% in 12-d-old cells, although the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) produced in whole cells were roughly equal at both times. When cells with low plasma membrane PtdInsP2 levels were osmotically stimulated, a mild osmotic stress (12.5 mM KCl) activated PtdInsP kinase prior to InsP3 production, whereas in cells with high plasma membrane PtdInsP2, more severe stress (250 mM KCl) was required to induce an increase in PtdInsP kinase activity. The differential regulation of a plasma membrane signaling pool of PtdInsP2 is discussed with regard to the implications for understanding the responsive state of cells.",,"algal cell culture; cell growth; cell membrane; cell stimulation; concentration (parameters); day length; enzyme activity; genetic regulation; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; microsome; osmotic stress; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; plant cell; potassium chloride; protein domain; reduction; Algae; Biological membranes; Cell culture; Cells; Proteins; Osmotic simulation; Plants (botany); Non-programmatic; Algae, Red; Blotting, Western; Cell Membrane; Cells, Cultured; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Microsomes; Osmotic Pressure; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Phospholipids; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Signal Transduction; Time",,"Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, 85166-31-0; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; phosphatidylinositol phosphate 4-kinase, EC 2.7.1.-; Phospholipids; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), EC 2.7.1.-",,,,"Anderson, R.A., Boronenkov, I.V., Doughman, S.D., Kunz, J., Loijens, J.C., Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases, a multifaceted family of signaling enzymes (1999) J Biol Chem, 274, pp. 9907-9910; Askerlund, P., Modulation of an intracellular calmodulin-stimulated Ca2+-pumping ATPase in cauliflower by trypsin: The use of Calcium Green-5N to measure Ca2+ transport in membrane vesicles (1996) Plant Physiol, 110, pp. 913-922; Auethavekiat, V., Abrams, C.S., Majerus, P.W., Phosphorylation of platelet pleckstrin activates inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase I (1997) J Biol Chem, 272, pp. 1786-1790; Balla, T., Bondeva, T., Varnai, P., How accurately can we image inositol lipids in living cells?

NT1 cells and Arabidopsis plants were transformed with a maize (Zea mays) CRT gene in both sense and antisense orientations under the control of an Arabidopsis heat shock promoter. ER-enriched membrane fractions from NT1 cells were used to examine how altered expression of CRT affects Ca2+ uptake and release. We found that a 2.5-fold increase in CRT led to a 2-fold increase in ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ accumulation in the ER-enriched fraction compared with heat-shocked wild-type controls. Furthermore, after treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, ER microsomes from NT1 cells overproducing CRT showed a 2-fold increase in the amount of 45Ca2+ released, and a 2-to 3-fold increase in the amount of 45Ca2+ retained compared with wild type. These data indicate that altering the production of CRT affects the ER Ca2+ pool. In addition, CRT transgenic Arabidopsis plants were used to determine if altered CRT levels had any physiological effects. We found that the level of CRT in heat shock-induced CRT transgenic plants correlated positively with the retention of chlorophyll when the plants were transferred from Ca2+-containing medium to Ca2+-depleted medium. Together these data are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing CRT in the ER increases the ER Ca2+ stores and thereby enhances the survival of plants grown in low Ca2+ medium.",,"calcium binding protein; calcium ion; calreticulin; culture medium; endoplasmic reticulum; genetic transformation; heat shock; microsome; plant; protein expression; protein folding; protein induction; survival; suspension cell culture; transgenic plant; wild relative; Cell membranes; Cells; Chlorophyll; Genes; Physiology; Proteins; Tobacco; Heat shock promoters; Plants (botany); NASA Discipline Plant Biology; Non-NASA Center; Arabidopsis; Calcium; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Calreticulin; Cell Line; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Heat-Shock Response; Phenotype; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Plants, Toxic; Ribonucleoproteins; Tobacco; Zea mays",,"Calcium, 7440-70-2; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Calreticulin; Plant Proteins; Ribonucleoproteins",,,,"Ahmed, S.U., Bar-Peled, M., Raikhel, N.V., Cloning and subcellular location of an Arabidopsis receptor-like protein that shares common features with protein-sorting receptors of eukaryotic cells (1997) Plant Physiol, 114, pp. 325-336; Allen, G.J., Chu, S.P., Schumacher, K., Shimazaki, C.T., Vafeados, D., Kemper, A., Hawke, S.D., Harper, J.F., Alteration of stimulus-specific guard cell calcium oscillations and stomatal closing in Arabidopsis det3 mutant (2000) Science, 289, pp. 2338-2342; Allen, G.J., Kwak, J.M., Chu, S.P., Llopis, J., Tsien, R.Y., Harper, J.F., Schroeder, J.I., Cameleon calcium indicator reports cytoplasmic calcium dynamics in Arabidopsis guard cells (1999) Plant J, 19, pp. 735-747; Allen, G.S., Hall, G.E., Childs, L.C., Weissinger, A.K., Thompson, W.F., Scaffold attachment regions increase reporter gene expression in stably transformed plant cells (1993) Plant Cell, 5, pp. 603-613; An, G., High efficiency transformation of cultured tobacco cells (1985) Plant Physiol, 79, pp. 568-570; Bastianutto, C., Clementi, E., Codazzi, F., Podini, P., De Giorgi, F., Rizzuto, R., Meldolesi, J., Pozzan, T., Overexpression of calreticulin increases the Ca2+ capacity of rapidly exchanging Ca2+ stores and reveals aspects of their lumenal microenvironment and function (1995) J Cell Biol, 130, pp. 847-855; Bechtold, N., Pelletier, G., In planta Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of adult Arabidopsis thaliana plants by vacuum infiltration (1998) Methods Mol Biol, 82, pp. 259-266; Bers, D.M., Patton, C.W., Nuccitelli, R., A practical guide to the preparation of Ca2+ buffers (1994) Methods Cell Biol, 40, pp. 3-29; Burns, K., Duggan, B., Atkinson, E.A., Famulski, K.S., Nemer, M., Bleackley, R.C., Michalak, M., Modulation of gene expression by calreticulin binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 476-480; Bush, D., Calcium regulation in plant cells and its role in signaling (1993) Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol, 46, pp. 95-122; Bush, D., Regulation of cytosolic calcium in plants (1995) Plant Physiol, 103, pp. 7-13; Camacho, P., Lechleiter, J.D., Calreticulin inhibits repetitive intracellular Ca2+ waves (1995) Cell, 82, pp. 765-771; Cantley L.C., Jr., Josephson, L., Warner, R., Yanagisawa, M., Lechene, C., Guidotti, G., Vanadate is a potent (Na, K)-ATPase inhibitor found in ATP derived from muscle (1977) J Biol Chem, 252, pp. 7421-7423; Cessna, S.G., Low, P.S., An apoplastic Ca2+ sensor regulates internal Ca2+ release in aequorin-transformed tobacco cells (2001) J Biol Chem, 276, pp. 10655-10662; Chen, F., Hayes, P.M., Mulrooney, D.M., Pan, A., Identification and characterization of cDNA clones encoding plant calreticulin in barley (1994) Plant Cell, 6, pp. 835-843; Conway, E.M., Liu, L., Nowakowski, B., Steiner-Mosonyi, M., Ribeiro, S.P., Michalak, M., Heat shock-sensitive expression of calreticulin (1995) J Biol Chem, 270, pp. 17011-17016; Coppolino, M.G., Woodside, M.J., Demaurex, N., Grinstein, S., St-Arnaud, R., Dedhar, S., Calreticulin is essential for integrin-mediated calcium signalling and cell adhesion (1997) Nature, 386, pp. 843-847; Corbett, E.F., Michalak, M., Calcium, a signaling molecule in the endoplasmic reticulum?

We used the maize (Zea mays) floury-2 (fl2) mutant and soybean (Glycine max) suspension cultures treated with tunicamycin (Tm) to investigate the ER stress response as it relates to phospholipid metabolism in plants. Four key phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, including DG kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-phosphate 5-kinase were up-regulated in the fl2 mutant, specifically in protein body fractions where the mutation has its greatest effect. The third up-regulated enzyme, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, was regulated by fl2 gene dosage and developmental signals. Elevated accumulation of the fourth enzyme, PI 4-kinase, was observed in the fl2 endosperm and soybean cells treated with Tm. The activation of these phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes was accompanied by alterations in membrane lipid synthesis and accumulation. The fl2 mutant exhibited increased PI content in protein body membranes at 18 d after pollination and more than 3-fold higher triacylglycerol accumulation in the endosperm by 36 d after pollination. Incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into phospholipids in soybean culture cells increased by about 30% with Tm treatment. The coordinated regulation of ER stress related proteins and multiple components of phospholipid biosynthesis is consistent with signaling through a common pathway. We postulate that the plant ER stress response has an important role in general plant metabolism, and more specifically in integrating the synthesis of protein and lipid reserves to allow proper seed formation.",,"biochemical pathway; choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase; endoplasmic reticulum; endosperm; enzyme activation; enzyme induction; enzyme regulation; gene mutation; lipid metabolism; mutant; phosphatidylinositol; phospholipid; plant response; signal transduction; stress; suspension cell culture; tunimycin; Biological membranes; Biosynthesis; Cell culture; Mutagens; Phospholipids; Seed; Pollination; Enzymes; Non-programmatic; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase; Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase; Diacylglycerol Kinase; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Lipid Metabolism; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Seeds; Soybeans; Tunicamycin; Glycine max; Zea mays",,"1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase, EC 2.7.1.67; 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, EC 2.7.1.68; Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.15; Diacylglycerol Kinase, EC 2.7.1.107; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), EC 2.7.1.-; Tunicamycin, 11089-65-9",,,,"Abusteit, E.O., Corbin, F.T., Schmitt, D.P., Burton, J.W., Worsham, A.D., Thompson L., Jr., Absorption, translocation and metabolism of metribuzin in diploid and tetraploid soybean (Glycine max) plants and cell cultures (1985) Weed Sci, 33, pp. 618-628; Bertolotti, A., Zhang, Y., Hendershot, L.M., Harding, H.P., Ron, D., Dynamic interaction of BiP and ER stress transducers in the unfolded-protein response (2000) Nat Cell Biol, 2, pp. 326-332; Boston, R.S., Fontes, E.B.P., Shank, B.B., Wrobel, R.L., Increased expression of the maize immunoglobulin binding protein homolog b-70 in three zein regulatory mutants (1991) Plant Cell, 3, pp. 497-505; Boston, R.S., Viitanen, P.V., Vierling, E., Molecular chaperones and protein folding in plants (1996) Plant Mol Biol, 32, pp. 191-222; Browse, J., McCourt, P.J., Somerville, C.R., Fatty acid composition of leaf lipids determined after combined digestion and fatty acid methyl ester formation from fresh tissue (1986) Anal Biochem, 152, pp. 141-145; Chapman, R., Sidrauski, C., Walter, P., Intracellular signaling from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus (1998) Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol, 14, pp. 459-485; Cho, M.H., Tan, Z., Erneux, C., Shears, S.B., Boss, W.F., The effects of mastoparan on the carrot cell plasma membrane polyphosphoinositide phospholipase C (1995) Plant Physiol, 107, pp. 845-856; Coleman, C.E., Lopes, M.A., Gillikin, J.W., Boston, R.S., Larkins, B.A., A defective signal peptide in the maize high-lysine mutant floury-2 (1995) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 92, pp. 6828-6831; Coughlan, S.J., Hastings, C., Winfrey R.J., Jr., Molecular characterization of plant endoplasmic reticulum: Identification of protein disulfide-isomerase as the major reticuloplasmin (1996) Eur J Biochem, 235, pp. 215-224; Coughlan, S.J., Hastings, C., Winfrey R., Jr., Cloning and characterization of the calreticulin gene from Ricinus communis L.

To date, the signaling processes by which the perception of a gravistimulus is linked to the initiation of differential growth are poorly defined. We have investigated the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in the gravitropic response of oat (Avena sativa) shoot pulvini. Within 15 s of gravistimulation, InsP3 levels increased 3-fold over vertical controls in upper and lower pulvinus halves and fluctuated in both pulvinus halves over the first minutes. Between 10 and 30 min of gravistimulation, InsP3 levels in the lower pulvinus half increased 3-fold over the upper. Changes in InsP3 were confined to the pulvinus and were not detected in internodal tissue, highlighting the importance of the pulvinus for both graviperception and response. Inhibition of phospholipase C blocked the long-term increase in InsP3, and reduced gravitropic bending by 65%. Short-term changes in InsP3 were unimpaired by the inhibitor. Gravitropic bending of oat plants is inhibited at 4°C; however, the plants retain the information of a positional change and respond at room temperature. Both short- and long-term changes in InsP3 were present at 4°C. We propose a role for InsP3 in the establishment of tissue polarity during the gravitropic response of oat pulvini. InsP3 may be involved in the retention of cold-perceived gravistimulation by providing positional information in the pulvini prior to the redistribution of auxin.",,"auxin; Avena sativa; cell stimulation; enzyme inhibition; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; phospholipase C; plant growth; plant response; plant tissue; room temperature; shoot growth; signal transduction; NASA Discipline Plant Biology; Non-NASA Center; Avena sativa; Cold; Enzyme Inhibitors; Estrenes; Gravitropism; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Phospholipase C; Plant Shoots; Pyrrolidinones; Signal Transduction; Avena sativa",,"1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione, 112648-68-7; Enzyme Inhibitors; Estrenes; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, 85166-31-0; Phospholipase C, EC 3.1.4.3; Pyrrolidinones",,,,"Ault, K.T., Durmowicz, G., Galione, A., Harger, P.L., Busa, W.B., Modulation of Xenopus embryo mesoderm-specific gene expression and dorsoanterior patterning by receptors that activate the phosphatidylinositol cycle signal transduction pathway (1996) Development, 122, pp. 2033-2041; Behrens, H.M., Gradmann, D., Sievers, A., Membrane-potential responses following gravistimulation in roots of Lepidium sativum L.

[14C]Ethanolamine was incorporated into the PGE modification, and with carrot (Daucus carota L.) suspension culture cells, eEF1A was the only protein that incorporated detectable quantities of [14C]ethanolamine (Ransom et al., 1998). When 1 mM CaCl2 was added to microsomes containing [14C]ethanolamine-labeled eEF1A ([14C]et-eEF1A), there was a 60% decrease in the amount of [14C]et-eEF1A recovered after 10 min. The loss of endogenous [14C]et-eEF1A was prevented by adding EGTA. Recombinant eFF1A, which did not contain the PGE modification, also was degraded by microsomes in a Ca2+-regulated manner, indicating that PGE modification was not necessary for proteolysis; however, it enabled us to quantify enodgenous eFF1A. By monitoring [14C]et-eEF1A, we found that treatment with phospholipase D or C, but not phospholipase A2, resulted in a decrease in [14C]et-eEF1A from carrot microsomes. The fact that there was no loss of [14C]et-eEF1A with phospholipase A2 treatment even in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ suggested that the loss of membrane lipids was not essential for eEF1A proteolysis and that lysolipids or fatty acids decreased proteolysis. At micromolar Ca2+ concentrations, proteolysis of eEF1A was pH sensitive. When 1 μM CaCl2 was added at pH 7.2, 35% of [14C]et-eEF1A was lost; while at pH 6.8, 10 μM CaCl2 was required to give a similar loss of protein. These data suggest that eEF1A may be an important downstream target for Ca2+ and lipid-mediated signal transduction cascades.",,"calcium chloride; calcium; egtazic acid; eukaryotic elongation factor alpha;

Of these, the phosphoinositide pathway is one of the best conserved. The ability of the phosphoinositides to permeate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments, and their diverse functions within cells have contributed to their persistence in nature. In eukaryotes, phosphoinositides are essential metabolites as well as labile messengers that regulate cellular physiology while traveling within and between cells. The stereospecificity of the six hydroxyls on the inositol ring provides the basis for the functional diversity of the phosphorylated isomers that, in turn, generate a selective means of intracellular and intercellular communication for coordinating cell growth.

As the site of both graviperception and response, the pulvinus is an ideal system to study how organisms sense changes in orientation. We observed a transient 5-fold increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) within 10 s of gravistimulation in the lower half of the pulvinus, indicating that the positional change was sensed immediately. Over the first 30 min, rapid IP3 fluctuations were observed between the upper and lower halves. Maize plants require a presentation time of between 2 and 4 h before the cells on the lower side of the pulvinus are committed to elongation. After 2 h of gravistimulation, the lower half consistently had higher IP3, and IP3 levels on the lower side continued to increase up to ≃5-fold over basal levels before visible growth. As bending became visible after 8-10 h, IP3 levels returned to basal values. Additionally, phosphatidylinositol 4- phosphate 5-kinase activity in the lower pulvinus half increased transiently within 10 min of gravistimulation, suggesting that the increased IP3 production was accompanied by an up-regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate biosynthesis. Neither IP3 levels nor phosphatidylinositol 4- phosphate 5-kinase activity changed in pulvini halves from vertical control plants. Our data indicate the involvement of IP3 and inositol phospholipids in both short- and long-term responses to gravistimulation. As a diffusible second messenger, IP3 provides a mechanism to transmit and amplify the signal from the perceiving to the responding cells in the pulvinus, coordinating a synchronized growth response.",,"inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; article; cell growth; gravity; growth regulation; maize; nonhuman; plant growth; priority journal; second messenger; NASA Discipline Plant Biology; Non-NASA Center; Cell Membrane; Cell Size; Gravitation; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Pulvinus; Second Messenger Systems; Time Factors; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, EC 2.7.1.68; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, 85166-31-0; inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase, EC 3.1.3.56; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, EC 3.1.3.-; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), EC 2.7.1.-",,,,"Sack, F.D., (1991) Int.

Although in most cells these lipids, with the exception of phosphatidylinositol, constitute only a very minor proportion of total cellular lipids, they have received immense attention by researchers in the past 15-20 years. This is due to the discovery that these lipids, rather than just having structural functions, play key roles in a wide range of important cellular processes. Much less is known about the plant phosphoinositides than about their mammalian counterparts. However, it has been established that a functional phosphoinositide system exists in plant cells and it is becoming increasingly clear that inositol-containing lipids are likely to play many important roles throughout the life of a plant. It is not our intention to give an exhaustive overview of all aspects of the field, but rather we focus on the phosphoinositide kinases responsible for the synthesis of all phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol. Also, we mention some of the aspects of current phosphoinositide research which, in our opinion, are most likely to provide a suitable starting point for further research into the role of phosphoinositides in plants.","Biosynthesis; Cell signaling; Inositol; Kinases; Phosphatidylinositol; Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins; Phospholipids; Plants","carrier protein; inositol; lipid; phosphatidylinositide; phosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylinositol kinase; phospholipid; biosynthesis; higher plant; nonhuman; phosphoinositide metabolism; priority journal; review; signal transduction; NASA Discipline Plant Biology; Non-NASA Center; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Animals; Eukaryotic Cells; Humans; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphotransferases; Plants",,"1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, EC 2.7.1.137; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphotransferases, EC 2.7.-",,,,"Balla, T., Downing, G.J., Jaffe, H., Kim, S., Zolyomi, A., Galt, K.J., Isolation and molecular cloning of wortmannin-sensitive bovine type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (1997) J.

Seven days after inoculation, the amount of PIP2 in the cells was 910 ± 100 pmol g-1 fresh weight; by 12 d, PIP2 levels increased to 1200 ± 150 pmol g-1 fresh weight. In vitro assays indicated that phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) kinase specific activity increased from 75 to 230 pmol rain-1 mg-1 protein between d 7 and 12. When G. sulphuraria cells were osmostimulated, transient increases of up to 4-fold could be observed in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) levels within 90 s, regardless of the age of the cells. In d-12 cells, the increase in IP3 was preceded by a transient increase of up to 5-fold in specific PIP kinase activity, whereas no such increase was detected after osmostimulation of d-7 cells. The increase in PIP kinase activity before IP3 signaling in d-12 cells indicates that there is an additional pathway for regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism after stimulation other than an initial activation of phospholipase C. Also, the rapid activation of PIP2 biosynthesis in cells with already-high PIP2 levels suggests that the PIP2 present was not available for signal transduction. By comparing the response of the cells at d 7 and 12, we have identified two potentially distinct pools of PIP2.",,"culture optimization; inoculation; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; metabolic regulation; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; phosphoinositide metabolism; phospholipase c; plant development; signal transduction; Galdieria sulphuraria",,,,,,"Auethavekiat, V., Abrams, C.S., Majerus, P.W., Phosphorylation of platelet pleckstrin activates inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase I (1997) J Biol Chem, 272, pp. 1786-1790; Borochov, A., Cho, M.H., Boss, W.F., Plasma membrane lipid metabolism of petunia petals during senescence (1994) Physiol Plant, 90, pp. 279-284; Cho, M.H., Boss, W.F., Transmembrane signaling and phosphoinositides (1995) Methods in Plant Cell Biology: Part A, pp. 543-554. , DW Galbraith, HJ Bohnert, DP Bourque, eds, Academic Press, New York; Cho, M.H., Chen, Q., Okpodu, C.M., Boss, W.F., Separating and detecting inositol phospholipids (1992) LC-GC, 10, pp. 464-468; Cho, M.H., Shears, S.B., Boss, W.F., Changes in phosphatidylinositol metabolism in response to hyperosmotic stress in Daucus carota L.

There are three known posttranslational modifications of eEF-1A that could potentially affect its function. Except for phosphorylation, the other posttranslational modifications have not been demonstrated in plants. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry and peptide mass mapping, we show that carrot (Daucus carota L.) eEF-1A contains a phosphoglycerylethanolamine (PGE) posttranslational modification. cEF-1A was the only protein labeled with [14C]ethanolaminc in carrot cells and was the predominant ethanolamine-labeled protein in Arabidopsis seedlings and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cell cultures. In vivo-labeling studies using [3H]glycerol, [32P]Pi, [14C]myristic acid, and [14C]linoleic acid indicated that the entire phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine is covalently attached to the protein. The PGE lipid modification did not affect the partitioning of eEF-1 A in Triton X-114 or its actin-binding activity in in vitro assays. Our in vitro data indicate that this newly characterized posttranslational modification alone does not affect the function of eEF-1 A. Therefore, the PGE lipid modification may work in combination with other posttranslational modifications to affect the distribution and the function of eEF-1A within the cell.",,"carbon; diagnostic agent; elongation factor; elongation factor 1; ethanolamine; glycerophosphoethanolamine; macrogol derivative; Nonidet P-40; phosphatidylethanolamine; triton x 114; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; article; binding site; carrot; chemistry; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; protein processing; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Carbon Radioisotopes; Conserved Sequence; Daucus carota; Ethanolamine; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptide Elongation Factor 1; Peptide Elongation Factors; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Plant Proteins; Polyethylene Glycols; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",,"Carbon Radioisotopes; Ethanolamine, 141-43-5; glycerophosphoethanolamine, 1190-00-7; Nonidet P-40, 9036-19-5; Peptide Elongation Factor 1; Peptide Elongation Factors; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Plant Proteins; Polyethylene Glycols",,,,"Abe, S., Ito, Y., Davies, E., Co-sedimentation of actin, tubulin and membranes in the cytoskeleton fractions, from peas and mouse 3T3 cells (1992) J Exp Botany, 43, pp. 941-949; Aguilar, F., Montandon, P.-E., Stutz, E., Two genes encoding the soybean translation elongation factor eEF-la are transcribed in seedling leaves (1991) Plant Mol Biol, 17, pp. 351-360; Clore, A.M., Dannenhoffer, J.M., Larkins, B.A., EF-la is associated with a cytoskeletal network surrounding protein bodies in maize endosperm cells (1996) Plant Cell, 8, pp. 2003-2014; Collings, D.A., Wasteneys, G.O., Miyazaki, M., Williamson, R.E., Elongation factor la is a component of the subcortical actin bundles of Characean algae (1994) Cell Biol Int, 18, pp. 1019-1024; Demma, M., Warren, V., Hock, R., Dharmawardhane, S., Condeelis, J., Isolation of an abundant 50,000-dalton actin filament bundling protein from Dictyostelium amoebae (1990) J Biol Chem, 265, pp. 2286-2291; Dever, T.E., Costello, C.E., Owens, C.L., Rosenberry, T.L., Merrick, W.C., Location of seven post-translational modifications in rabbit elongation factor la including dimethyllysine, trimethyllysine, and glycerylphosphorylethanolamine (1989) J Biol Chem, 264, pp. 20518-20525; Lenstra, J.A., Van Vliet, A., Arnberg, A.C., Van Hemert, F.J., Moller, W., Genes coding for the elongation factor EF-lα in Artemia (1986) Eur J Biochem, 155, pp. 475-483; Liu, G., Tang, J., Edmonds, B.T., Murray, J., Levin, S., Condeelis, J., F-actin sequesters elongation factor la from interaction with aminoacyl-tRNA in a pH-dependent reaction (1996) J Cell Biol, 135, pp. 953-963; Merrick, W.C., Hershey, J.W.B., The pathway and mechanism of eukaryotic protein synthesis (1996) Translational Control, pp. 31-69. , JWB Hershey, MB Mathews, N Sonenberg eds, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; Metz, A.M., Timmer, R.T., Allen, M.L., Browning, K.S., Sequence of a cDNA encoding the a-subunit of wheat translation elongation factor 1 (1992) Gene, 120, pp. 315-316; Stone, K.L., Williams, K.R., Enzymatic digestion of proteins and HPLC peptide isolation (1993) A Practical to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing, Ed 2, pp. 43-69. , P Matsudaira, ed, Academic Press, San Diego, CA; Yang, W., Boss, W.F., Regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase by the protein activator PIK-A49: Activation requires phosphorylation of PIK-A49 (1994) J Biol Chem, 269, pp. 3852-3857","Ransom, W.D.; Botany Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7612, United States; email: wendy_boss@ncsu.edu",,,,,,,,00320889,,PLPHA,9662537,"English","Plant Physiol.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032114345

O. Box 7612, Raleigh, NC 27695, United States","Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are found in many proteins involved in signal transduction, including the family of large molecular mass phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinases. Although the exact function of these newly discovered domains is unknown, it is recognized that they may influence enzyme regulation by binding different ligands. In this study, the recombinant PI 4-kinase PH domain was explored for its ability to bind to different phospholipids. First, we isolated partial cDNAs of the &gt;7-kilobase transcripts of PI 4-kinases from carrot (DcPI4Kα) and Arabidopsis (AtPI4Kα). The deduced primary sequences were 41% identical and 68% similar to rat and human PI 4-kinases and contained the telltale lipid kinase unique domain, PH domain, and catalytic domain. Antibodies raised against the expressed lipid kinase unique, PH, and catalytic domains identified a polypeptide of 205-kDa in Arabidopsis microsomes and an F-actin-enriched fraction from carrot cells. The 205-kDa immunoaffinity, purified Arabidopsis protein had PI 4-kinase activity. We have used the expressed PH domain to characterize lipid binding properties. The recombinant PH domain selectively bound to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI-4-P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2), and phosphatidic acid and did not bind to the 3-phosphoinositides. The PH domain had the highest affinity for PI-4-P, the product of the reaction. Consideration is given to the potential impact that this has on cytoskeletal organization and the PI signaling pathway in cells that have a high PI-4-P/PI-4,5-P2 ratio.",,"phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate; phosphatidylinositol kinase; pleckstrin; amino acid sequence; arabidopsis; article; enzyme binding; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; sequence analysis; sequence homology; signal transduction; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Blood Proteins; Blotting, Western; Cells, Cultured; Cloning, Molecular; Daucus carota; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Phosphoproteins; Protein Binding; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Arabidopsis; Daucus carota","GENBANK: AF035936, AF043110","1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase, EC 2.7.1.67; Blood Proteins; phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Phosphoproteins; platelet protein P47; Recombinant Proteins",,,,"Morse, M.J., Crain, R.C., Satter, R.L., (1987) Proc.

Calcium green dextran 10,000 was used to study cellular free Ca2+, and carboxyfluorescein was used to monitor plasmodesmatal closure. When Mas-7 was microinjected into the cytoplasm of cell 1 (the tip cell of a chain of cells), a rapid increase in calcium green dextran10,000 fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasmic areas on both sides of the plasmodesmata connecting cells 1 and 2 during the same time that the diffusion of carboxyfluorescein through them was blocked. The inhibition of cell-to-cell diffusion was transient, and the closed plasmodesmata reopened within 30 s. The elevated Ca2+ level near plasmodesmata was also transient and returned to base level in about 1.5 min. The transient increase in Ca2+, once initiated in cell 1, repeated with an oscillatory period of 3 min. Elevated Ca2+ and oscillations of Ca2+ were also observed near interconnecting cell walls throughout the chain of cells, indicating that the signal had been transmitted. Previously, we reported that IP3 closed plasmodesmata; now we report that it stimulated Ca2+ and oscillations similar to Mas-7. The effect was specific for similar concentrations of Mas-7 over Mas-17 and active IP3 over inactive IP3. It is important that the Ca2+ channel blocker La1+ eliminated the responses from Mas-7 and IP3, indicating that an influx of Ca2+ was required. These results support the contention that plasmodesmata functioning is regulated via Ca2+ and that IP3 may be an intermediary between the stimulus and Ca2+ elevations.",,,,,,,,"Alexandre, J., Lassalles, J.P., Kado, R.T., Opening of Ca2+ channels in isolated red beet root vacuole membrane by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1990) Nature, 343, pp. 567-570;

The identity of [3H]inositol-1,4,5-P3 was confirmed by phosphorylation with inositol-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase and co-migration with inositol-1,3,4,5-P4. The changes in phosphoinositides were evident within 1 min. The loss of [3H]PIP was evident only when cells were treated with the higher concentrations (10 and 25 μM) of mastoparan or Mas-7. At 1 μM Mas-7, [3H]PIP increased. The inactive mastoparan analog Mas-17 had little or no effect on [3H]PIP or [3H]PIP2 hydrolysis in vivo. Neomycin (100 μM) inhibited the uptake of Mas-7 and thereby inhibited the Mas-7-stimulated hydrolysis of [3H]PIP and [3H]PIP2. Plasma membranes isolated from mastoparan-treated cells had increased PIP-phospholipase C (PLC) activity. However, when Mas-7 was added to isolated plasma membranes from control cells, it had no effect on PIP-PLC activity at low concentrations and inhibited PIP-PLC at concentrations greater than 10 μM. In addition, guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) had no effect on the PIP-PLC activity when added to plasma membranes isolated from either the Mas-7-treated or control cells. The fact that Mas-7 did not stimulate PIP-PLC activity in vitro indicated that the Mas-7-induced increase in PIP-PLC in vivo required a factor that was lost from the membrane during isolation.",,"1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase; calcium channel blocking agent; guanosine 5' o (3 thiotriphosphate); inositol phosphate; lanthanum; mastoparan; neomycin; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate phosphodiesterase; phosphodiesterase; wasp venom; amino acid sequence; article; carrot; cell culture; cell membrane; cytology; drug effect; enzyme activation; enzymology; metabolism; molecular genetics; Amino Acid Sequence; Calcium Channel Blockers; Cell Membrane; Cells, Cultured; Daucus carota; Enzyme Activation; Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate); Inositol Phosphates; Lanthanum; Molecular Sequence Data; Neomycin; Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Wasp Venoms; Daucus carota",,"guanosine 5' o (3 thiotriphosphate), 37589-80-3; inositol phosphate, 15421-51-9; lanthanum, 16096-89-2, 7439-91-0; mastoparan, 72093-21-1; neomycin, 11004-65-2, 1404-04-2, 1405-10-3, 8026-22-0; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate phosphodiesterase, 37213-51-7, 63551-76-8; 1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase, EC 3.1.4.11; Calcium Channel Blockers; Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate), 37589-80-3; Inositol Phosphates; Lanthanum, 7439-91-0; mastoparan, 72093-21-1; Neomycin, 1404-04-2; Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases, EC 3.1.4; Wasp Venoms",,,,,"Boss, W.F.; Department of Botany, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7612, United States; email: wendy_boss@ncsu.edu",,,,,,,,00320889,,PLPHA,7716245,"English","Plant Physiol.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029257194

The M, of the enzyme was estimated to be 83,000 by gel filtration. PI 4-kinase activity was recovered after renaturation of the 80-kD region of polyacrylamide gels, and an 80-kD peptide cross-reacted with antibodies to the yeast 55-kD membrane-associated PI 4-kinase on western blots. The isolated lipid kinase phosphorylated PI but not lysophosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylinositol monophosphate. Maximal PI kinase activity occurred when the substrate was added as Triton X-100/PI mixed micelles at pH 8. The enzyme required divalent cations. At low concentrations (1-5 mM), Mn2+ was more effective than Mg2+ in increasing enzyme activity; however, maximal activity occurred at 25 to 40 mM Mg2+. Calcium from 0.01 μM to 1 mM had no effect on the enzyme activity. The Km of the enzyme for ATP was estimated to be between 400 and 463 μM. The enzyme was inhibited by adenosine (100 μM); however, ADP (up to 100 μM) had no effect on the activity.

To determine whether the enzyme would respond differently to the compounds in a membrane-associated versus a soluble state, both the plasma membrane and solubilized (released by 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100) PI 4-kinase were used. Spermidine, spermine, polylysine, cardiotoxin, melittin, and histone stimicrolated the solubilized PI 4-kinase but had little effect on or weakly stimicrolated the membrane-associated PI 4-kinase. Polyarginine inhibited membrane-associated PI 4-kinase 75% and inhibited the solubilized PI 4-kinase 30%, indicating that charge alone was not sufficient for activation. Polyarginine also eliminated the activation of the solubilized PI 4-kinase by a PI 4-kinase activator protein, PIK-A49. Calmodulin, a common calcium-binding protein, at micromolar levels strongly inhibited solubilized PI 4-kinase activity but did not inhibit membrane-associated PI 4-kinase activity. The inhibition of,the solubilized PI 4-kinase by calmodulin was calcium independent. Calcium alone (1 μM-0.1 mM) inhibited PI 4-kinase activity only slightly (<30%). The differential effects of the positively charged compounds on the solubilized and membrane-associated PI 4-kinase were not due to substrate availability because both enzymes were assayed in the presence of excess PI (0.6 mM) and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100. The data suggest that positively charged compounds affected the enzyme activity not only by interacting with the substrates or products of the reaction but also by interacting with the PI 4-kinase or regulatory components in the plasma membrane. © 1994 Academic Press.

C., and Boss, W. F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 392-398). PEK-A49 is a multifunctional protein that binds and bundles F-actin and has translational elongation factor-1α activity. In this paper, we have investigated the mechanism of activation of PI 4-kinase by PIK-A49. PEK-A49 decreased the Km of PI 4-kinase for ATP from 0.40 to 0.19 mM. GTP and GDP, which affect the elongation factor-1α function of the protein, inhibited the activation of PI 4-kinase by PIK-A49. Phosphorylation of purified PIK-A49 by a calcium-dependent protein kinase enhanced activation of PI 4-kinase. When dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase, PIK-A49 no longer activated PI 4-kinase; however, rephosphorylation of PIK-A49 by calcium-dependent protein kinase fully restored activation. Western blots using anti-PIK-A49 serum showed that PIK-A49 was associated with the plasma membrane and the F-actin fraction isolated from plasma membranes, indicating that PEK-A49 would be in a position to regulate plasma membrane PI 4-kinase. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism for feed-forward regulation of polyphosphoinositide biosynthesis in response to increases in cytosolic calcium.",,"Daucus carota; calcium; enzyme activator; f actin; phosphatidylinositol kinase; pik a49; unclassified drug; article; calcium cell level; carrot; cell membrane; dephosphorylation; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; enzyme regulation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase; Calcium; Cell Membrane; Cells, Cultured; Egtazic Acid; Enzyme Activation; Guanosine Diphosphate; Guanosine Triphosphate; Kinetics; Molecular Weight; Peptide Elongation Factors; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Kinases; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,"calcium, 7440-70-2; F actin, 39409-31-9; phosphatidylinositol kinase, 37205-54-2; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase, EC 2.7.1.67; Calcium, 7440-70-2; Egtazic Acid, 67-42-5; Guanosine Diphosphate, 146-91-8; Guanosine Triphosphate, 86-01-1; Peptide Elongation Factors; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), EC 2.7.1; PIK-A49 protein, Daucus carota; Plant Proteins; Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37",,,,,"Boss, W.F.; Botany Dept., Box 7612, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, United States",,,,,,,,00219258,,JBCHA,8106430,"English","J.

A time course study indicated that both the inositol phospholipid kinases and the plasma membrane vanadate-sensitive ATPase responded to as little as 5 seconds of treatment with 2% Driselase.

This decrease was not caused by an increase in phospholipase C activity since analysis of the water-soluble products indicated no increase in inositol bisphosphate or inositol trisphosphate. Treatment of the plasma membrane with 200 μM vanadate prior to phosphorylation enhanced the PIP kinase and appeared to overcome the light inhibition. In addition to decreasing the PIP kinase activity, light irradiation resulted in a corresponding decrease in the H+-ATPase activity to 53% of the dark control values.

For more rigorous chemical characterization, carrot inositol phospholipids were then analyzed by negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS). One phosphatidylinositol (PI), two lysophosphatidylinositols (LPI), and one phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) were identified in the carrot samples by the observation of ions [M-H]- and numerous fragment ions in the negative FAB mass spectra. MS/MS analysis were carried out to obtain further structural information of these phospholipids using a double-focusing mass spectrometer in which the magnetic sector (B) and the electrostatic analyzer (E) were scanned at a constant ratio (B/E). These B/E linked scans provided fragment ions of selected precursor ions while eliminating matrix and other contaminating ions. No molecular ions were detected for lysophosphatidylinositol monophosphate (LPIP) or phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), but fragment ions corresponding to these structures were observed. The primary fatty acids present in the carrot inositol phospholipids were linoleic (18:2) and palmitic (16:0) acids, whereas animal lipids contained arachidonic (20:4), stearic (18:0), linoleic, and palmitic acids. The only phosphatidylinositol found in carrot cells was palmitoyl linoleoyl PI. © 1990 American Oil Chemists' Society.",,"phosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylinositol phosphate; phospholipid; unclassified drug; article; higher plant; nonhuman; priority journal; Animalia; Daucus carota; Embryophyta",,,,,,"Berridge, M.J., Irvine, R.F., (1984) Nature, 312, pp. 315-321; Berridge, M.J., (1986) Receptor Biochemistry and Methodology, pp. 25-45. , J.C., Venter, L.C., Harrison, J.W., Putney, Jr., Alan R.

In light of these results, we suggested that IP3 might serve as a second messenger for the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in higher plant cells. To determine whether or not IP3 and other inositol phosphates were present in the carrot cells, the cells were labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol for 18 hours and extracted with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The inositol metabolites were separated by anion exchange chromatography and by paper electrophoresis. We found that [3H]inositol metabolites coeluted with inositol bisphosphate (IP2) and IP3 when separated by anion exchange chromatography. However, we could not detect IP2 or IP3 when the inositol metabolites were analyzed by paper electrophoresis even though the polyphosphoinositides, which are the source of IP2 and IP3, were present in these cells. Thus, [3H] inositol metabolites other than IP2 and IP3 had coeluted on the anion exchange columns. The data indicate that either IP3 is rapidly metabolized or that it is not present at a detectable level in the carrot cells. © 1989 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The lower Rf LPIP comigrates with sn-1-palmitoyl LPIP (16:0 LPIP) synthesized from sn-1-palmitoyl lysophosphatidylinositol. The upper Rf LPIP is presumed to be sn-2-linoleoyl LPIP (18:2 LPIP) based on fatty acid analysis of phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) and comigration with the upper Rf product resulting from the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP. The 18:2 analogue is only a minor component of the LPIP recovered from the fusogenic cells and protoplasts, but it is the predominant form of LPIP in nonfusogenic cells and protoplasts. LPIP is found primarily in the plasma membranes of these cells representing from 10 to 20% of the total [3H]inositol-labeled lipid recovered from isolated plasma membrane. Even though the fusogenic cells lose some of the LPIP as a result of cell wall digestion, if 2% or more of the total protoplast inositol lipid is LPIP, the protoplasts fuse spontaneously with a fusion frequency of greater than 60%. As the fusogenic protoplasts lose their fusion potential, they also lose the relative amount of 16:0 LPIP. Inhibiting the in vivo metabolism of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and PIP in cells and protoplasts with the aminoglycoside, neomycin, does not inhibit fusion. These data indicate that the presence and metabolism of 16:0 LPIP but not the polyphosphoinositides, PIP and PIP2, correlate positively with protoplast fusion. © 1989.","Fusion; Lysophosphatidylinositol monophosphate; Membrane; Phosphatidylinositol; Polyphosphoinositide",,,,,,,"Boss, (1987) Cell Fusion, pp. 145-166. , A.E.

Phosphatidylinositol (PI), lysophos-phatidylinositol (LPI), phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP), lysophosphatidylinositol monophosphate (LPIP), and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) were 55.7%, 12.3%, 5.0%, 11.5%, and 3.6% of the respective [3H]inositol-labeled lipids recovered from the nuclear fraction. While both the plasma membrane and nuclear fraction contained polyphosphoinositides, the distribution of the phosphoinositides and the amount of inositol-labeled lipid were distinct. For example, the nuclear fraction had a higher percentage of LPI and PIP2 and less PI and LPIP than the plasma membrane fraction. The amount of [3H]inositol-labeled lipid recovered from the nuclear fraction per mg protein was an order of magnitude lower than that recovered from either the plasma membrane of lower phase fraction isolated by aqueous two-phase partitioning, or from whole cells and protoplasts. In addition, when the ratio of the [3H]inositol-labeled lipid was compared to total [14C]myristate-labeled lipid recovered there was three to ten fold less [3H] relative to [14C] in the nuclear fraction. These data indicate that while the polyphosphoinositides are a relatively high percentage of the inositol lipid in the nuclear fraction, the inositol lipid was only a small portion of the total lipid in the nuclei. Despite this low concentration of inositol lipid, when [γ32P]-ATP was added to the isolated nuclei,32P-labeled PIP and PIP2 were synthesized. Thus, the carrot nuclei contained PI and PIP kinase as well as the polyphosphoinositides. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Lysophosphatidylinositol; Membrane; Nuclei; Phosphatidylinositol; Phosphoinositides",,,,,,,"Berridge, M.J., Inositol lipids and cell proliferation (1987) Biochim Biophys Acta, 907, pp. 33-45; Berridge, M.J., Irvine, R.F., Inositol trisphosphate, a novel second messenger in cellular signal transduction (1984) Nature, 312, pp. 315-321; Boss, W.F., (1987) Fusion-permissive protoplasts.

Polyamine titer was lowered in fusogenic wild carrot cells by treatment with α-difluoromethylarginine. This treatment resulted in a 50% inhibition of fusion after 4.5 h and 100% inhibition after 38 h of inhibitor treatment. Short- and long-term additions of exogenous polyamines did not restore fusion. Hence, polyamines are implicated in potentiating plasma-membrane fusion but clearly are not sufficient to induce biological membranes to fuse. An increase in the size and number of vacuoles was observed in the presence of α-difluoromethylarginine.

Free polyribosomes occurred within the Golgi apparatus zone for all dictyosomes and with equal frequency at all levels within the stack including the most mature or trans face. When evaluated and quantified from electron micrographs, approximately 60% of the dictyosome profiles were characterized by a system of transition elements consisting of part smooth-part rough endoplasmic reticulum. These were encountered most frequently in the immediate vicinity of the immature, forming or cis face, usually toward the periphery of the stacked cisternae. Analysis of serial sections showed that those dictyosome profiles not exhibiting this characteristic did so primarily because of an unfavorable plane of sectioning. All dictyosomes examined in 5 or more serial sections revealed some type of close association with endoplasmic reticulum. Some of the associations were so close that direct connections between Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum tubules could not be excluded. Also present, especially at the forming or cis face, were small 600 nm transition vesicles with nap-like surface coats on nearly 90% of the dictyosomes examined. More than 50% exhibited spiny (clathrin-)coated vesicles at the mature or trans face. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.","Endoplasmic reticulum; Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus-associated polyribosomes; Polyribosomes; Wild carrot (Daucus carota)",,,,,,,"Elder, J.H., Morré, D.J., Synthesis in vitro of intrinsic membrane proteins by free, membrane-bound, and Golgi apparatus-associated polyribosomes from rat liver (1976) J. biol.

Results show rapid incorporation of [3H] leucine into endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-, Golgi apparatus-, and plasma membrane/tonoplast-enriched fractions. The time lag between incorporation into ER and its appearance in Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane/tonoplast were less than 5 minutes. With an average time of 3-4 minutes for cisternal formation estimated from studies with monensin, and an average of 5 cisternae per dictyosome (total transit time of 15-20 minutes), it was not possible to account for early incorporation of radioactivity into plasma membranes by passage of proteins from ER to plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus. To account for the findings, it would appear that at least some proteins were delivered to the plasma membrane via the first membranes that exited (i.e., mature face vesicles) from the Golgi apparatus post-pulse and that some of these proteins had been translated and inserted into membranes at or near the mature face of the Golgi apparatus. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.","Carrot suspension cultures; Dictyosomes; Endoplasmic reticulum; Golgi apparatus; Membrane biogenesis; Plasma membrane",,,,,,,"Croze, E.M., Morré, D.J., Flow kinetics of mouse histocompatibility antigens (1981) Proc.

In contrast to human erythrocytes, plant protoplasts can be induced to undergo massive fusions by adding recrystallized PEG6000. ESR spectra of 5-doxylstearic acid (5DS)-labeled protoplasts indicate that PEG6000 (&gt; 20% w/v) causes a decrease in membrane fluidity and the appearance of a fluid signal indicating isotropic motion of the fatty acid spin label. The same ESR spectra are obtained if spin-labeled protoplasts are pretreated with glutaraldehyde. The 3-carboxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-1-oxyl derivative of poly(ethylene glycol) does not appear to intercalate into the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer, however, the apparent extraction of the 5DS-label from the protoplast membrane indicates that poly(ethylene glycol) can interact with membrane lipids. © 1983.","ESR; Glutaraldehyde; Membrane fluidity; Poly(ethylene glycol); Protoplast fusion",,,,,,,"Kao, Constabel, Michayluk, Gamborg, (1974) Planta, 120, pp. 215-227; Wallin, Glimelius, Eriksson, The induction of aggregation and fusion of Dancus carota protoplasts by polyethylene glycol (1974) Zeitschrift für Pflanzenphysiologie, 74, pp. 64-80; Dudits, Raski, Hadlaczky, Lima-de-Faria, (1976) Hereditas, 82, pp. 121-124; Jones, Mastranglo, Smith Liu, Meck, (1976) Science, 193, pp. 401-403; Honda, Maeda, Sasakawa, Ohno, Tsuchida, (1981) Biochem.

An average of one additional cisterna per stack was formed within the first 2 to 4 min of monensin treatment; in some experiments a second cisterna was formed within about 8 min. Thereafter, large vacuoles began to appear in the cytoplasm adjacent to the Golgi apparatus with a return of the number of cisternae per dictyosomal stack to the control number of about 5. Cells treated comparable but in the absence of monensin showed no ultrastructural changes during the entire observation period. By 1 h of monensin treatment, the regions of the cells containing dictyosomes were populated by large number of vacuoles (up to 20 or more per electron microscope section). These vacuoles were interpreted as swollen dictyosome cisternae that separated from the stack but had not migrated from the Golgi apparatus zone in the monensin-treated cells. The results permitted an estimation of the average time for formation of a new dictyosome cisterna of 2 to 4 min. This range of values agreed with estimates for mammalian cells from short time labeling and turnover experiments of 3 to 4 min assuming a dynamic model for Golgi apparatus function in which cisternae are released from a maturing face and new cisternae are built up at an opposite or forming face.",,"furan derivative; monensin; article; cell vacuole; comparative study; drug effect; electron microscopy; Golgi complex; plant; ultrastructure; Comparative Study; Furans; Golgi Apparatus; Microscopy, Electron; Monensin; Plants; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vacuoles",,"monensin, 17090-79-8, 22373-78-0; Furans; Monensin, 17090-79-8",,,,,"Morré, D.J.",,,,,,,,01719335,,,6852059,"English","Eur J Cell Biol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020732046
