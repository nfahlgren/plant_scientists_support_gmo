Among these varieties, R1-1 was identified as resistant, while R2, 8908B was susceptible to shatter. To understand the molecular basis for this phenotypic difference based on the candidate gene approach, B. napus FRUITFULL (FUL) homologs were identified and characterized. Two FUL loci in the A and C genomes of B. napus were identified. In the susceptible variety, both BnaA.FUL and BnaC.FUL were expressed in the same tissues. However, the expression level of BnaC.FUL differed in varieties with different pod shatter resistance. In the most resistant variety, R1-1, only BnaA.FUL was expressed, while BnaC.FUL was silenced. Therefore, the functional divergence and differing expression of BnaX. FUL homeologs may significantly affect phenotypic variation, which is an important consequence of allopolyploid evolution. This expression level divergence may be useful for selecting pod shatter resistant lines through marker-assisted selection in B. napus-breeding programs. © FUNPEC-RP.","Allopolyploid evolution; Expression divergence; FUL homeolog; Oilseed rape; Pod shattering","allopolyploidy; Article; Brassica oleracea; Brassica rapa; FRUITFULL gene; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene locus; gene sequence; gene silencing; genetic line; genetic selection; genetic variability; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; plant breeding; plant gene; plant genome; plant parameters; pod; pod shatter resistance; rapeseed; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sequence homology; Brassica napus",,,,,,"Adams, K.L., Cronn, R., Percifield, R., Wendel, J.F., Genes duplicated by polyploidy show unequal contributions to the transcriptome and organ-specific reciprocal silencing (2003) Proc.

We analyzed transcription and chromatin modifications at the ZCN8 locus and its nearly identical paralog ZCN7 during the floral transition. This analysis was performed with day-neutral maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), where flowering is promoted almost exclusively via the autonomous pathway through the activity of the regulatory gene indeterminate1 (id1), and tropical teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) under floral inductive and noninductive photoperiods. Comparison of ZCN7/ZCN8 histone modification profiles in immature leaves of nonflowering id1 mutants and teosinte grown under floral inhibitory photoperiods reveals that both id1 floral inductive activity and SD-mediated induction result in histone modification patterns that are compatible with the formation of transcriptionally competent chromatin environments. Specific histone modifications are maintained during leaf development and may represent a chromatin signature that favors the production of processed ZCN7/ZCN8 messenger RNA in florigen-producing mature leaf. However, whereas id1 function promotes histone H3 hyperacetylation, SD induction is associated with increased histone H3 dimethylation and trimethylation at lysine-4. In addition, id1 and SD differently affect the production of ZCN7/ZCN8 antisense transcript. These observations suggest that distinct mechanisms distinguish florigen regulation in response to autonomous and photoperiod pathways. Finally, the identical expression and histone modification profiles of ZCN7 and ZCN8 in response to floral induction suggest that ZCN7 may represent a second maize florigen. © 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

At the same time, increases in density tolerance through selective breeding and the concomitant ability to plant crops at a higher population density has been one of the most important factors in the development of high yielding modern cultivars.Results: Physiological changes underlying high density stress were examined in Oryza sativa plants over the course of a life cycle by assessing differences in gene expression and metabolism. Moreover, the nitrogen limitation was examined in parallel with high density stress to gain a better understanding of physiological responses specific to high density stress. While both nitrogen limitation and high density resulted in decreased shoot fresh weight, tiller number, plant height and chlorophyll content, high density stress alone had a greater impact on physiological factors. Decreases in aspartate and glutamate concentration were found in plants grown under both stress conditions; however, high density stress had a more significant effect on the concentration of these amino acids. Global transcriptome analysis revealed a large proportion of genes with altered expression in response to both stresses. The presence of ethylene-associated genes in a majority of density responsive genes was investigated further. Expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes ACC synthase 1, ACC synthase 2 and ACC oxidase 7 were found to be upregulated in plants under high density stress. Plants at high density were also found to up regulate ethylene-associated genes and senescence genes, while cytokinin response and biosynthesis genes were down regulated, consistent with higher ethylene production.Conclusions: High density stress has similar but greater impact on plant growth and development compared to nitrogen limitation. Global transcriptome changes implicate ethylene as a volatile signal used to communicate proximity in under dense population growth condition and suggest a role for phytohormones in high density stress response in rice plants. © 2014 Misyura et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Competition; Density; Ethylene; Gene expression; Microarray; Nitrogen; Rice; Stress","amino acid; aspartic acid; chlorophyll; cytokine; ethylene; glutamic acid; nitrogen; aspartic acid; ethylene; ethylene derivative; glutamic acid; nitrogen; ACC oxidase 7 gene; ACC synthase 1 gene; ACC synthase 2 gene; Article; chlorophyll content; controlled study; cytokine response; gene; gene expression; metabolism; nitrogen limitation; nonhuman; plant density; plant development; plant growth; plant height; plant stress; protein synthesis; rice; senescence; transcriptomics; upregulation; gene expression profiling; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolomics; physiological stress; physiology; plant gene; rice; Aspartic Acid; Ethylenes; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, Plant; Glutamic Acid; Metabolomics; Nitrogen; Oryza sativa; Stress, Physiological",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; aspartic acid, 56-84-8, 6899-03-2; chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; ethylene, 74-85-1; glutamic acid, 11070-68-1, 138-15-8, 56-86-0, 6899-05-4; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Aspartic Acid; ethylene; Ethylenes; Glutamic Acid; Nitrogen",,,,"Cattivelli, L., Rizza, F., Badeck, F.-W., Mazzucotelli, E., Mastrangelo, A.M., Francia, E., Mare, C., Stanca, A.M., Drought tolerance improvement in crop plants: an integrated view from breeding to genomics (2008) Field Crop Res, 105 (1), pp. 1-14; Robinson, R.A., Cowling, W., Return to resistance: breeding crops to reduce pesticide dependence (1996) Australas Plant Pathol, 25 (3), pp. 216-217; Vyn, T., Tollenaar, M., Changes in chemical and physical quality parameters of maize grain during three decades of yield improvement (1998) Field Crop Res, 59 (2), pp. 135-140; Carlone, M.R., Russell, W.A., Response to plant densities and nitrogen levels for four maize cultivars from different eras of breeding1 (1987) Crop Sci, 27 (3), pp. 465-470; Reilly, J.M., Fuglie, K.O., Future yield growth in field crops: what evidence exists?

Flowering in sugarcane is an important factor that negatively affects cane yield and reduces sugar/ethanol production from this important perennial bioenergy crop. Comparative studies have facilitated the identification and characterization of putative orthologs of key flowering time genes in sugarcane, a complex polyploid plant whose genome has yet to be sequenced completely. Using this approach we identified phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) gene family members in sugarcane that are similar to the archetypical FT and TFL1 genes of Arabidopsis that play an essential role in controlling the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. Expression analysis of ScTFL1, which falls into the TFL1-clade of floral repressors, showed transcripts in developing leaves surrounding the shoot apex but not at the apex itself. ScFT1 was detected in immature leaves and apical regions of vegetatively growing plants and, after the floral transition, expression also occurred in mature leaves. Ectopic over-expression of ScTFL1 in Arabidopsis caused delayed flowering in Arabidopsis, as might be expected for a gene related to TFL1. In addition, lines with the latest flowering phenotype exhibited aerial rosette formation. Unexpectedly, over-expression of ScFT1, which has greatest similarity to the florigen-encoding FT, also caused a delay in flowering. This preliminary analysis of divergent sugarcane FT and TFL1 gene family members from Saccharum spp. suggests that their expression patterns and roles in the floral transition has diverged from the predicted role of similar PEBP family members. © 2014 Coelho, Minow, Chalfun-Júnior and Colasanti.","Bioenergy crop; Floral induction; Florigen orthologs; FT-like genes; PEBP family; Saccharum spp.",,,,,,,"Abe, M., Kobayashi, Y., Yamamoto, S., Daimon, Y., Yamaguchi, A., Ikeda, Y., FD, a bZIP protein mediating signals from the floral pathway integrator FT at the shoot apex (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1052-1056. , doi: 10.1126/science.1115983; Abràmoff, M.D., Magalhães, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with ImageJ (2004) Biophotonics Intern., 11, pp. 36-42; Ahn, J.H., Miller, D., Winter, V.J., Banfield, M.J., Lee, J.H., Yoo, S.Y., A divergent external loop confers antagonistic activity on floral regulators FT and TFL1 (2006) Embo J., 25, pp. 605-614. , doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600950; Albani, M.C., Coupland, G., Comparative analysis of flowering in annual and perennial plants (2010) Plant Development, pp. 323-348. , in ed M.

In tomato, two MADS-box genes, JOINTLESS (J) and MACROCAYLYX (MC), have been shown to be implicated in development of the flower abscission zone (AZ), but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not well known. We report here that the SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS-box gene SLMBP21 acts as an additional factor for development of the AZ in tomato. We show that knockdown of SLMBP21 abolishes development of the flower AZ, while overexpression of SLMBP21 produces small cells at the proximal section of the pedicel and the peduncle. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis confirms that SLMBP21 interacts with J and MC, and co-immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrates that these three proteins may form higher-order protein complexes. In situ hybridization shows that SLMBP21, J, and MC transcripts accumulate in distinct regions, but overlap at the AZ vasculature. In addition, transactivation assays in yeast show that, of the three interacting proteins, only SLMBP21 can activate reporter gene transcription. RNA-seq analysis furthermore reveals that loss of function of SLMBP21, J, or MC affects a common subset of meristem activity genes including LeWUS and LATERAL SUPPRESSOR that were specifically expressed in the AZ on the tomato flower pedicel. Since SLMBP21 belongs to the FBP9/23 subclade of the SEP gene family, which is absent in Arabidopsis, the SLMBP21-J-MC complex may represent a distinct mechanism for development of the AZ in plants. © 2013 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","abscission zone; MADS-box gene; protein complex; SLMBP21; Solanum lycopersicum L; tomato","MADS-box genes; Protein complexes; SLMBP21; Solanum lycopersicum l; tomato; Fruits; Genes; Plants (botany); Proteins; Transcription; Arabidopsis; Lycopersicon esculentum; transactivator protein; vegetable protein; down regulation; flower; genetics; metabolism; physiology; plant gene; tomato; Down-Regulation; Flowers; Genes, Plant; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Proteins; Trans-Activators",,"Plant Proteins; Trans-Activators",,,,"Abe, M., Katsumata, H., Komeda, Y., Takahashi, T., Regulation of shoot epidermal cell differentiation by a pair of homeodomain proteins in Arabidopsis (2003) Development, 130, pp. 635-643; Ampomah-Dwamena, C., Morris, B.A., Sutherland, P., Veit, B., Yao, J.L., Down-regulation of TM29, a tomato SEPALLATA homolog, causes parthenocarpic fruit development and floral reversion (2002) Plant Physiol., 130, pp. 605-617; Basu, M.M., Gonzalez-Carranza, Z.H., Azam-Ali, S., Tang, S., Shahid, A.A., Roberts, J.A., The manipulation of auxin in the abscission zone cells of Arabidopsis flowers reveals that indoleacetic acid signaling is a prerequisite for organ shedding (2013) Plant Physiol., 162, pp. 96-106; Berger, Y., Harpaz-Saad, S., Brand, A., Melnik, H., Sirding, N., Alvarez, J.P., Zinder, M., Ori, N., The NAC-domain transcription factor GOBLET specifies leaflet boundaries in compound tomato leaves (2009) Development, 136, pp. 823-832; Bleecker, A.B., Patterson, S.E., Last exit: Senescence, abscission, and meristem arrest in Arabidopsis (1997) Plant Cell, 9, pp. 1169-1179; Brewer, P.B., Heisler, M.G., Hejatko, J., Friml, J., Benkova, E., In situ hybridization for mRNA detection in Arabidopsis tissue sections (2006) Nat.

An Asymetrix 82K maize array was used to analyze the expression of ≤ 46 unique nitrogen uptake and assimilation probes in 50 maize tissues from seedling emergence to 31 d after pollination. Four nitrogen-related expression clusters were identified in roots and shoots corresponding to, or overlapping, juvenile, adult, and reproductive phases of development. Quantitative real time PCR data was consistent with the existence of these distinct expression clusters. Promoters corresponding to each cluster were screened for over-represented cis-acting elements. The 8-bp distal motif of the Arabidopsis 43-bp nitrogen response element (NRE) was over-represented in nitrogen-related maize gene promoters. This conserved motif, referred to here as NRe43-d8, was previously shown to be critical for nitrate-activated transcription of nitrate reeducates (NIa1) and nitrite reeducates (NIR1) by the NIN-Like Protein 6 (NLP6) in Arabidopsis. here, NRe43-d8 was over-represented in the promoters of maize nitrate and ammonium transporter genes, specifically those that showed peak expression during early-stage vegetative development. This result predicts an expansion of the NRe-NLP6 regulon and suggests that it may have a developmental component in maize. We also report leaf expression of putative orthologs of nitrite transporters (NiTR1), a transporter not previously reported in maize. We conclude by discussing how each of the four transcriptional modules may be responsible for the different nitrogen uptake and assimilation requirements of leaves and roots at different stages of maize development. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.","Adult; Assimilation; E-box; G-box; Juvenile; Maize; Motif; Nitrate response element; Nitrite transporter; Nitrogen; NRE; Phase change; Promoter; Transcriptome; Transporter; Zea mays","nitrogen; transcriptome; transporter; vegetable protein; adult; article; assimilation; chemistry; E-box; G-box; gene expression regulation; genetics; juvenile; maize; metabolism; motif; nitrate response element; nitrite transporter; NRE; phase change; promoter region; adult; assimilation; E-box; G-box; juvenile; maize; motif; nitrate response element; nitrite transporter; nitrogen; NRE; phase change; promoter; transcriptome; transporter; Zea mays; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Zea mays",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Crawford, N.M., Glass, A.D.M., Molecular and physiological aspects of nitrate uptake in plants (1998) Trends Plant Sci, 3, pp. 389-395. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1360-1385(98)01311-9; Gaudin, A.C.M., McClymont, S.A., Raizada, M.N., The nitrogen adaptation strategy of the wild teosinte ancestor of modern maize, Zea mays subsp parvi-glumis (2011) Crop Sci, 51, pp. 2780-2795. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2010.12.0686; Kant, S., Bi, Y.-M., Rothstein, S.J., Understanding plant response to nitrogen limitation for the improvement of crop nitrogen use efficiency (2011) J Exp Bot, 62, pp. 1499-1509. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq297, PMID:20926552; Masclaux-Daubresse, C., Daniel-Vedele, F., Dechorgnat, J., Chardon, F., Gaufichon, L., Suzuki, A., Nitrogen uptake, assimilation and remobilization in plants: Challenges for sustainable and productive agriculture (2010) Ann Bot, 105, pp. 1141-1157. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq028, PMID:20299346; Li, P., Ponnala, L., Gandotra, N., Wang, L., Si, Y., Tausta, S.L., Kebrom, T.H., Myers, C.R., The developmental dynamics of the maize leaf transcrip-tome (2010) Nat Genet, 42, pp. 1060-1067. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.703, PMID:21037569; Dechorgnat, J., Nguyen, C.T., Armengaud, P., Jossier, M., Diatloff, E., Filleur, S., Daniel-Vedele, F., From the soil to the seeds: The long journey of nitrate in plants (2011) J Exp Bot, 62, pp. 1349-1359. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq409, PMID:21193579; Forde, B.G., Nitrate transporters in plants: Structure, function and regulation (2000) Biochim Biophys Acta -Biomembranes, 1465, pp. 219-235; Quaggiotti, S., Ruperti, B., Borsa, P., Destro, T., Malagoli, M., Expression of a putative high-affinity NO3- transporter and of an H+ATPase in relation to whole plant nitrate transport physiology in two maize genotypes differently responsive to low nitrogen availability (2003) J Exp Bot, 54, pp. 1023-1031. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erg106, PMID:12598572; Quaggiotti, S., Ruperti, B., Pizzeghello, D., Francioso, O., Tugnoli, V., Nardi, S., Effect of low molecular size humic substances on nitrate uptake and expression of genes involved in nitrate transport in maize (Zea mays L.)

Although grass flowering processes include ancestral functions shared by both mono- and dicots, they have developed their own mechanisms to transmit floral induction signals. Despite its high production capacity and its important role in biofuel production, almost no information is available about the flowering process in sugarcane. We searched the Sugarcane Expressed Sequence Tags database to look for elements of the flowering signaling pathway under photoperiodic control. Sequences showing significant similarity to flowering time genes of other species were clustered, annotated, and analyzed for conserved domains. Multiple alignments comparing the sequences found in the sugarcane database and those from other species were performed and their phylogenetic relationship assessed using the MEGA 4.0 software. Electronic Northerns were run with Cluster and TreeView programs, allowing us to identify putative members of the photoperiod-controlled flowering pathway of sugarcane. ©FUNPEC-RP.","Biomass yield; Floral induction; Flowering time genes; Photoperiodism; Saccharum spp; SUCEST","article; COL1 gene; COL10 gene; COL5 gene; COL6 gene; controlled study; DNA sequence; EHD1 gene; expressed sequence tag; flowering; FT gene; gene identification; genetic database; GHD7 gene; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; photoperiodicity; plant gene; process development; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; signal transduction; sugarcane; terminal flower 1 gene; ZCN8 gene; Databases, Genetic; Expressed Sequence Tags; Flowers; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Photoperiod; Phylogeny; Saccharum; Signal Transduction; Arabidopsis; Dicotyledoneae; Saccharum","GENBANK: AAF00092, AAF03936, AAL08497, AAL99264, AAL99266, AAL99267, AAL99270, AAM74069, AAZ86536, ABF95340, ABR26000, ABW82153, ABW96224, ABW96236, ABW96237, ABW96241, ABW96244, ABX11010, ABX11026, ABZ81992, ACA14489, ACC85612, ACF35275, ACM49849, AD490474, ADO51647, ADX60157, ADX60172, AF469490, BAD68052, BAD68053, BAD73176, BAF15064, BAI59731, CAB45058, DAA06172, NP_174126, NP_187422, NP_193260, NP_195607, NP_199636",,,,,"Baurle, I., Dean, C., The timing of developmental transitions in plants (2006) Cell, 125, pp. 655-664; Bernier, G., Perilleux, C., A physiological overview of the genetics of flowering time control (2005) Plant Biotechnol.

We examined transcript abundance data at 50 developmental stages, from embryogenesis to senescence, for 34,876 gene models and classified genes into 24 robust coexpression modules. Modules were strongly associated with tissue types and related biological processes. Sixteen of the 24 modules (67%) have preferential transcript abundance within specific tissues. Onethird of modules had an absence of gene expression in specific tissues. Genes within a number of modules also correlated with the developmental age of tissues. Coexpression of genes is likely due to transcriptional control. For a number of modules, key genes involved in transcriptional control have expression profiles that mimic the expression profiles of module genes, although the expression of transcriptional control genes is not unusually representative of module gene expression. Known regulatory motifs are enriched in several modules. Finally, of the 13 network modules with more than 200 genes, three contain genes that are notably clustered (P,< 0.05) within the genome. This work, based on a carefully selected set of major tissues representing diverse stages of maize development, demonstrates the remarkable power of transcript-level coexpression networks to identify underlying biological processes and their molecular components. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Anthocyanin production is a characteristic response of flowering plants to unfavourable environmental conditions. The potential roles of flavonoids and anthocyanins in plant growth were investigated by growing Arabidopsis thaliana anthocyanin production mutants (transparent testa) under limiting nitrogen and high light conditions. Inability to produce kaempferol or subsequent intermediate compounds by some transparent testa lines was correlated with less biomass accumulation in mature plants compared with wild-type control plants under all growth conditions tested. However, under both limiting nitrogen and high light chronic stress conditions, mutant lines defective in later steps of the anthocyanin production pathway produced the same or more biomass than wild-type plants. No difference in senescence between transparent testa and wild-type plants was found using chlorophyll catabolism and SAG12 expression measurements, and no mutants were impaired in the ability to remobilize nutrients from the vegetative to reproductive tissues. Moreover, the absence of anthocyanin and/or upstream flavonoids does not affect the ability of plants to respond to limiting nitrogen by reducing photosynthetic capacity. These results support a role for kaempferol and quercetin accumulation in normal plant growth and development. Further, the absence of anthocyanins has no effect on plant growth under the chronic stress conditions tested. © 2012 The Author.

The INDETERMINATE1 (ID1) transcription factor is a key regulator of the transition to flowering in day-neutral maize. The ID1 gene is expressed exclusively in developing leaves, where it controls the production or transmission of leaf-derived florigenic signals. Florigen-producing source leaves were compared with mature leaves of late-flowering id1 plants, and metabolite and gene expression differences associated with the floral transition in maize were observed. While id1 mutants have a similar capacity for photosynthesis to wild-type siblings, id1 source leaves show quantitative differences in carbohydrate allocation prior to the floral transition stage, with a marked increase in sucrose and other soluble sugars, accompanied by a decrease in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle organic acids. Importantly, source leaves of autonomous-flowering maize are typified by a higher transitory starch to sucrose ratio and a transcript profile enriched for sucrose synthesis and starch metabolism-related gene function. Finally, similar changes in transitory starch and sucrose are not observed in teosinte, the tropical progenitor of maize that requires short-day photoperiods to induce flowering. Together, these data define a transcript and metabolite signature associated with the autonomous floral transition in temperate maize leaves. © [2012] The Author.","Autonomous floral transition; indeterminate1; maize; source leaf; teosinte; transcript and metabolite","carbon; florigen; Id1 protein, plant; starch; sucrose; transcription factor; transcriptome; vegetable protein; article; citric acid cycle; cytology; flower; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; maize; mass fragmentography; metabolism; photoperiodicity; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; transmission electron microscopy; Carbon; Citric Acid Cycle; Florigen; Flowers; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Photoperiod; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Starch; Sucrose; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Florigen; Id1 protein, plant; Plant Proteins; Starch, 9005-25-8; Sucrose, 57-50-1; Transcription Factors",,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Bush, D.R., Carbohydrate export from the leaf: A highly regulated process and target to enhance photosynthesis and productivity (2011) Plant Physiology, 155, pp. 64-69; Amasino, R., Seasonal and developmental timing of flowering (2010) The Plant Journal, 61, pp. 1001-1013; Aoki, N., Hirose, T., Takahashi, S., Ono, K., Ishimaru, K., Ohsugi, R., Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a gene for a sucrose transporter maize (Zea mays L.)

The action of SHR and SCR is regulated by two INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) family proteins, JACKDAW (JKD) and MAGPIE (MGP). Although the reciprocal interaction of these transcription factors is considered to be involved in the modulation of SHR and SCR action by JKD and MGP, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we use a transient assay with Arabidopsis culture cells to show that the physical interaction of these transcription factors modulate their transcriptional activity. Transient expression of LUC reporter genes with the proximal sequences upstream from the ATG codon of SCR and MGP in protoplasts were activated by JKD. Moreover, promoter activities were enhanced further by the addition of SHR and SCR to JKD, but not by the combination of SHR and SCR in the absence of JKD. Yeast one-hybrid analysis showed that JKD binds to the SCR and MGP promoter sequences, indicating the existence of another binding sequences of JKD different from the previously determined IDD binding sequence. Our findings suggest that JKD directly regulates SCR and MGP expression in cooperation with SHR, SCR and MGP. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","IDD family; JACKDAW; MAGPIE; Roots; SCARECROW;

Physiological studies show that florigen is a mobile factor that transmits floral inductive signals from the leaf to the shoot apex. Arabidopsis FT protein is widely regarded as the archetype florigen found in diverse plant species, particularly in plants that use inductive photoperiods to flower. Recently, a large family of FT homologues in maize, the Zea CENTRORADIALIS (ZCN) genes, was described, suggesting that maize also contains FT-related proteins that act as a florigen. The product of one member of this large family, ZCN8, has several attributes that make it a good candidate as a maize florigen. Mechanisms underlying the floral transition in maize are less well understood than those of other species, partly because flowering in temperate maize is dependent largely on endogenous signals. The maize indeterminate1 (id1) gene is an important regulator of maize autonomous flowering that acts in leaves to mediate the transmission or production of florigenic signals. This study finds that id1 acts upstream of ZCN8 to control its expression, suggesting a possible new link to flowering in day-neutral maize. Moreover, in teosinte, a tropical progenitor of maize that requires short-day photoperiods to induce flowering, ZCN8 is highly up-regulated in leaves under inductive photoperiods. Finally, vascular-specific expression of ZCN8 in Arabidopsis complements the ft-1 mutation, demonstrating that leaf-specific expression of ZCN8 can induce flowering. These results suggest that ZCN8 may encode a florigen that integrates both endogenous and environmental signals in maize. © 2011 The Author.","florigen; FT orthologue; long-distance signalling; maize;

One mechanism for this interaction involves epigenetic modifications that affect a number of aspects of plant growth and development. Thus, the epigenome is highly dynamic in response to environmental cues and developmental changes. Flowering is controlled by a set of genes that are affected by environmental conditions through an alteration in their expression pattern. This ensures the production of flowers even when plants are growing under adverse conditions, and thereby enhances transgenerational seed production. In this review recent findings on the epigenetic changes associated with flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana grown under abiotic stress conditions such as cold, drought, and high salinity are discussed. These epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the production of micro RNAs (miRNAs) that mediate epigenetic modifications. The roles played by the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin in chromatin remodelling are also discussed. It is shown that there is a crucial relationship between the epigenetic modifications associated with floral initiation and development and modifications associated with stress tolerance. This relationship is demonstrated by the common epigenetic pathways through which plants control both flowering and stress tolerance, and can be used to identify new epigenomic players. © 2011 The Author(s).","Epigenetics;

How Id1 is integrated into the flowering process is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the genetic action of the rice (Oryza sativa) ortholog OsId1. In rice, OsId1 is preferentially expressed in young leaves, but the overall expression pattern is broader than that in maize (Zea mays). OsId1 is able to activate transcription in yeast. RNAi mutants show a delay in flowering under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions. OsId1 regulates the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) and its downstream genes, including Hd3a (a rice ortholog of FT) and RFT1 (Rice Flowering Locus T1), under both SD and LD conditions. In rice, the expression of Ehd1 is also controlled by the photoperiodic flowering genes OsGI (a rice ortholog of GI) and OsMADS51. However, the expression of OsId1 is independent of OsGI, OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 (a rice SOC1 ortholog). This study demonstrates that the activation of Ehd1 by OsId1 is required for the promotion of flowering. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Ehd1 (early heading date 1); Flowering; Indeterminate 1 (Id1); Maize; Rice","Id1 protein, plant; plant RNA; transcription factor; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; article; flower; gene expression regulation; genetic transformation; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; photoperiodicity; plant gene; plant leaf; rice; RNA interference; sequence alignment; transgenic plant; Amino Acid Sequence; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Oryza sativa; Photoperiod; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA Interference; RNA, Plant; Sequence Alignment; Transcription Factors; Transformation, Genetic; Oryza sativa; Zea mays",,"Id1 protein, plant; Plant Proteins; RNA, Plant; Transcription Factors",,,,"Bernier, G., Perilleux, C., A physiological overview of the genetics of flowering time control (2005) Plant Biotechnol.

Loss of SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 5 (SGR5) gene function has been shown to affect the gravitropic response of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems. SGR5 is a member of the INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) zinc finger protein family of putative transcription factors. As part of an ongoing functional analysis of Arabidopsis IDD genes (AtIDD) we have extended the characterisation of SGR5, and show that gravity sensing amyloplasts in the shoot endodermis of sgr5 mutants sediment more slowly than wild type, suggesting a defect in gravity perception. This is correlated with lower amyloplast starch levels, which may account for the reduced gravitropic sensitivity in sgr5. Further, we find that sgr5 mutants have a severely attenuated stem circumnutation movement typified by a reduced amplitude and an decreased periodicity. adg1-1 and sex1-1 mutants, which contain no starch or increased starch, respectively, also show alterations in the amplitude and period of circumnutation. Together these results suggest that plant growth movement may depend on starch levels and/or gravity sensing. Overall, we propose that loss of SGR5 regulatory activity affects starch accumulation in Arabidopsis shoot tissues and causes decreased sensitivity to gravity and diminished circumnutational movements. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Amyloplast;

N1G 2W1, Canada","The INDETERMINATE1 (ID1) transcription factor is a key regulator of the transition to flowering in maize. ID1 is expressed in immature leaves where it controls the production or transmission of leaf-derived florigenic signals. Loss-of-function id1 mutants make many more leaves than normal plants and produce aberrant flowers; however, they exhibit no obvious developmental defects in early growth stages. A maize oligonucleotide microarray was used to assess the molecular differences between immature leaves of wild-type and id1 mutant plants prior to the floral transition. This analysis revealed 55 genes with a significant 2-fold difference in expression; 22 are down-regulated and 33 are up-regulated in id1 mutants. Most prominent is a novel family of three β-glucosidase genes that are most closely related to sorghum dhurrinases. These genes, termed Zmdhr1, Zmdhr2, and Zmdhr3, are undetectable in immature leaves of id1 mutants and are expressed exclusively in normal immature leaves in a pattern identical to the ID1 gene. Other down-regulated genes include a group of four zinc finger protein-encoding genes that are unrelated to ID1. A significant number of genes up-regulated in id1 mutant immature leaves have potential roles in photosynthesis and carbon fixation, substantiating a possible connection between floral induction and assimilate partitioning. Finally, expression of these genes was compared in florally induced versus uninduced teosinte, a photoperiod-sensitive progenitor of day-neutral maize. Only a few genes showed expression differences, suggesting that ID1 acts in a novel autonomous floral induction pathway that is distinct from the photoperiod induction pathway. © 2007 The Author(s).","Comparative expression; Floral regulator; Long-distance signalling; Maize; Molecular profiling; Plant metabolism; Teosinte; Transcription factor","Comparative expression; Floral regulator; Molecular profiling; Plant metabolism; Crops; Enzyme activity; Gene encoding; Growth kinetics; Metabolism; Microarrays; Oligonucleotides; Transcription; Id1 protein, plant; transcription factor; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; article; chemistry; down regulation; flower; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; maize; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; phylogeny; physiology; upregulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Down-Regulation; Flowers; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors; Up-Regulation; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"Id1 protein, plant; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,"Abe M, Kobayashi Y, Yamamoto S, Daimon Y, Yamaguchi A, Ikeda Y, Ichinoki H, Notaguchi M, Goto K, Araki T. 2005.

N1G 2W1, Canada","The INDETERMINATE1 gene, ID1, encodes a putative transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating the transition to flowering in maize. Mutant id1 plants have a prolonged vegetative growth phase and fail to make normal flowers. The ID1 gene, which encodes a nuclear-localized zinc finger protein, is expressed exclusively in immature leaves, suggesting that ID1 regulates a leaf-derived floral inductive signal. It is shown by western analysis with anti-ID1-specific antibody that ID1 co-localizes with ID1 mRNA in developing, immature leaves and, similarly, is absent in mature, photosynthetically active leaf blades, as well as the shoot apical meristem. Immunolocalization with anti-ID1 antibody shows that ID1 protein is detected in the nuclei of all cell types in immature leaves. Examination of plants grown in different day/night cycles revealed that ID1 gene expression and protein levels are largely unaffected by variations in light and dark, and that mRNA and protein levels do not follow a circadian pattern. The absence of ID1 expression in greening leaf tips coincides with the sink-to-source transition of developing leaves. It was found that ID1 levels are down-regulated in mature albino leaves similarly as in normal green leaves, suggesting that ID1 activity is controlled developmentally and is not affected by the sink/source status of the leaf or the inability of a mature leaf to engage in photosynthesis. The finding that ID1 expression is developmentally regulated and is unperturbed by external stimuli such as photoperiod supports the supposition that ID1 acts through the autonomous floral inductive pathway in maize. © The Author [2006].

The zinc fingers and surrounding sequence make up the signature ID domain (IDD), which appears to be found in all higher plant genomes. The presence of zinc finger domains and previous biochemical studies showing that ID 1 binds to DNA suggests that members of this gene family are involved in transcriptional regulation. Results: Comparison of IDD genes identified in Arabidopsis and rice genomes, and all IDD genes discovered in maize EST and genomic databases, suggest that ID 1 is a unique member of this gene family. High levels of sequence similarity amongst all IDD genes from maize, rice and Arabidopsis suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor. Several unique features of ID 1 suggest that it is a divergent member of the maize IDD family. Although no clear ID 1 ortholog was identified in the Arabidopsis genome, highly similar genes that encode proteins with identity extending beyond the ID domain were isolated from rice and sorghum. Phylogenetic comparisons show that these putative orthologs, along with maize ID 1, form a group separate from other IDD genes. In contrast to ID 1 mRNA, which is detected exclusively in immature leaves, several maize IDD genes showed a broad range of expression in various tissues. Further, Western analysis with an antibody that cross-reacts with ID 1 protein and potential orthologs from rice and sorghum shows that all three proteins are detected in immature leaves only. Conclusion: Comparative genomic analysis shows that the IDD zinc finger family is highly conserved among both monocots and dicots. The leaf-specific ID 1 expression pattern distinguishes it from other maize IDD genes examined. A similar leaf-specific localization pattern was observed for the putative ID 1 protein orthologs from rice and sorghum. These similarities between ID 1 and closely related genes in other grasses point to possible similarities in function. © 2006 Colansanti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"messenger RNA; protein antibody; protein indeterminate 1; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; controlled study; cross reaction; expressed sequence tag; flowering; gene identification; gene isolation; genetic conservation; genome analysis; immaturity; maize; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; plant genetics; plant leaf; protein domain; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; regulatory mechanism; rice; sequence analysis; sequence homology; sorghum; Western blotting; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Conserved Sequence; DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; Flowers; Gene Library; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Seedling; Sequence Alignment; Transcription Factors; Zea mays; Zinc Fingers; Arabidopsis; Dicotyledoneae; Embryophyta; Liliopsida; Poaceae; Zea mays","GENBANK: AF058757, AY754864, AY754865, AY754866, AY754867, X82328","DNA Primers; DNA, Plant; IDS1 protein, Zea mays; Plant Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Transcription Factors",,,,"Arabidopsis, G.I., Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant.

N1G 2W1, Canada","The INDETERMINATE protein, ID1, plays a key role in regulating the transition to flowering in maize. ID1 is the founding member of a plant-specific zinc finger protein family that is defined by a highly conserved amino sequence called the ID domain. The ID domain includes a cluster of three different types of zinc fingers separated from a fourth C2H2 finger by a long spacer; ID1 is distinct from other ID domain proteins by having a much longer spacer. In vitro DNA selection and amplification binding assays and DNA binding experiments showed that ID1 binds selectively to an 11 bp consensus motif via the ID domain. Unexpectedly, site-directed mutagenesis of the ID1 protein showed that zinc fingers located at each end of the ID domain are not required for binding to the consensus motif despite the fact that one of these zinc fingers is a canonical C2H2 DNA binding domain. In addition, an ID1 in vitro deletion mutant that lacks the extra spacer between zinc fingers binds the same 11 bp motif as normal ID1, suggesting that all ID domain-containing proteins recognize the same DNA target sequence. Our results demonstrate that maize ID1 and ID domain proteins have novel zinc finger configurations with unique DNA binding properties. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",,"inhibitor of differentiation 1; regulator protein; spacer DNA; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; DNA; DNA binding protein; Id1 protein, plant; transcription factor; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; article; binding assay; controlled study; deletion mutant; DNA binding; DNA binding motif; flowering; gene amplification; gene targeting; in vitro study; maize; molecular recognition; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein localization; site directed mutagenesis; binding site; chemistry; consensus sequence; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; protein binding; Zea mays; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Consensus Sequence; DNA; DNA-Binding Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Proteins; Protein Binding; Transcription Factors; Zinc Fingers",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA-Binding Proteins; Id1 protein, plant; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,"Bieker, J.J., Kruppel-like factors: Three fingers in many pies (2001) J.

In maize, there are several distinct stages: the transition from vegetative growth to flowering, the elaboration of the inflorescence, and the formation of flowers. Progress in understanding meristem identity and function has been made by analyzing maize mutants with defects at each of these stages. Recently cloned genes suggest that, although the molecular mechanisms controlling floral organ identity are conserved in maize and other model species, the control of meristem identity during earlier developmental stages might be less conserved.",,"cloned gene; flowering; maize; mutant; plant model; Genes, Plant; Zea mays; Zea mays",,,,,,"Irish, E.E., Nelson, T.M., Identification of multiple stages in the conversion of maize meristems from vegetative to floral development (1991) Development, 112, pp. 891-898; Evans, M.M.S., Barton, M.K., Genetics of angiosperm shoot apical meristem development (1997) Annu.

We describe here the isolation of cDNA clones encoding four putative mitotic cyclins from maize. All four cyclins were able to induce maturation of Xenopus oocytes, demonstrating that they can act as mitotic cyclins in this system. Northern analysis showed that all four cyclins were expressed only in actively dividing tissues and organs, with a stronger correlation between expression and mitotic activity than is observed with cdc2. The deduced protein sequences suggest that the four maize cyclins belong to the cyclin A and B families identified from animal and yeast studies but that they cannot be described easily as either A-type or B-type cyclins. However, comparison with previously cloned plant cyclins shows that cyclins in higher plants form three distinct structural groups that have been conserved in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species and that cyclins from all three groups are present within a single plant species.","cdc2; cell division; Zea mays","cycline; article; maize; mitosis; molecular cloning; nonhuman; oocyte; phytochemistry; priority journal; protein analysis; xenopus; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal; Cloning, Molecular; Cyclins; Female; Mitosis; Molecular Sequence Data; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Xenopus laevis; Zea mays; Animalia; Embryophyta; Zea mays","GENBANK: U10076, U10077, U10078, U10079","Cyclins",,,,,"Sundaresan, V.; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, United States",,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,8041798,"English","PROC.

The microtubule cytoskeletal structure of plant cells was visualized concomitantly with a monoclonal antibody specific for α-tubulin. We found that the cdc2 protein is localized mainly to the nucleus in plant cells at interphase and early prophase. This finding contrasts markedly with the predominantly cytoplasmic staining obtained using antibody to the PSTAIRE motif, which is common to cdc2 and numerous cdc2-like proteins. In a subpopulation of root cells at early prophase, the p34cdc2 protein is also distributed in a band bisecting the nucleus. Double labeling with the maize p34cdc2Zm antibody and tubulin antibody revealed that this band colocalizes with the preprophase band (PPB) of microtubules, which predicts the future division site. Root cells in which microtubules had been disrupted with oryzalin did not contain this band of p34cdc2 protein, suggesting that formation of the microtubule PPB is necessary for localization of the p34cdc2 kinase to the plane of the PPB. The p34cdc2 protein is also localized to the nucleus and PPB in cells that give rise to the stomatal complex, including those cells preparing for the highly asymmetrical divisions that produce subsidiary cells. Association of the p34cdc2 protein with the PPB suggests that the cdc2 kinase has a role in establishing the division site of plant cells and, therefore, a role in plant morphogenesis.",,"Zea mays",,,,,,,"Sundaresan, V.; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, United States",,,,,,,,10404651,,PLCEE,,"English","Plant Cell",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001292316

Complete digestion is possible using a vast excess of enzyme; under these conditions, the rate of HinfI digestion for cytosine methylated DNA is at least 1440-fold slower than for unmethylated DNA. The presence of an additional methylated cytosine at the degenerate position internal to the recognition sequence does not appear to increase the resistance to HinfI digestion. We also tested HhaII, an isoschizomer of HinfI, and found that it is completely inactive on cytosine methylated DNA.

To differentiate their respective functions, oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was used to change the ATG start codon of the φX174 A* gene, previously cloned into pCQV2 under λ repressor control, into a TAG stop codon. The altered A* gene was then inserted back into φX replicative form DNA to produce an amber mutant, φXamA*. Two different Escherichia coli amber suppressor strains infected with this mutant produced viable progeny phage with only a slight reduction in yield. In Su+ cells infected with φXamA*, φX gene A protein, altered at one amino acid, was synthesized at normal levels; A* protein was not detectable. These observations indicate that the A* protein increases the replicative efficiency of the phage, perhaps by shutting down host DNA replication, but is not required for replication of φX174 DNA or the packaging of the viral strand under the conditions tested. © 1987.",,"virus protein; article; bacteriophage phi X 174; codon; DNA replication; Escherichia coli; genetics; molecular cloning; mutation; physiology; virus gene; virus replication; Bacteriophage phi X 174; Cloning, Molecular; Codon; DNA Replication; Escherichia coli; Genes, Viral; Mutation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Viral Proteins; Virus Replication",,"Codon; Viral Proteins",,,,"Aoyama, Hayashi, (1986) Cell, 47, pp. 99-106; Aoyama, Hamatake, Hayashi, (1983) Proc.

In order to enhance expression of the Rep protein, the rep gene was cloned into the vector pKC30 under the control of the λpL promoter. By trimming away a portion of the DNA sequence immediately upstream of the translational start site of rep, we were able to obtain very high levels of Rep protein upon induction. Cells carrying such plasmids showed no ill effects from the high concentration of the protein. To ascertain the consequence of the absence of Rep protein on the cell, the chromosomal copy of the gene was deleted using a homologous recombination technique. The viability of E. coli strains completely lacking the rep gene proves that the Rep function is not essential, at least in wild-type cells under laboratory conditions. We confirmed that in the absence of Rep function there is an increase in the average number of growing forks in exponentially growing cells; augmentation of Rep protein levels above normal, however, did not detectably decrease the number of growing forks. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Deletion mutagenesis; DNA helicase; Rep protein; Replication forks; Translational control","adenosine triphosphatase; dna dependent adenosinetriphosphatase; DNA-dependent ATPase; article; bacterial gene; enzymology; Escherichia coli; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; mutation; nucleotide sequence; plasmid; structural gene; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Base Sequence; Escherichia coli; Genes, Bacterial; Genes, Structural; Mutation; Plasmids; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"adenosine triphosphatase, 37289-25-1, 9000-83-3; Adenosinetriphosphatase, EC 3.6.1.3; DNA-dependent ATPase, EC 3.6.1.-; Plasmids",,,,"Bialkowska-Hobrzanska, H., Denhardt, D.T., Cloning and analysis of the functional rep gene of E. coli K12 (1984) Gene, 28, pp. 93-102; Bialkowska-Hobrzanska, H., Gilchrist, C.A., Denhardt, D.T., Identification of the promoter and N-terminus of the Rep protein (1985) J Bacteriol, 164, pp. 1004-1010; Bridges, B.A., von Wright, A., Influence of mutations at the rep gene on survival of Escherichia coli following ultraviolet light irradiation or 8-methoxypsoralen photosensitization (1981) Mutat Res, 82, pp. 229-238; Colasanti, J., Denhardt, D.T., Expression of the cloned ϕX174 A* gene in E. coli inhibits DNA replication and cell division (1985) J Virol, 53, pp. 807-813; Cooper, S., Weusthoff, G., Comment on the use of chloramphenicol to study the initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis (1971) J Bacteriol, 106, pp. 709-711; RW, (1980) Advanced bacterial genetics, , R.W., Davis, D., Botstein, J.R., Roth, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York; Denhardt, D.T., Iwaya, M., Larison, L.L., The rep mutation II.

Upon induction of expression, DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli carrying the recombinant plasmid is severely inhibited; however, these same cells permit β-galactosidase induction at a rate similar to that observed in control cells at the inducing (for A ) temperature. Cells in which A is expressed form filaments and produce more RecA protein, indicating at least a partial induction of the SOS response; however, there is no evidence of damage to the bacterial chromosome.
