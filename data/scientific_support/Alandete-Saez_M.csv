In Arabidopsis, the functional megaspore undergoes three syncitial mitotic divisions followed by cellularization to form seven cells of four cell types including two female gametes. The plant hormone auxin is important for sporophytic developmental processes, and auxin levels are known to be regulated by biosynthesis and transport. Here, we investigated the role of auxin biosynthetic genes and auxin influx carriers in embryo sac development. We find that genes from the YUCCA/TAA pathway (YUC1, YUC2, YUC8, TAA1, TAR2) are expressed asymmetrically in the developing ovule and embryo sac from the two-nuclear syncitial stage until cellularization. Mutants for YUC1 and YUC2 exhibited defects in cell specification, whereas mutations in YUC8, as well as mutations in TAA1 and TAR2, caused defects in nuclear proliferation, vacuole formation and anisotropic growth of the embryo sac. Additionally, expression of the auxin influx carriers AUX1 and LAX1 were observed at the micropylar pole of the embryo sac and in the adjacent cells of the ovule, and the aux1 lax1 lax2 triple mutant shows multiple gametophyte defects. These results indicate that both localized auxin biosynthesis and auxin import, are required for mitotic divisions, cell expansion and patterning during embryo sac development. © 2015 Panoli et al.",,"auxin;

From its inception, PIPRA has worked broadly to support a wide range of research in the public sector, in specialty and minor acreage crops as well as crops important to food security in developing countries. In this paper, we review PIPRA's work, discussing the failures, successes, and lessons learned during its years of operation. To address public sector's limited freedom-to-operate, or legal access to third-party rights, in the area of plant transformation, we describe PIPRA's patent 'pool' approach to develop open-access technologies for plant transformation which consolidate patent and tangible property rights in marker-free vector systems. The plant transformation system has been licensed and deployed for both commercial and humanitarian applications in the United States (US) and Africa, respectively. © 2012 The Authors.

Here we show that GEX1 is also expressed in the embryo sac before cellularization, in the egg cell after cellularization, in the zygote/embryo immediately after fertilization and in the pollen vegetative cell. We functionally characterize GEX1 in Arabidopsis thaliana, and show that it is a versatile protein that performs functions during male and female gametophyte development, and during early embryogenesis. gex1-1/+ plants, which synthesize a truncated GEX1 mRNA encoding a protein lacking the predicted cytoplasmic domain, but still targeted to the plasma membrane, had embryos that arrested before the pre-globular stage. gex1-3/+ plants, carrying a null GEX1 allele, had defects during male and female gametophyte development, and during early embryogenesis. Using an antisense GEX1 transgenic line we demonstrate that the predicted GEX1 extracellular domain is sufficient and necessary for GEX1 function during the development of both gametophytes. The predicted cytoplasmic domain is necessary for correct early embryogenesis and mediates homodimer formation at the plasma membrane. We propose that dimerization of GEX1 in the zygote might be an upstream step in a signaling cascade regulating early embryogenesis. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","antisense; BiFC; dimerization; embryo lethal; embryo sac; plasma membrane protein; pollen","Antisense; BiFC; embryo lethal; Embryo sac; plasma membrane protein; pollen; Cell membranes; Dimerization; Plasmas; Proteins; Tissue; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis protein; GEX1 protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; article; cell membrane; flower; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; mutation; phenotype; physiology; plant gametogenesis; prenatal development; protein multimerization; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Membrane; Gametogenesis, Plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germ Cells, Plant; Mutation; Phenotype; Plants, Genetically Modified; Protein Multimerization; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; GEX1 protein, Arabidopsis",,,,"Alandete-Saez, M., Ron, M., McCormick, S., GEX3, expressed in the male gametophyte and in the egg cell of Arabidopsis thaliana, is essential for micropylar pollen tube guidance and plays a role during early embryogenesis (2008) Mol.

For flowering plants, a defining characteristic in the evolution from the 'naked-seed' plants, or gymnosperms, is a reduced female gametophyte, comprising just seven cells of four different types - a microcosm of pattern formation and gamete specification about which only little is known. However, several genes involved in the differentiation, fertilization and post-fertilization functions of the female gametophyte have been identified and, recently, the morphogenic activity of the plant hormone auxin has been found to mediate patterning and egg cell specification. This article reviews recent progress in understanding the pattern formation, maternal effects and evolution of this essential unit of plant reproduction.","Embryo sac; Flowering plant; Gametes; Gametophyte; Reproduction","auxin; apoptosis; Arabidopsis; cell cycle arrest; cell differentiation; cell function; cell migration; cellular distribution; cytoskeleton; embryo pattern formation; endosperm; female gametophyte; fertilization; flowering; gene disruption; gene expression profiling; gene mutation; genetic screening; gymnosperm; habitat; life cycle; meiosis; microcosm; nonhuman; phenotype; plant reproduction; priority journal; review; signal transduction; syncytium; Angiosperms; Body Patterning; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germ Cells, Plant; Indoleacetic Acids; Reproduction; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta; Spermatophyta",,"Indoleacetic Acids",,,,"Alandete-Saez, M., Ron, M., McCormick, S., GEX3, expressed in the male gametophyte and in the egg cell of Arabidopsis thaliana, is essential for micropylar pollen tube guidance and plays a role during early embryogenesis (2008) Mol.

We show that patterning of the Arabidopsis female gametophyte depends on an asymmetric distribution of the hormone auxin during its syncitial development. Furthermore, this auxin gradient is correlated with location-specific auxin biosynthesis, rather than auxin efflux that directs patterning in the diploid sporophytic tissues comprising the rest of the plant. Manipulation of auxin responses or synthesis induces switching of gametic and nongametic cell identities and specialized nonreproductive cells to exhibit attributes presumptively lost during angiosperm evolution. These findings may account for the unique egg cell specification characteristic of angiosperms and the formation of seeds with single diploid embryos while containing endosperm that can have variable numbers of parental haploid genomes.",,"auxin; Arabidopsis protein; carrier protein; hybrid protein; indoleacetic acid derivative; microRNA; oxygenase; PIN1 protein, Arabidopsis; YUC protein, Arabidopsis; asymmetry; gamete; gametophyte; herb; hormone; reproduction; sporophyte; angiosperm; Arabidopsis; article; cell specificity; diploidy; effusion; endosperm; evolution; female gametophyte; genome; haploidy; nonhuman; priority journal; protein synthesis; seed; sporophyte; biological model; cytology; down regulation; flower; gene expression regulation; genetics; germ cell; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mitosis; plant gene; plant seed; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta; Magnoliophyta; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Down-Regulation; Evolution; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Germ Cells; Indoleacetic Acids; Membrane Transport Proteins; MicroRNAs; Mitosis; Models, Biological; Oxygenases; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Seeds; Signal Transduction",,"carrier protein, 80700-39-6; oxygenase, 9037-29-0, 9046-59-7; Arabidopsis Proteins; Indoleacetic Acids; Membrane Transport Proteins; MicroRNAs; Oxygenases, 1.13.-; PIN1 protein, Arabidopsis; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; YUC protein, Arabidopsis, 1.13.14.-",,,,"Frohlich, M.W., Chase, M.W., (2007) Nature, 450, p. 1184; Williams, J.H., Friedman, W.E., (2004) Plant Cell, 16, p. 119. , S; Christensen, C.A., King, E.J., Jordan, J.R., Drews, G.N., (1997) Sex.

Proteins on the surfaces of the sperm, egg, central, and synergid cells might be important for guidance and recognition/fusion of the gametes. Here, we present functional analyses of Arabidopsis GEX3, which encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein that has homologs in other plants. GEX3 is expressed in both the vegetative and sperm cells of the male gametophyte and in the egg cell of the female gametophyte. Transgenic lines in which GEX3 was down-regulated or overexpressed, using the Arabidopsis GEX2 promoter, had reduced seed set. Reciprocal crosses and imaging after pollination with a reporter line showed that, in both cases, the defect causing reduced seed set occurred in the female. In the antisense lines, micropylar pollen tube guidance failed. In the overexpression lines, fertilization of mutant ovules was mostly blocked because pollen tube guidance failed, although, occasionally, non-viable embryos were formed. We conclude that properly regulated expression of GEX3 in the egg cell of Arabidopsis is essential for pollen tube guidance. © The Author 2008.","Antisense; Double fertilization; Female gametophyte; Plasma membrane protein; PQQ domain; Real-time PCR","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Magnoliophyta; Arabidopsis protein; GEX2 protein, Arabidopsis; GEX3 protein, Arabidopsis; messenger RNA; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; cell membrane; chemistry; cytology; down regulation; embryo development; gene expression regulation; genetic selection; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; ovule; phenotype; plant seed; pollen tube; prenatal development; promoter region; protein tertiary structure; transgenic plant; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Membrane; Conserved Sequence; Down-Regulation; Embryonic Development; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Ovule; Phenotype; Plants, Genetically Modified; Pollen Tube; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Structure, Tertiary; RNA, Messenger; Seeds; Selection, Genetic",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; GEX2 protein, Arabidopsis; GEX3 protein, Arabidopsis; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Al-Shehbaz, I.A., O'Kane, S.L., (2002) The Arabidopsis Book; Begun, D.J., Lindfors, H.A., Kern, A.D., Jones, C.D., Evidence for de novo evolution of testis-expressed genes in the Drosophila yakuba/Drosophila erecta clade (2007) Genetics, 176 (2), pp. 1131-1137. , http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/176/2/1131, DOI 10.1534/genetics.106.069245; Beraud-Dufour, S., Balch, W., A journey through the exocytic pathway (2002) Journal of Cell Science, 115 (9), pp. 1779-1780; Boavida, L.C., McCormick, S., Temperature as a determinant factor for increased and reproducible in vitro pollen germination in Arabidopsis thaliana (2007) Plant Journal, 52 (3), pp. 570-582. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03248.x; Chen, Y.-H., Li, H.-J., Shi, D.-Q., Yuan, L., Liu, J., Sreenivasan, R., Baskar, R., Yang, W.C., The central cell plays a critical role in pollen tube guidance in Arabidopsis (2007) Plant Cell, , www.plantcell.org/plantpreview.shtml, 10.1105/tpc.107.053967; Christensen, C.A., Gorsich, S.W., Brown, R.H., Jones, L.G., Brown, J., Shaw, J.M., Drews, G.N., Mitochondrial GFA2 is required for synergid cell death in Arabidopsis (2002) Plant Cell., 14, pp. 2215-2232; Clough, S.J., Bent, A.F., Floral dip: A simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana (1998) Plant J., 16, pp. 735-743; Curtis, M.D., Grossniklaus, U., A gateway cloning vector set for high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta (2003) Plant Physiology, 133 (2), pp. 462-469. , DOI 10.1104/pp.103.027979; Dias, A.P., Braun, E.L., McMullen, M.D., Grotewold, E., Recently duplicated maize R2R3 Myb genes provide evidence for distinct mechanisms of evolutionary divergence after duplication (2003) Plant Physiology, 131 (2), pp. 610-620. , DOI 10.1104/pp.012047; Drews, G.N., Lee, D., Christensen, C.A., Genetic analysis of female gametophyte development and function (1998) Plant Cell, 10 (1), pp. 5-17. , DOI 10.1105/tpc.10.1.5; Engel, M.L., Chaboud, A., Dumas, C., McCormick, S., Sperm cells of Zea mays have a complex complement of mRNAs (2003) Plant Journal, 34 (5), pp. 697-707. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01761.x; Engel, M.L., Holmes-Davis, R., McCormick, S., Green sperm.

RT-PCR analysis has shown that expression of the gene takes place in flowers and developing pods with the tissues accumulating different proportions of splice variants. Spatial analysis of expression, using ARR22::GUS plants as a marker, has revealed that the reporter protein accumulates specifically at the junction between the funiculus and the chalazal tissue. Expression can be up-regulated at this location by wounding the developing seed. A detailed analysis has failed to detect ARR22 expression at any other sites and, to support this assertion, the only evidence for tissue ablation in ARR22::Barnase plants is during seed development, with the consequence that embryo growth is attenuated. Ectopic expression of ARR22, driven by either the CaMV 35S or the pea plastocyanin (PPC) promoters, resulted in the generation of plants exhibiting extremely stunted root and shoot growth. No viable progeny could be isolated from the PPC::ARR22 transgenic lines. An RT-PCR analysis of a recently annotated gene (ARR24-At5g26594), that exhibits 66% amino acid similarity to ARR22, has shown that expression is also predominantly in floral and silique tissues. Examination of ARR24::GUS plants has revealed that the activity of the promoter is primarily restricted to pollen grains indicating that this gene is unlikely to display an overlapping function with ARR22. Analyses of individual KO lines of either ARR22 or ARR24 have failed to identify a mutant phenotype under the growth conditions employed and the double knockout ARR22/ARR24 line is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants. These results are discussed in the light of the proposed role of response regulators in plant growth and development. © 2006 The Author(s).","Arabidopsis; Response regulators; Seed development; Signalling","Amino acids;
