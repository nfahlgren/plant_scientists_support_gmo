The production of bio-based, biodegradable plastics from or in plants can assist in supplanting those manufactured using fossil fuels. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is one such biodegradable polyester that has been evaluated as a possible candidate for relinquishing the use of environmentally harmful plastics. Results: PHB, possessing similar properties to polyesters produced from non-renewable sources, has been previously engineered in sugarcane, thereby creating a high-value co-product in addition to the high biomass yield. This manuscript illustrates the coupling of a Fourier-transform infrared microspectrometer, equipped with a focal plane array (FPA) detector, with multivariate imaging to successfully identify and localize PHB aggregates. Principal component analysis imaging facilitated the mining of the abundant quantity of spectral data acquired using the FPA for distinct PHB vibrational modes. PHB was measured in the chloroplasts of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, acquiescent with previously evaluated plant samples. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the power of IR microspectroscopy to rapidly image plant sections to provide a snapshot of the chemical composition of the cell. While PHB was localized in sugarcane, this method is readily transferable to other value-added co-products in different plants. © 2015 Lupoi et al.","Focal plane array; Infrared imaging; Multivariate imaging; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Sugarcane","Biodegradable polymers; Biological materials; Ecosystems; Elastomers; Focal plane arrays; Focusing; Fossil fuels; Infrared imaging; Microoptics; Plastics; Plastics plants; Principal component analysis; Sugar cane; Biodegradable plastics; Biodegradable polyesters; Chemical compositions; Fourier transform infra reds; Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy; IR micro-spectroscopy; Multivariate imaging; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Thermography (imaging); chemical composition; fossil fuel; FTIR spectroscopy; imaging method; plant product; polymer; principal component analysis; sugar cane",,,,,,"Holmes, L.A., Turner, A., Thompson, R.C., Adsorption of trace metals to plastic resin pellets in the marine environment (2012) Environ Pollut, 160 (1), pp. 42-48. , 10.1016/j.envpol.2011.08.052 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXhtl2qsr%2FI; O'Brine, T., Thompson, R.C., Degradation of plastic carrier bags in the marine environment (2010) Mar Pollut Bull, 60 (12), pp. 2279-2283. , 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.08.005; Derraik, J.G., The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: A review (2002) Mar Pollut Bull, 44 (9), pp. 842-852. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD38XmvVWns78%3D; Steinbüchel, A., Hofrichter, M., (2001) Biopolymers, , Weinheim.

One of the major challenges in engineering C<inf>4</inf> plants for the production of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) is the significantly lower level of polymer produced in the chloroplasts of mesophyll (M) cells compared to bundle sheath (BS) cells, thereby limiting the full PHB yield-potential of the plant. In this study, we provide evidence that the access to substrate for PHB synthesis may limit polymer production in M chloroplasts. Production of PHB in M cells of sugarcane is significantly increased by replacing β-ketothiolase, the first enzyme in the bacterial PHA pathway, with acetoacetyl-CoA synthase. This novel pathway enabled the production of PHB reaching an average of 6.3% of the dry weight of total leaf biomass, with levels ranging from 3.6 to 11.8% of the dry weight (DW) of individual leaves. These yields are more than twice the level reported in PHB-producing sugarcane containing the β-ketothiolase and illustrate the importance of producing polymer in mesophyll plastids to maximize yield. The molecular weight of the polymer produced was greater than 2 × 106 Da. These results are a major step forward in engineering a high biomass C<inf>4</inf> grass for the commercial production of PHB. © 2015 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","PHB; Acetoacetyl-CoA synthase; Biopolymer; NphT7; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Sugarcane; β-ketothiolase","Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,,"Ali, A., Bohmert-Tatarev, K., Chinnapen, H., Patterson, N., Peoples, O.P., Snell, K.D., Somleva, M., Tang, J., (2012) Increasing carbon flow for polyhydroxybutyrate production in biomass crops, pp. 1-65. , Google Patents; Bohmert, K., Balbo, I., Kopka, J., Mittendorf, V., Nawrath, C., Poirier, Y., Tischendorf, G., Willmitzer, L., Transgenic Arabidopsis plants can accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate to up to 4% of their fresh weight (2000) Planta, 211, pp. 841-845; Bohmert, K., Balbo, I., Steinbüchel, A., Tischendorf, G., Willmitzer, L., Constitutive expression of the beta-ketothiolase gene in transgenic plants.

However, high biomass C<inf>4</inf> plants such as maize, switch grass and sugarcane develop adverse phenotypes including stunting, chlorosis and reduced biomass as PHB levels in leaves increase. In this study, we explore limitations to PHB accumulation in sugarcane chloroplasts using a systems biology approach, coupled with a metabolic model of C<inf>4</inf> photosynthesis. Decreased assimilation was evident in high PHB-producing sugarcane plants, which also showed a dramatic decrease in sucrose and starch content of leaves. A subtle decrease in the C/N ratio was found which was not associated with a decrease in total protein content. An increase in amino acids used for nitrogen recapture was also observed. Based on the accumulation of substrates of ATP-dependent reactions, we hypothesized ATP starvation in bundle sheath chloroplasts. This was supported by mRNA differential expression patterns. The disruption in ATP supply in bundle sheath cells appears to be linked to the physical presence of the PHB polymer which may disrupt photosynthesis by scattering photosynthetically active radiation and/or physically disrupting thylakoid membranes. © 2015 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","mRNA; Biopolymer; C<inf>4</inf> metabolic model; Diurnal; Photosynthesis; Polyhydroxybutyrate",,,,,,,,"Mcqualter, R.B.",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,14677644,,,,"English","Plant Biotechnol.

Widespread polyhydroxyalkanoate production in C4 crops would decrease petroleum dependency by producing a renewable supply of biodegradable plastics along with residual biomass that could be converted into biofuels or energy. Increasing yields to commercial levels in biomass crops however remains a challenge. Previously, lower accumulation levels of the short side chain polyhydroxyalkanoate, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), were observed in the chloroplasts of mesophyll (M) cells compared to bundle sheath (BS) cells in transgenic maize (Zea mays), sugarcane (Saccharum sp.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) leading to a significant decrease in the theoretical yield potential. Here we explore various factors which might affect polymer accumulation in mesophyll cells, including targeting of the PHB pathway enzymes to the mesophyll plastid and their access to substrate.Results: The small subunit of Rubisco from pea effectively targeted the PHB biosynthesis enzymes to both M and BS chloroplasts of sugarcane and switchgrass. PHB enzyme activity was retained following targeting to M plastids and was equivalent to that found in the BS plastids. Leaf total fatty acid content was not affected by PHB production. However, when fatty acid synthesis was chemically inhibited, polymer accumulated in M cells.Conclusions: In this study, we provide evidence that access to substrate and neither poor targeting nor insufficient activity of the PHB biosynthetic enzymes may be the limiting factor for polymer production in mesophyll chloroplasts of C4 plants. © 2014 McQualter et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Acetyl-CoA; Biomass; Biopolymer; C4 grasses; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Sugarcane; Switchgrass","Biopolymers; Sugar cane; Acetyl-CoA; C4 grass; Mesophyll cells; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Switchgrass; Biomass; biofuel; glucose; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polyhydroxybutyrate; polymer; starch; sucrose; unclassified drug; Article; biomass; biosynthesis; cellular distribution; chloroplast; controlled study; enzyme activity; fatty acid analysis; fatty acid synthesis; human; immunolocalization; maize; mesophyll; mesophyll cell; Panicum virgatum; plastid; sugarcane",,"glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1",,,,"Byrt, C.S., Grof, C.P., Furbank, R.T., C4 Plants as Biofuel Feedstocks: Optimising Biomass Production and Feedstock Quality from a Lignocellulosic Perspective (2011) J Integr Plant Biol, 53 (2), pp. 120-135; Somerville, C., Youngs, H., Taylor, C., Davis, S.C., Long, S.P., Feedstocks for lignocellulosic biofuels (2010) Science, 329 (5993), pp. 790-792; Chong, B.F., Bonnett, G.D., Glassop, D., O'Shea, M.G., Brumbley, S.M., Growth and metabolism in sugarcane are altered by the creation of a new hexose-phosphate sink (2007) Plant Biotechnol J, 5 (2), pp. 240-253; McQualter, R.B., Chong, B.F., Meyer, K., Van Dyk, D.E., O'Shea, M.G., Walton, N.J., Viitanen, P.V., Brumbley, S.M., Initial evaluation of sugarcane as a production platform for p-hydroxybenzoic acid (2005) Plant Biotechnol J, 3 (1), pp. 29-41; Van Beilen, J.B., Poirier, Y., Plants as factories for bioplastics and other biomaterials (2012) Plant biotechnology and agriculture: prospects for the 21st century, pp. 481-494. , London: Academic press, Altman A, Hasegawa PM; Anderson, A.J., Dawes, E.A., Occurrence, metabolism, metabolic role, and industrial uses of bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (1990) Microbiol Rev, 54 (4), pp. 450-472; Steinbüchel, A., Schlegel, H.G., Physiology and molecular genetics of poly(beta-hydroxy-alkanoic acid) synthesis in Alcaligenes eutrophus (1991) Mol Microbiol, 5 (3), pp. 535-542; Snell, K.D., Peoples, O.P., PHA bioplastic: A value-added coproduct for biomass biorefineries (2009) Biofuel Bioprod Bior, 3 (4), pp. 456-467; Mooney, B.P., The second green revolution?

Widespread polyhydroxyalkanoate production in C4 crops would decrease petroleum dependency by producing a renewable supply of biodegradable plastics along with residual biomass that could be converted into biofuels or energy. Increasing yields to commercial levels in biomass crops however remains a challenge. Previously, lower accumulation levels of the short side chain polyhydroxyalkanoate, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), were observed in the chloroplasts of mesophyll (M) cells compared to bundle sheath (BS) cells in transgenic maize (Zea mays), sugarcane (Saccharum sp.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) leading to a significant decrease in the theoretical yield potential. Here we explore various factors which might affect polymer accumulation in mesophyll cells, including targeting of the PHB pathway enzymes to the mesophyll plastid and their access to substrate. The small subunit of Rubisco from pea effectively targeted the PHB biosynthesis enzymes to both M and BS chloroplasts of sugarcane and switchgrass. PHB enzyme activity was retained following targeting to M plastids and was equivalent to that found in the BS plastids. Leaf total fatty acid content was not affected by PHB production. However, when fatty acid synthesis was chemically inhibited, polymer accumulated in M cells. In this study, we provide evidence that access to substrate and neither poor targeting nor insufficient activity of the PHB biosynthetic enzymes may be the limiting factor for polymer production in mesophyll chloroplasts of C4 plants.",,"hydroxybutyric acid; polyester; article; chemistry; chloroplast; genetics; mesophyll cell; metabolism; Panicum; sugarcane; transgenic plant; Chloroplasts; Hydroxybutyrates; Mesophyll Cells; Panicum; Plants, Genetically Modified; Polyesters; Saccharum",,"hydroxybutyric acid, 1320-61-2, 35054-79-6",,,,,"McQualter, R.B.",,,,,,,,14726750,,,25209261,"English","BMC Biotechnol.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908111957

PHA production in plants may be a way to reduce industrial PHA production costs. We recently demonstrated a promising level of peroxisomal PHA production in the high biomass crop species sugarcane. However, further production strategies are needed to boost PHA accumulation closer to commercial targets. Through exogenous fatty acid feeding of Arabidopsis thaliana plants that contain peroxisome-targeted PhaA, PhaB and PhaC enzymes from Cupriavidus necator, we show here that the availability of substrates derived from the β-oxidation cycle limits peroxisomal polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis. Knockdown of peroxisomal citrate synthase activity using artificial microRNA increased PHB production levels approximately threefold. This work demonstrates that reduction of peroxisomal citrate synthase activity may be a valid metabolic engineering strategy for increasing PHA production in other plant species. © 2014 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Arabidopsis; Citrate synthase; Peroxisome; Plant metabolic engineering; Polyhydroxyalkanoate; β-oxidation","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cupriavidus necator; Arabidopsis protein; citrate synthase; fatty acid; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; Arabidopsis; biosynthesis; enzyme specificity; enzymology; gene silencing; genetics; metabolic engineering; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; peroxisome; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biosynthetic Pathways; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Fatty Acids; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Metabolic Engineering; Oxidation-Reduction; Peroxisomes; Plants, Genetically Modified; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Substrate Specificity",,"citrate synthase, 9027-96-7; Arabidopsis Proteins; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Fatty Acids; Polyhydroxyalkanoates",,,,"Ahumada, I., Cairo, A., Hemmerlin, A., Gonzalez, V., Pateraki, I., Bach, T.J., Rodriguez-Concepcion, M., Boronat, A., Characterisation of the gene family encoding acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase in Arabidopsis (2008) Funct.

Polyhydroxybutyrate is produced commercially by fermentation, but to reduce production costs, efforts are underway to produce it in engineered plants, including sugarcane. However, PHB levels in this high-biomass crop are not yet commercially viable. Chemical ripening with herbicides is a strategy used to enhance sucrose production in sugarcane and was investigated here as a tool to increase PHB production. Class A herbicides inhibit ACCase activity and thus reduce fatty acid biosynthesis, with which PHB production competes directly for substrate. Treatment of PHB-producing transgenic sugarcane plants with 100 μm of the class A herbicide fluazifop resulted in a fourfold increase in PHB content in the leaves, which peaked ten days post-treatment. The minimum effective concentration of herbicide required to maximize PHB production was 30 μm for fluazifop and 70 μm for butroxydim when applied to saturation. Application of a range of class A herbicides from the DIM and FOP groups consistently resulted in increased PHB yields, particularly in immature leaf tissue. Butroxydim or fluazifop treatment of mature transgenic sugarcane grown under glasshouse conditions increased the total leaf biomass yield of PHB by 50%-60%. Application of an ACCase inhibitor in the form of a class A herbicide to mature sugarcane plants prior to harvest is a promising strategy for improving overall PHB yield. Further testing is required on field-grown transgenic sugarcane to more precisely determine the effectiveness of this strategy. © 2013 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Biopolymer; Chemical ripener; Herbicide; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Sugarcane","Bacteria (microorganisms); acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; biopolymer; herbicide; hydroxybutyric acid; polyhydroxybutyrate; article; biomass; chemical ripener; drug antagonism; drug effect; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetic engineering; genetics; metabolism; plant leaf; sugarcane; time; transgenic plant; biopolymer; chemical ripener; herbicide; polyhydroxybutyrate; sugarcane; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Biomass; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genetic Engineering; Herbicides; Hydroxybutyrates; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Saccharum; Time Factors",,"acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, 9023-93-2; hydroxybutyric acid, 1320-61-2, 35054-79-6",,,,"Alban, C., Baldet, P., Douce, R., Localization and characterization of 2 structurally different forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in young pea leaves, of which one is sensitive to aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides (1994) Biochem.

Plant-based production has the potential to make this biorenewable plastic highly competitive with petrochemical-based plastics. We previously reported that transgenic sugarcane produced PHB at levels as high as 1.8% leaf dry weight without penalty to biomass accumulation, suggesting scope for improving PHB production in this species. In this study, we used different plant and viral promoters, in combination with multigene or single-gene constructs to increase PHB levels. Promoters tested included the maize and rice polyubiquitin promoters, the maize chlorophyll A/B-binding protein promoter and a Cavendish banana streak badnavirus promoter. At the seedling stage, the highest levels of polymer were produced in sugarcane plants when the Cavendish banana streak badnavirus promoter was used. However, in all cases, this promoter underwent silencing as the plants matured. The rice Ubi promoter enabled the production of PHB at levels similar to the maize Ubi promoter. The maize chlorophyll A/B-binding protein promoter enabled the production of PHB to levels as high as 4.8% of the leaf dry weight, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than previously reported levels in sugarcane. This is the first time that this promoter has been tested in sugarcane. The highest PHB-producing lines showed phenotypic differences to the wild-type parent, including reduced biomass and slight chlorosis. © 2012 The Authors.

The substrates for these enzymes are chorismate (a shikimate pathway intermediate that is synthesized in plastids) and 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA (a cytosolic phenylpropanoid intermediate). Although both proteins have previously been shown to elevate p-hydroxybenzoic acid levels in plants, they have never been evaluated concurrently in the same laboratory. Nor are there any reports on their efficacy in stem tissue. After surveying two large populations of transgenic plants, it was concluded that the hydratase/lyase is the superior catalyst for leaf and stem tissue, and further studies focused on this pathway. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was quantitatively converted to glucose conjugates by endogenous uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucosyltransferases and presumably stored in the vacuole. The largest amounts detected in leaf and stem tissue were 7.3% and 1.5% dry weight (DW), respectively, yet there were no discernible phenotypic abnormalities. However, as a result of diverting carbon away from the phenylpropanoid pathway, there was a severe reduction in leaf chlorogenic acid, subtle changes in lignin composition, as revealed by phloroglucinol staining, and an apparent compensatory up-regulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. Although product accumulation in the leaves at the highest level of gene expression obtained in the present study was clearly substrate-limited, additional experiments are necessary before this conclusion can be extended to the stalk. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bioplastics; Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase; Metabolic engineering; P-hydroxybenzoic acid; Sugarcane","Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas fluorescens; Saccharum hybrid cultivar; Saccharum sp.",,,,,,"Alexander, A.G., (1973) Sugarcane Physiology, , New York: Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co; Barker, J.L., Frost, J.W., Microbial synthesis of p-hydroxybenzoic acid from glucose (2001) Biotechnol.

Sixty-four transgenic lines were tested in glasshouse trials by caging the plants with viruliferous Perkinsiella saccharicida planthoppers. After 2 weeks, the planthoppers were removed and the plants monitored for symptoms. One transgenic line showed significantly enhanced resistance to Fiji disease compared with the Q124 parent and other lines showed varying levels of resistance. The molecular phenotypes of the transgenic plants at both the DNA and RNA levels were not entirely consistent with a resistance mechanism based on post-transcriptional gene silencing but were consistent with reports from other sugarcane-viras resistance systems. This is the first report of transgenic sugarcane containing an FDV-derived synthetic resistance gene showing resistance to FDV, although the mechanism of resistance has not yet been elucidated.","Fijivirus; Transgenic resistance","disease resistance; planthopper; sugar cane; transgenic plant; viral disease; Archaeorrhyncha; Arundinaria; Delphacidae; Fiji disease virus; Fijivirus; Hemiptera; Perkinsiella saccharicida; Saccharum; Saccharum hybrid cultivar; Zea mays",,,,,,"Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , John Wiley and Sons: New York; Baulcombe, D., Viruses and gene silencing in plants (1999) Archives of Virology, 15, pp. 189-201; Bower, R., Elliott, A.R., Potier, B.A.M., Birch, R.G., High-efficiency, microprojectile-mediated cotransformation of sugarcane using visible or selectable markers (1996) Molecular Breeding, 2, pp. 239-249; Chaogang, S., Jianhua, W., Guoying, Z., Gang, S., Baozhen, P., Ectopic expression of the spike protein of Rice Ragged Stunt Oryzavirus in transgenic rice plants inhibits transmission of the virus to insects (2003) Molecular Breeding, 11, pp. 295-301. , doi:10.1023/A:1023418416094; Christensen, A.H., Quail, P.H., Ubiquitin promoter-based vectors for high-level expression of selectable and/or screenable marker genes in monocotyledonous plants (1996) Transgenic Research, 5, pp. 213-218; Conover, W.J., (1980) Practical Nonparametric Statistics, , John Wiley and Sons: New York; Daniels, J., Husain, A.A., Hutchinson, P.B., Wismer, C.A., An insectary method for testing sugar cane varieties for resistance to Fiji disease (1969) Proceedings of the International Society of Sugar Cane Technologists, 13, pp. 1100-1106; Francki, R.I., Grivell, C.J., Occurrence of similar particles in Fiji disease virus-infected sugar cane and insect vector cells (1972) Virology, 48, pp. 305-307; Franks, T., Birch, R.G., Gene transfer into intact sugarcane cells using microprojectile bombardment (1991) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 18, pp. 471-480; Goodwin, J., Chapman, K., Swaney, S., Parks, T.D., Wernsman, E.A., Dougherty, W.G., Genetic and biochemical dissection of transgenic RNA-mediated virus resistance (1996) Plant Cell, 8, pp. 95-105. , doi:10.1105/TPC.8.1.95; Husain, A.A., Hutchinson, P.B., Further experience with the insectary method of testing sugar cane varieties for resistance to Fiji disease (1971) Proceedings of the International Society of Sugar Cane Technologists, 14, pp. 1001-1006; Hutchinson, P., Francki, R.I., Sugarcane Fiji disease virus (1973) Descriptions of Plant Viruses, 119, pp. 1-3; Ingelbrecht, I.L., Irvine, J.E., Mirkov, T.E., Posttranscriptional gene silencing in transgenic sugarcane.

The terminal sequences of S1 and S3 were 5′ AAGUUUUU ...... CAGCUAGCGUC 3′ and 5′ AAGUUUUU ...... CAGCAGAUGUC 3′, respectively, and located immediately adjacent to these sequences were 12 bp imperfect inverted repeats. The predicted translation product of FDV S1 showed highest similarity to Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) S1 and is thought to encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The predicted translation product of FDV S3 was found to be most similar to RBSDV S4 which is thought to encode the 'B-spike' protein. The FDV sequence contained an ATP/GTP binding motif and a leucine zipper motif, but these motifs were not found in the RBSDV sequence. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of the RdRp of FDV S1 and other reoviruses revealed that the fijiviruses form a cluster close to the oryzaviruses. The RdRp sequences were grouped into genera that were consistent with the current reovirus classification scheme that is based on physico-chemical and biological properties.","Fiji disease virus; Fijivirus; Phylogenetic analysis; RdRp; Reovirus","adenosine triphosphate; gene product; guanosine triphosphate; leucine zipper protein; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus protein; amino acid sequence; article; Fiji disease fijivirus; gene function; gene location; gene sequence; genome analysis; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide repeat; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein motif; Reovirus; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rice black streaked dwarf virus; RNA extraction; RNA translation; sequence analysis; sequence homology; transgene; virus classification; virus genome; Amino Acid Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Genome, Viral; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases; Reoviridae; RNA Replicase; RNA, Double-Stranded; Saccharum; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Fiji disease virus; Fijivirus; Orthoreovirus; Prokaryota; Reovirus sp.; Rice black streaked dwarf virus; RNA viruses","GENBANK: AF284502, AF359556, AY029520, D49693, L20445, L20446, L20447, L20508, M31058, NP_112029, NP_149135, NP_149147, P35942, Q02119, Q98631, X12819","adenosine triphosphate, 15237-44-2, 56-65-5, 987-65-5; guanosine triphosphate, 86-01-1; RNA directed RNA polymerase, 9026-28-2; DNA, Complementary; RNA Replicase, EC 2.7.7.48; RNA, Double-Stranded",,,,"Hughes, C., Robinson, P., (1961) Sugar Cane Diseases of the World, 1, pp. 389-405. , Martin J.P., Abbott E.V., and Hughes C.G.

Pathogen-derived resistance using the viral coat protein (CP) gene has been successfully demonstrated in other host/virus combinations and is being evaluated in sugarcane. Sugarcane plants were cotransformed with the CP gene of sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) and the neomycin phosphotransferasell (nptll) (selectable marker) gene by microprojectile bombardment. These genes were constructed with either the Emu (an artificial promoter) or the ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter. Over 80 transgenic lines were assessed for nptll activity by dot-blot and ELISA. There was considerable variability between lines in npt expression, with the most active Ubi line producing npt enzyme to a level equivalent to 0.03% of total soluble protein. Initial results show no correlation between the number of copies of the transgene and the level of npt expression. Plants containing the CP transgene have been selected, propagated and challenged with SCMV in glasshouse trials. Ten lines were resistant to challenge inoculation with the virus and these lines are being further characterised.","Mosaic; Potyvirus; Resistance; Saccharum L.; SCMV; Sugarcane; Transgenes",,,,,,"Sugar Research and Development Corporation","Beachy, R.N., Mechanisms and applications of pathogen - Derived resistance on transgenic plants (1997) Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 8, pp. 215-220; Bower, R., Elliot, A.R., Potier, A.M., Birch, R.G., High efficiency, microprojectile-mediated cotransformation of sugarcane, using visible or selectable markers (1996) Molecular Breeding, 2, pp. 239-249; Franks, T., Birch, R.G., Gene transfer into intact Sugarcane cells using microprojectile bombardment (1991) Aust.
