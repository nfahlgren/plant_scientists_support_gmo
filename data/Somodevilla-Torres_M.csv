Here we report that this G2 phase pool regulates the timing of progression into mitosis. Knock down of cyclin A by siRNA or addition of a specific cdk2 small molecule inhibitor delayed entry into mitosis by delaying cells in G2 phase. The G 2 phase-delayed cells contained elevated levels of inactive cyclin B/cdk1. However, increased microtubule nucleation at the centrosomes was observed, and the centrosomes stained for markers of cyclin B/cdk1 activity. Both microtubule nucleation at the centrosomes and the phosphoprotein markers were lost with short-term treatment of the cdk1/2 inhibitor roscovitine but not the Mek1/2 inhibitor U0126. Cyclin A/cdk2 localized at the centrosomes in late G2 phase after separation of the centrosomes but before the start of prophase. Thus G2 phase cyclin A/cdk2 controls the timing of entry into mitosis by controlling the subsequent activation of cyclin B/cdk1, but also has an unexpected role in coordinating the activation of cyclin B/cdk1 at the centrosome and in the nucleus. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Centrosome;

It has been shown to suppress the delayed-type hypersensitivity response in mice as well as acute and chronic forms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats and mice, respectively. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that EPF binds to a population of lymphocytes and we hypothesized that it mediates its suppressive effects by binding to CD4+ T cells. In the present study, we isolated monocytes and subpopulations of lymphocytes and labelled them with fluoresceinated EPF in order to determine which populations bind EPF. We demonstrated that EPF binds specifically to CD4+, CD8+, CD14+ (monocytes) and CD56+ NK cells but not to CD19+ B cells. The identity of the molecule(s) on the cell surface that is targeted by EPF is unknown, but as EPF is an extracellular homologue of the intracellular protein chaperonin 10 (Cpn10), we examined the possibility that the EPF receptor is a membrane-associated form of chaperonin 60 (Cpn60), the functional associate of Cpn10 within the cell. The EPF target molecule on lymphocytes was visualized by chemical cross-linking of exogenous iodinated Cpn10 to cells and probed with anti-Cpn60. The effect of anti-Cpn60 on activity in the EPF bioassay, the rosette inhibition test, was also examined. In both instances, no specific interaction of this antibody and the putative receptor was observed. It was concluded that the cell surface molecule targeted by EPF is unlikely to be a homologue of Cpn60.","Chaperonin 10; Early pregnancy factor; Early pregnancy factor receptor; Lymphocyte; Monocyte","CD14 antigen; CD19 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD8 antigen; chaperonin; early pregnancy factor; early pregnancy factor receptor; growth factor receptor; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; B lymphocyte; binding affinity; controlled study; cross linking; female; human; human cell; immunocompetent cell; lymphocyte subpopulation; male; monocyte; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; phenotype; protein binding; protein function; spleen cell; Animals; Antigens, CD14; Antigens, CD56; Antigens, CD8; Chaperonin 60; Female; Humans; Immunocompetence; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lymphocytes; Male; Mice; Monocytes; Peptides; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Proteins; Rats; Rosette Formation; Suppressor Factors, Immunologic; Animalia",,"Antigens, CD14; Antigens, CD56; Antigens, CD8; Chaperonin 60; Immunosuppressive Agents; Peptides; Pregnancy Proteins; Suppressor Factors, Immunologic; early pregnancy factor",,,,"Morton, H., Hegh, V., Clunie, G.J.A., Immunosuppression detected in pregnant mice by rosette inhibition test (1974) Nature, 249, pp. 459-460; Morton, H., Hegh, V., Clunie, G.J.A., Studies of the rosette inhibition test in pregnant mice: Evidence of immunosuppression?

The present study was undertaken to develop a simple high-yielding procedure for preparation of material for structure/function studies, which could be scaled up for therapeutic application. Human EPF was expressed in Sf9 insect cells by baculovirus infection and in Escherichia coli using a heat inducible vector. A modified molecule with an additional N-terminal alanine was also expressed in E. coli. The soluble protein was purified from cell lysates via anion exchange (negative-binding mode), cation exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, yielding ∼42 and 36 mg EPF from 300 ml bacterial and 1 L Sf9 cultures, respectively. The preparations were highly purified (≥99% purity on SDS-PAGE for the bacterial products and ≥97% for that of insect cells) and had the expected mass and heptameric structure under native conditions, as determined by mass spectrometry and gel permeation chromatography, respectively. All recombinant preparations exhibited activity in the EPF bioassay, the rosette inhibition test, with similar potency both to each other and to the native molecule. In two in vivo assays of immunosuppressive activity, the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the insect cell and modified bacterial products, both with N-terminal additions (acetylation or amino acid), exhibited similar levels of suppressive activity, but the bacterial product with no N-terminal modification had no effect in either assay. Studies by others have shown that N-terminal addition is not necessary for Cpn10 activity. By defining techniques for facile production of molecules with and without immunosuppressive properties, the present studies make it possible to explore mechanisms underlying the distinction between EPF and Cpn10 activity. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Methods and Results: The method, sequential nucleic acid amplification and capture (SNAAC), combines amplification with hybridization of the product to a surface/matrix-bound oligonucleotide probe. After amplification of the target sequence using species-specific primers, one of which contains a detection tag such as fluorescein or biotin, a denaturation and hybridization cycle is performed. This allows capture by an oligonucleotide that is covalently bound to the surface of a microtiter tray well or other support. After washing to remove unincorporated solution-phase oligonucleotide bearing the detection tag, the level of captured product is determined through a colorimetric reaction using an automated plate reader. We show the value and utility of the SNAAC detection method using cloned sequences of the important human respiratory pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae. Conclusions: SNAAC is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for the detection of low levels of infectious agents that is readily adaptable to current clinical laboratory equipment, thus avoiding the need to develop or purchase new instrumentation.","Chlamydia pneumoniae; PCR; SNAAC","oligonucleotide; article; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; colorimetry; covalent bond; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human cell; hybridization; nucleic acid analysis; oligonucleotide probe; ornithosis; sensitivity and specificity; species difference; Biotin; Chemistry, Clinical; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Electrophoresis, Agar Gel; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fluorescein; GroEL Protein; Humans; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Nucleic Acids; Plasmids; Polymerase Chain Reaction",,"Biotin, 58-85-5; Fluorescein, 2321-07-5; GroEL Protein; Nucleic Acids",,,,"Black, C.M., Current methods of laboratory diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections (1997) Clin Microbiol Rev, 10, pp. 160-184; Boman, J., Gaydos, C., Quinn, T., Molecular diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection (1999) J Clin Microbiol, 12, pp. 3791-3799; Cook, P.J., Davies, P., Tunnicliffe, W., Ayres, J.G., Honeybourne, D., Wise, R., Chlamydia pneumoniae and asthma (1998) Thorax, 53, pp. 254-259; Saikku, P., Leinonen, M., Mattila, K., Serological evidence of an association of a novel Chlamydia, TWAR, with chronic coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction (1988) Lancet, 2, pp. 983-986; Danesh, J., Collins, R., Peto, R., Chronic infections and coronary heart disease: Is there any link?

During pregnancy, it appears in maternal serum within 6-24 h of fertilization, is present for at least the first two-thirds of pregnancy in all species studied and is essential for embryonic survival. It is a homologue of chaperonin 10, a heat shock protein, but, unlike other members of this family, EPF has an extracellular role. As it has the ability to modulate CD4+ T cell-dependent immune responses, its role in treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was investigated. EAE is a CD4+ T cell-mediated disease, the best available animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Two models of EAE were investigated, acute EAE induced in Lewis rats by inoculation with myelin basic protein (MBP-EAE) and chronic relapsing EAE induced in SJL/J mice by inoculation with myelin proteolipid protein peptide (residues 139-151) (PLP-EAE). EPF, delivered intraperitoneally or orally to rats or intraperitoneally to mice, suppressed clinical signs of disease. Mice with PLP-EAE were also treated with interferon-β, with and without EPF. Both EPF and IFN-β suppressed clinical signs of EAE and, when administered together, gave greater suppression than when given separately. These findings suggest that EPF may be a potential candidate for use in treatment of MS and may be of use in combined therapy with IFN-β.

In order to carry out more extensive studies on the in vivo characteristics of EPF, a recombinant form of the molecule has been prepared. Recombinant human EPF (rEPF) was expressed in Escherichia coli using the plasmid pGEX-2T expression system. Potency of rEPF in vitro in the rosette inhibition test, the bioassay for EPF, was equivalent to that of native EPF (nEPF), purified from human platelets, and synthetic EPF (sEPF). However, the half-life of activity (50% decrease in the log value) in serum, following i.p. injection, was significantly decreased (3.2 h, compared with nEPF 6.2 days, sEPF 5.8 days). This was thought to be due to modification of the N-terminus of the recombinant molecule inhibiting binding to serum carrier proteins. Because EPF can modify Th1 responses, the ability of the recombinant molecule to suppress allogeneic graft rejection was investigated. Following skin grafts from Lewis rats to DA rats and vice versa, rEPF was delivered locally at the graft site and the effect on survival time of the allografts noted. Results demonstrated that rEPF treatment significantly prolonged skin graft survival time by as much as 55% in stringent models of transplantation across major histocompatibility barriers.","Chaperonin 10; Early pregnancy factor; Local immunosuppression; Recombinant protein; Rosette inhibition test; Skin graft","carrier protein; chaperonin; early pregnancy factor; plasmid vector; recombinant protein; allograft; amino terminal sequence; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bioassay; controlled study; drug protein binding; Escherichia coli; graft rejection; graft survival; immunosuppressive treatment; male; nonhuman; plasma half life; rat; rosette test; skin graft; skin transplantation; survival time; thrombocyte; Animals; Escherichia coli; Graft Survival; Immunosuppressive Agents; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Peptides; Pregnancy Proteins; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew; Recombinant Proteins; Rosette Formation; Skin Transplantation; Suppressor Factors, Immunologic; Time Factors; Transplantation Tolerance; Transplantation, Homologous; Animalia; Escherichia coli",,"early pregnancy factor; Immunosuppressive Agents; Peptides; Pregnancy Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Suppressor Factors, Immunologic",,,,"Morton, H., Hegh, V., Clunie, G.J.A., Studies of the rosette inhibition test in pregnant mice; evidence of immunosuppression?
