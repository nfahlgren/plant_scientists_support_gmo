The flow of essential organic nutrients among the plant organ systems is mediated by its complex vascular system, and is driven by a series of transport steps including export from sites of primary assimilation, transport into and out of the phloem and xylem, and transport into the various import-dependent organs. Manipulating C and N partitioning to enhance yield of harvested organs is evident in the earliest crop domestication events and continues to be a goal for modern plant biology. Research on the biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, and physiology of C and N partitioning has now matured to an extent that strategic manipulation of these transport systems through biotechnology are being attempted to improve movement from source to sink tissues in general, but also to target partitioning to specific organs. These nascent efforts are demonstrating the potential of applied biomass targeting but are also identifying interactions between essential nutrients that require further basic research. In this review, we summarize the key transport steps involved in C and N partitioning, and discuss various transgenic approaches for directly manipulating key C and N transporters involved. In addition, we propose several experiments that could enhance biomass accumulation in targeted organs while simultaneously testing current partitioning models. © 2015 Yadav, Ayre and Bush.","Amino acid transport; Assimilate partitioning; Crop yield; Nutritional value; Sugar transport in plants",,,,,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Bush, D.R., Carbohydrate export from the leaf: A highly regulated process and target to enhance photosynthesis and productivity (2011) Plant Physiol, 155, pp. 64-69; Ayre, B.G., Membrane-transport systems for sucrose in relation to whole-plant carbon partitioning (2011) Mol.

The potential of regulating the translocation of photoassimilates from source to sink tissues represents an opportunity to increase crop yield. Pyrophosphate homeostasis is crucial for normal phloem function in apoplasmic loaders. The involvement of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) type I proton-pumping pyrophosphatase (AVP1) in phloem loading was analyzed at genetic, histochemical, and physiological levels. A transcriptional AVP1 promoter:: GUS fusion revealed phloem activity in source leaves. Ubiquitous AVP1 overexpression (35S::AVP1 cassette) enhanced shoot biomass, photoassimilate production and transport, rhizosphere acidification, and expression of sugar-induced root ion transporter genes (POTASSIUM TRANSPORTER2 [KUP2], NITRATE TRANSPORTER2.1 [NRT2.1], NRT2.4, and PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1.4 [PHT1.4]). Phloem-specific AVP1 overexpression (Commelina Yellow Mottle Virus promoter [pCOYMV]::AVP1) elicited similar phenotypes. By contrast, phloem-specific AVP1 knockdown (pCoYMV::<inf>RNAi</inf>AVP1) resulted in stunted seedlings in sucrose-deprived medium. We also present a promoter mutant avp1-2 (SALK046492) with a 70% reduction of expression that did not show severe growth impairment. Interestingly, AVP1 protein in this mutant is prominent in the phloem.Moreover, expression of an Escherichia colisoluble pyrophosphatase in the phloem (pCoYMV::pyrophosphatase) of avp1-2 plants resulted in severe dwarf phenotype and abnormal leaf morphology. We conclude that the Proton-Pumping Pyrophosphatase AVP1 localized at the plasma membrane of the sieve element-companion cell complexes functions as a synthase, and that this activity is critical for the maintenance of pyrophosphate homeostasis required for phloem function. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Bast fibers are expanding into new markets of non-woven fabrics and composite materials, and a comparative assessment of surface reactive groups and mechanical properties after different retting procedures is of value. Here, bast fiber of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L., Malvaceae) were prepared by (1) alkali retting with 2% NaOH and (2) enzymatic retting with pectinase, and compared with commercially-available fiber retted by the natural microbe population in ocean water. Fiber structure was analyzed by fluorescence and electron microscopy; fiber chemistry was assessed by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and by carbohydrate analysis; and mechanical properties were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Collectively, these show that enzymatic and microbial retting preserve the natural fiber structure and result in superior mechanical properties compared with alkali retting, which disrupts structure and degrades quality. The impacts of the retting procedure on fiber chemistry, morphology and mechanical properties are discussed. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","cell wall; Fourier transform Raman; kenaf; mechanical properties; natural fiber; retting; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Bast fibers; Chemical analysis; Dynamics; Fibers; Hemp; Kenaf fibers; Mechanical properties; Natural fibers; Photoelectrons; Photons; Surface chemistry; Weaving; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbohydrate analysis; Cell walls; Comparative assessment; Fourier transform Raman; Hibiscus cannabinus; kenaf; Morphology and mechanical properties; retting; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Anatomy; Bark; Carbohydrates; Mechanical Properties; Nonwovens; Phloem; Retting; Textiles",,,,,,"Grove CS, Casey RS and Vodonik JL.

Plants have a chemical and physical architecture reflective of their age. The region near the apex is more flexible than that near the base. In this paper we investigate the impact of increasing age of plant fiber on the corresponding composite. Bast fibers stems of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus, L.), a warm season tropical herbaceous annual plant extracted corresponding to different age, were dispersed into Poly-l-lactide (PLLA) matrix by melt blending followed by compression molding. The resulting bio-based hybrid composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were conducted. DSC and XRD indicated that the kenaf was effective in promoting crystallization. TGA indicated that the thermal stability of composites is reduced compared with PLLA, but the older fiber sample based on 120-150 cm from the plant apex improved thermal stability compared with the rest. SEM and OM inferred good fiber dispersion while dynamic mechanical tests revealed increased modulus. © 2013 Society of Plastics Engineers.",,"Blending; Differential scanning calorimetry; Hemp; Infrared spectroscopy; Mechanical properties; Natural fibers; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Composite properties; Dynamic mechanical test; Fiber dispersion; Hibiscus cannabinus; High standards; Hybrid composites; Physical architecture; Poly-L-lactide; Plants (botany); Calorimetry; Gravimetry; Hemp; Infrared Spectroscopy; Mechanical Properties; Mixing; Natural Fibers; Plants; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Thermal Stability; X Ray Diffraction",,,,,,"Mohanty, A.K., Misra, M., Drzal, L.T., (2005) Natural Fibers, Biopolymers and Biocomposites, p. 37. , In, Taylor & Francis; Kalaycioglu, H., Nemli, G., (2006) Ind.

In all streptophytes analyzed, Suc transporter genes (SUTs or SUCs) form small families, with different subgroups evolving distinct functions. To gain insight into their capacity for moving Suc in planta, representative members of each clade were first expressed specifically in companion cells of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and tested for their ability to rescue the phloem-loading defect caused by the Suc transporter mutation, Atsuc2-4. Sequence similarity was a poor indicator of ability: Several genes with high homology to AtSUC2, some of which have phloem-loading functions in other eudicot species, did not rescue the Atsuc2-4 mutation, whereas a more distantly related gene, ZmSUT1 from the monocot Zea mays, did restore phloem loading. Transporter complementary DNAs were also expressed in the companion cells of wild-type Arabidopsis, with the aim of increasing productivity by enhancing Suc transport to growing sink organs and reducing Suc-mediated feedback inhibition on photosynthesis. Although enhanced Suc loading and long-distance transport was achieved, growth was diminished. This growth inhibition was accompanied by increased expression of phosphate (P) starvation-induced genes and was reversed by providing a higher supply of external P. These experiments suggest that efforts to increase productivity by enhancing sugar transport may disrupt the carbon-to-P homeostasis. A model for how the plant perceives and responds to changes in the carbon-to-P balance is presented. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Two fiber lengths, 5 and 10 mm and a hybrid 1:1 fiber mixture were utilized. From DMA results, the NaOH retted fibers showed synergistic benefits of using hybrid fiber lengths on modulus. The pectinase retted samples did not show synergistic benefits of fiber lengths but composites of the same fiber length retted by pectinase outperformed the corresponding composites with NaOH retted fibers. The fiber retting method also affected recrystallization of the biopolymer. Pectinase retting showed a higher recrystallization temperature than NaOH retting. Transcrystallization resulting from fiber presence was analyzed using polarized optical microscopy.

Proton-coupled symport of sugars from the apoplasm into the phloem symplasm is the best studied phloem-loading mechanism. As an alternative, numerous species use a polymer trapping mechanism to load through symplasm: sucrose enters the phloem through specialized plasmodesmata and is converted to raffinose-family oligosaccharides (RFOs) which accumulate because of their larger size. In this study, metabolic engineering was used to generate RFOs at the inception of the translocation stream of Arabidopsis thaliana, which loads from the apoplasm and transports predominantly sucrose, and the fate of the sugars throughout the plant determined. Three genes, GALACTINOL SYNTHASE, RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE and STACHYOSE SYNTHASE, were expressed from promoters specific to the companion cells of minor veins. Two transgenic lines homozygous for all three genes (GRS63 and GRS47) were selected for further analysis. Three-week-old plants of both lines had RFO levels approaching 50% of total soluble sugar. RFOs were also identified in exudates from excised leaves of transgenic plants whereas levels were negligible in exudates from wild type (WT) leaves. Differences in starch accumulation between WT and GRS63 and GRS47 lines were not observed. Similarly, there were no differences in vegetative growth between WT and engineered plants, but the latter flowered slightly earlier. Finally, since the sugar composition of the translocation stream appeared altered, we tested for an impact on green peach aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer) feeding. When given a choice between WT and transgenic plants, green peach aphids preferred settling on the WT plants. Furthermore, green peach aphid fecundity was lower on the transgenic plants compared to the WT plants. When added to an artificial diet, RFOs did not have a negative effect on aphid fecundity, suggesting that although aphid resistance in the transgenic plants is enhanced, it is not due to direct toxicity of RFO toward the insect. © 2013 Cao, Lahiri, Singh, Louis, Shah and Ayre.","Green peach aphid; Metabolic engineering; Phloem transport; Raffinose family oligosaccharides; Sugar transport",,,,,,"0922546, NSF, National Science Foundation; IOS0344088, NSF, National Science Foundation","Ayre, B.G., Membrane-transport systems for sucrose in relation to whole-plant carbon partitioning (2011) Mol.

Microbial communities were identified by semiconductor sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from DNA harvested from plant-surface associated samples and analyzed using an Ion Torrent PGM. The communities were sampled after 96 h from each of three different conditions, including amendments with pond water, sterilized pond water, or with a mixture of pectinolytic bacterial isolates. Additionally, plants from two different sources and having different pretreatment conditions were compared. We report that the best retting communities are dominated by members of the order Clostridiales. These bacteria appear to be naturally associated with the plant material, although slight variations between source materials were found. Additionally, heavy inoculations of pectinolytic bacteria established themselves and in addition their presence facilitated the rapid dominance of the original plant-associated Clostridiales. These data suggest that members of the order Clostridiales dominate the community and are most closely associated with efficient and effective retting. The results further suggest that establishment of the community structure is first driven by the switch to anaerobic conditions, and subsequently by possible competition for nitrogen. These findings reveal important bacterial groups involved in fiber retting, and suggest mechanisms for the manipulation of the community and retting efficiency by modifying nutrient availability. © 2013 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.","Bioproducts; Microbial diversity; Retting; Semiconductor; Sequencing","lake water; nitrogen; RNA 16S; amplicon; article; bacterial retting community; bacterium isolate; Clostridiales; community structure; controlled study; inoculation; kenaf; microbial community; microbial diversity; next generation semiconductor sequencing; nonhuman; nutrient availability; plant fiber; scale up; sequence analysis; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Fresh Water; Gene Library; Hibiscus; Pectins; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Semiconductors; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Wettability; Bacteria (microorganisms); Clostridiales; Hibiscus cannabinus",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Pectins; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; pectin, 9000-69-5",,,,"Ahmad, M., Studies on jute retting bacteria (1963) J Appl Microbiol, 26, pp. 117-126. , 10.1111/j.1365-2672.1963.tb04761.x; Akin, D.E., Foulk, J.A., Dodd, R.B., McAlister III, D.D., Enzyme-retting of flax and characterization of processed fibers (2001) J Biotechnol, 89 (2-3), pp. 193-203. , 11500213 10.1016/S0168-1656(01)00298-X 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3MXlslChtLc%3D; Ali, M., Aerobic bacteria involved in the retting of jute (1958) Appl Microbiol, 6, pp. 87-89. , 16349583 1:STN:280:DC%2BD28%2Fmt1OntA%3D%3D; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J Mol Biol, 215, pp. 403-410. , 2231712 1:CAS:528:DyaK3MXitVGmsA%3D%3D; Anandjiwala, R.D., Blouw, S., Composites from bast fibers: Prospects and potential in the changing market environment (2007) J Nat Fibers, 4 (2), pp. 91-109. , 10.1300/J395v04n02-07; Baker, G.C., Smith, J.J., Cowan, D.A., Review and re-analysis of domain-specific 16S primers (2003) J Microbiol Methods, 55, pp. 541-555. , 14607398 10.1016/j.mimet.2003.08.009 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXos1KmsLw%3D; Banik, S., Basak, M.K., Sil, S.C., Effect of inoculation of pectinolytic mixed bacterial culture on improvement of ribbon retting of jute and kenaf (2007) J Nat Fibers, 4 (2), pp. 33-50. , 10.1300/J395v04n02-03; Beg, Q.K., Bhushan, B., Hoondal, G.S., Production and characterization of thermostable xylanase and pectinase from Streptomyces sp. qg-11-3 (2000) J Ind Microbiol Biotechl, 24 (2000), pp. 396-402. , 10.1038/sj.jim.7000010 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXmtFyhsbs%3D; Bergmann, G.T., Bales, S.T., Eilers, K.G., Lauber, C.L., Caporaso, J.G., Walters, W.A., Knight, R., Fierer, N., The under-recognized dominance of Verrucomicrobia in soil bacterial communities (2011) Soil Biol Biochem, 43 (7), pp. 1450-1455. , 22267877 10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.03.012 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXmtFCrs74%3D; Bertani, G., The mode of phage liberation by lysogenic Escherichia coli (1951) J Bact, 62 (3), pp. 293-300. , 14888646 1:STN:280:DyaG38%2FhvVOmtA%3D%3D; Bin, Z., Guo-Cheng, D., Wei, S., Jian, Z., Jian, C., Expression of Bacillus subtilis pectate lyase gene in Pichia pastoris (2008) Biochem Eng J, 40, pp. 92-98. , 10.1016/j.bej.2007.11.018; Blakenberg, D., Gordon, A., Von Kuster, G., Coraor, N., Taylor, J., Nekrutenko, A., Team, G., Manipulation of FASTQ data with galaxy (2010) Bioinforma, 26 (14), pp. 1783-1785. , 10.1093/bioinformatics/btq281; Boland, W.E., Henriksen, E.D., Doran-Peterson, J., Characterization of two pectate lyases from Paenibacillus amylolyticus strain 27C64 with activity on highly methylated pectin (2010) Appl Environ Microbiol, 76 (17), pp. 6006-6009. , 20622125 10.1128/AEM.00043-10 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXht1WmsL%2FO; Claesson, M.J., O'Sullivan, O., Wang, Q., Nikkila, J., Marchesi, J.R., Smidt, H., De Vos, W.M., O'Toole, P.W., Comparative analysis of pyrosequencing and a phylogenetic microarray for exploring microbial community structures in the human distal intestine (2009) PLoS ONE, 4 (8), pp. 1-15. , 10.1371/journal.pone.0006669; Cole, J.R., Wang, Q., Cardenas, E., Fish, J., Chai, B., Farris, R.J., Kulam-Syed-Mohideen, A.S., Tiedje, J.M., The ribosomal database project: Improved alignments and new tools for rRNA analysis (2008) Nucleic Acids Res, 40 (7), pp. 141-145; D'Souza, N.A., Allen, M.S., Stevens, K., Ayre, B., Visi, D.K., Vidhate, S., Ghamarian, I., Webber III, C.L., Biocomposites: The natural fiber contribution from bast and woody plants (2011) Plant Fibers as Renewable Feedstocks for Biofuel and Bio-based Products, pp. 75-95. , C.L.

Florigen, encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) in tomato, acts as a general growth hormone, advancing determinate growth. Domestication of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) converted it from a lanky photoperiodic perennial to a highly inbred, compact day-neutral plant that is managed as an annual row-crop. This dramatic change in plant architecture provides a unique opportunity to analyze the transition from perennial to annual growth. To explore these architectural changes, we addressed the role of day-length upon flowering in an ancestral, perennial accession and in a domesticated variety of cotton. Using a disarmed Cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCrV) as a transient expression system, we delivered FT to both cotton accessions. Ectopic expression of FT in ancestral cotton mimicked the effects of day-length, promoting photoperiod-independent flowering, precocious determinate architecture, and lanceolate leaf shape. Domesticated cotton infected with FT demonstrated more synchronized fruiting and enhanced ""annualization"". Transient expression of FT also facilitated simple crosses between wild photoperiodic and domesticated day-neutral accessions, effectively demonstrating a mechanism to increase genetic diversity among cultivated lines of cotton. Virus was not detected in the F(1) progeny, indicating that crosses made by this approach do not harbor recombinant DNA molecules. These findings extend our understanding of FT as a general growth hormone that regulates shoot architecture by advancing organ-specific and age-related determinate growth. Judicious manipulation of FT could benefit cotton architecture to improve crop management.",,"florigen; primer DNA; article; biolistic transformation; flower; Geminivirus; genetics; Gossypium; growth, development and aging; nucleotide sequence; photoperiodicity; physiology; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; Base Sequence; Biolistics; DNA Primers; Florigen; Flowers; Geminiviridae; Gossypium; Photoperiod; Plasmids; Polymerase Chain Reaction",,"DNA Primers; Florigen",,,,,"McGarry, R.C.",,,,,,,,19326203,,,22615805,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866164387

The CENTRORADIALIS/TERMINAL FLOWER 1/SELF-PRUNING (CETS) gene family shares homology to phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP) genes and is prominent in controlling the timing and location of the developmental transition from indeterminate to determinate growth, with different family members balancing the activities of others through antagonistic functions. The CETS members FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) of Arabidopsis and related genes (e.g. SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS, SFT, in tomato) are important in promoting the transition to determinate growth while TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) and its homologs (e.g. tomato SELF PRUNING, SP) oppose this activity by maintaining meristems in an indeterminate state. FT orthologs, and perhaps other CETS family members, act as mobile proteinaceous hormones, and can amplify their impact by accumulating in recipient organs. A universal model is emerging for the timing and placement of determinate and indeterminate growth through a balance of FT-like and TFL1-like gene activities, and it is now clear that the domestication of many wild exotics into crops with desired growth habits resulted from selection of altered FT/TFL1 balances. Manipulating this ratio further, through transgenic or viral-based technologies, holds promise for improved agricultural sustainability. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Centroradialis/Terminal Flower 1/Self-Pruning (CETS); Determinate/Indeterminate; Flowering Locus T (FT); Meristems; Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP); Sympodial growth","Arabidopsis protein; FT protein, Arabidopsis; phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein; TFL1 protein, Arabidopsis; vegetable protein; flower; genetics; growth, development and aging; histology; meristem; metabolism; multigene family; plant; review; Arabidopsis Proteins; Flowers; Meristem; Multigene Family; Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein; Plant Proteins; Plants; Arabidopsis; Lycopersicon esculentum",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; FT protein, Arabidopsis; Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein; Plant Proteins; TFL1 protein, Arabidopsis",,,,"Sussex, I.M., Kerk, N.M., The evolution of plant architecture (2001) Curr.

We conducted studies on pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) to determine the origin and composition of the exudate. Morphometric analysis indicated that the exudate is too voluminous to derive exclusively from the phloem. Cold, which inhibits phloem transport, did not interfere with exudation. However, ice water applied to the roots, which reduces root pressure, rapidly diminished exudation rate. Sap was seen by microscopic examination to flow primarily from the fascicular phloem in cucumber, and several other cucurbit species, but primarily from the extrafascicular phloem in pumpkin. Following exposure of leaves to 14CO 2, radiolabeled stachyose and other sugars were detected in the exudate in proportions expected of authentic phloem sap. Most of this radiolabel was released during the first 20 s. Sugars in exudate were dilute. The sugar composition of exudate from extrafascicular phloem near the edge of the stem differed from that of other sources in that it was high in hexose and low in stachyose. We conclude that sap is released from cucurbit phloem upon wounding but contributes negligibly to total exudate volume. The sap is diluted by water from cut cells, the apoplast, and the xylem. Small amounts of dilute, mobile sap from sieve elements can be obtained, although there is evidence that it is contaminated by the contents of other cell types. The function of P-proteins may be to prevent water loss from the xylem as well as nutrient loss from the phloem. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In animal systems this reaction is part of the ""endocannabinoid"" signaling pathway, which regulates a variety of physiological processes. The signaling function of NAE is terminated by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH, which hydrolyzes NAE to ethanolamine and free fatty acid. Our previous work in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that overexpression of AtFAAH (At5g64440 lowered endogenous levels of NAEs in seeds, consistent with its role in NAE signal termination. Reduced NAE levels were accompanied by an accelerated growth phenotype, increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA, enhanced susceptibility to bacterial pathogens, and early flowering. Here we investigated the nature of the early flowering phenotype of AtFAAH overexpression. AtFAAH overexpressors flowered several days earlier than wild type and AtFAAH knockouts under both non-inductive short day (SD and inductive long day (LD conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT gene, which plays a major role in regulating flowering time, and one target MADS box transcription factor, SEPATALLA3 (SEP3, were elevated in AtFAAH overexpressors. Furthermore, AtFAAH overexpressors, with the early flowering phenotype had lower endogenous NAE levels in leaves compared to wild type prior to flowering. Exogenous application of NAE 12:0, which was reduced by up to 30% in AtFAAH overexpressors, delayed the onset of flowering in wild type plants. We conclude that the early flowering phenotype of AtFAAH overexpressors is, in part, explained by elevated FT gene expression resulting from the enhanced NAE hydrolase activity of AtFAAH, suggesting that NAE metabolism may participate in floral signaling pathways. © 2012 Teaster, Keereetaweep, Kilaru, Wang, Tang, Tran, Ayre, Chapman and Blancaflor.","Arabidopsis; Fatty acid amide hydrolase; Flowering; FLOWERING LOCUS T; Lipid signaling; N-acylethanalomanine",,,,,,,"Abdi, H., Bonferroni and Sidak corrections for multiple comparisons (2007) Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics, pp. 103-107. , in, ed.

Here we show that TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE11 (TPS11) gene-dependent trehalose metabolism regulates Arabidopsis thaliana defense against Myzus persicae (Sülzer), commonly known as the green peach aphid (GPA). GPA infestation of Arabidopsis resulted in a transient increase in trehalose and expression of the TPS11 gene, which encodes a trehalose-6- phosphate synthase/phosphatase. Knockout of TPS11 function abolished trehalose increases in GPA-infested leaves of the tps11 mutant plant and attenuated defense against GPA. Trehalose application restored resistance in the tps11 mutant, confirming that the lack of trehalose accumulation is associated with the inability of the tps11 mutant to control GPA infestation. Resistance against GPA was also higher in the trehalose hyper-accumulating tre1 mutant and in bacterial otsB gene-expressing plants, further supporting the conclusion that trehalose plays a role in Arabidopsis defense against GPA. Evidence presented here indicates that TPS11-dependent trehalose regulates expression of the PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 gene, which is a key modulator of defenses against GPA. TPS11 also promotes the re-allocation of carbon into starch at the expense of sucrose, the primary plant-derived carbon and energy source for the insect. Our results provide a framework for the signaling function of TPS11-dependent trehalose in plant stress responses, and also reveal an important contribution of starch in controlling the severity of aphid infestation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","anti-xenosis; antibiosis; green peach aphid; PAD4; plant defense; trehalose metabolism","anti-xenosis; antibiosis; Green peach aphids; PAD4; Plant defense; Trehalose metabolism; Metabolism; Physiology; Plants (botany); Productivity; Starch; Sugar (sucrose); Gene expression; Arabidopsis protein; carboxylesterase; glucosyltransferase; PAD4 protein, Arabidopsis; phosphatase; starch; sucrose; trehalose; trehalose 6 phosphate synthetase; trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; trehalose-phosphatase; trehalosephosphatase; animal; antibiosis; aphid; Arabidopsis; article; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; plant disease; plant immunity; plant leaf; signal transduction; Animals; Antibiosis; Aphids; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucosyltransferases; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaves; Sequence Deletion; Signal Transduction; Starch; Stress, Physiological; Sucrose; Trehalose; Aphididae; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hexapoda; Myzus persicae; Prunus persica",,"carboxylesterase, 59536-71-9, 83380-83-0, 9016-18-6, 9028-01-7; glucosyltransferase, 9031-48-5; phosphatase, 9013-05-2; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; trehalose, 99-20-7; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases, 3.1.1.-; Glucosyltransferases, 2.4.1.-; PAD4 protein, Arabidopsis, 3.1.1.-; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, 3.1.3.-; Starch, 9005-25-8; Sucrose, 57-50-1; Trehalose, 99-20-7; trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, 2.4.1.15; trehalose-phosphatase, 3.1.3.12",,,,"Blackman, R.L., Eastop, V.F., (2002) Aphids on the World's Crops: An Identification and Information Guide, , 2nd edn.

Transport mechanisms and efficiency influence photosynthetic productivity by relieving product inhibition and contribute to plant vigor by controlling source/sink relationships and biomass partitioning. Sucrose is synthesized in the cytoplasm and may move cell to cell through plasmodesmata or may cross membranes to be compartmentalized or exported to the apoplasm for uptake into adjacent cells. As a relatively large polar compound, sucrose requires proteins to facilitate efficient membrane transport. Transport across the tonoplast by facilitated diffusion, antiport with protons, and symport with protons have been proposed; for transport across plasma membranes, symport with protons and a mechanism resembling facilitated diffusion are evident. Despite decades of research, only symport with protons is well established at the molecular level. This review aims to integrate recent and older studies on sucrose flux across membranes with principles of whole-plant carbon partitioning. © 2011 The Author.","Carbohydrate metabolism; gene expression; membrane proteins; molecular transport; phloem physiology","carbon; sucrose; vegetable protein; intracellular membrane; metabolism; plant; review; transport at the cellular level; Biological Transport; Carbon; Intracellular Membranes; Plant Proteins; Plants; Sucrose",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Plant Proteins; Sucrose, 57-50-1",,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Bush, D.R., Carbohydrate export from the leaf: A highly regulated process and target to enhance photosynthesis and productivity (2011) Plant Physiol., 155, pp. 64-69; Aloni, B., Wyse, R.E., Griffith, S., Sucrose transport and phloem unloading in stem of Vicia faba: Possible involvement of a sucrose carrier and osmotic regulation (1986) Plant Physiol., 81, pp. 482-486; Anderson, J.M., Release of sucrose from Vicia faba L. leaf discs (1983) Plant Physiol., 71, pp. 333-340; Aoki, N., Hirose, T., Scofield, G.N., Whitfeld, P.R., Furbank, R.T., The sucrose transporter gene family in rice (2003) Plant and Cell Physiology, 44 (3), pp. 223-232. , DOI 10.1093/pcp/pcg030; Aoki, N., Hirose, T., Takahashi, S., Ono, K., Ishimaru, K., Ohsugi, R., Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a gene for a sucrose transporter in maize (Zea mays L.)

The P450SU1gene from the soil bacteria Streptomyces griseolus encodes CYP105A1 which acts on various substrates including sulfonylurea herbicides, vitamin D, coumarins, and based on the work presented here, brassinosteroids. P450SU1is used as a negative-selection marker in plants because CYP105A1 converts the relatively benign sulfonyl urea pro-herbicide R7402 into a highly phytotoxic product. Consistent with its use for negative selection, transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated with P450SU1situated between recognition sequences for FLP recombinase from yeast to select for recombinase-mediated excision. However, unexpected and prominent developmental aberrations resembling those described for mutants defective in brassinosteroid signaling were observed in many of the lines.Results: The phenotypes of the most affected lines included severe stunting, leaf curling, darkened leaves characteristic of anthocyanin accumulation, delayed transition to flowering, low pollen and seed yields, and delayed senescence. Phenotype severity correlated with P450SU1transcript abundance, but not with transcript abundance of other experimental genes, strongly implicating CYP105A1 as responsible for the defects. Germination and seedling growth of transgenic and control lines in the presence and absence of 24-epibrassinolide indicated that CYP105A1 disrupts brassinosteroid signaling, most likely by inactivating brassinosteroids.Conclusions: Despite prior use of this gene as a genetic tool, deleterious growth in the absence of R7402 has not been elaborated. We show that this gene can cause aberrant growth by disrupting brassinosteroid signaling and affecting homeostasis. © 2011 Dasgupta et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Arabidopsis; Streptomyces; Streptomyces griseolus;

Plants harbouring homozygous AtSUC2 null alleles accumulate sugar, starch, and anthocyanin in mature leaves, have severely delayed development and stunted growth and, in previous studies, failed to complete their life cycle by producing viable seed. Methods An AtSUC2 allele with a T-DNA insertion in the second intron was analysed. Full-length transcript from this allele is not produced, and a truncated protein translated from sequences upstream of the insertion site did not catalyse sucrose uptake into yeast, supporting the contention that this is a null allele. Mutant plants were grown in a growth chamber with a diurnal light/dark cycle, and growth patterns recorded. Key Results This allele (SALK-038124, designated AtSUC2-4) has the hallmarks of previously described null alleles but, despite compromised carbon partitioning and growth, produces viable seeds. The onset of flowering was chronologically delayed but occurred at the same point in the plastochron index as wild type. Conclusions AtSUC2 is important for phloem loading and is therefore fundamental to phloem transport and plant productivity, but plants can complete their life cycle and produce viable seed in its absence. Arabidopsis appears to have mechanisms for mobilizing reduced carbon from the phloem into developing seeds independent of AtSUC2.","Arabidopsis thaliana; AtSUC2; Phloem; Phloem loading; Plant productivity; Sucrose; Symporter; Transporter","bacterial DNA; carrier protein; cellulose; cotransporter; proton; starch; sucrose; sucrose transport protein, plant; T DNA; T-DNA; vegetable protein; allele; biological production; dicotyledon; DNA; life cycle; mutation; phloem; pigment; protein; starch; sucrose; viability; Arabidopsis; article; carbohydrate metabolism; cytology; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; phloem; plant epidermis; plant leaf; plant seed; seedling; transport at the cellular level; Arabidopsis; Biological Transport; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cellulose; DNA, Bacterial; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Mutation; Phloem; Plant Epidermis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Protons; Seedling; Seeds; Starch; Sucrose; Symporters; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",,"carrier protein, 80700-39-6; cellulose, 61991-22-8, 68073-05-2, 9004-34-6; proton, 12408-02-5, 12586-59-3; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; Cellulose, 9004-34-6; DNA, Bacterial; Membrane Transport Proteins; Plant Proteins; Protons; Starch, 9005-25-8; Sucrose, 57-50-1; Symporters; T-DNA; sucrose transport protein, plant",,,,"Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; Baker, R.F., Braun, D.M., Tie-dyed1 functions non-cell autonomously to control carbohydrate accumulation in maize leaves (2007) Plant Physiology, 144, pp. 867-878; Baker, R.F., Braun, D.M., Tie-dyed2 functions with tie-dyed1 to promote carbohydrate export from maize leaves (2008) Plant Physiology, 146, pp. 1085-1097; Baud, S., Wuilleme, S., Lemoine, R., The AtSUC5 sucrose transporter specifically expressed in the endosperm is involved in early seed development in Arabidopsis (2005) The Plant Journal, 43, pp. 824-836; Van Bel, A.J.E., Hess, P.H., Hexoses as phloem transport sugars the end of a dogma?

Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L., Malvaceae) produces high yields of lignocellulosic bast fibers in the bark layer, and is a promising crop for supplying emerging fiber markets. Bast fibers are bundles of cells that undergo extensive cell-wall thickening during maturation. Bundle maturity is therefore an important determinant of the fibers' mechanical properties and ultimately contributes to their quality in specific applications. Fiber bundles in stem sections of progressive age were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy, and viscoelastic properties determined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. Early-forming primary fibers were larger than later-forming secondary fibers, but cell-wall thickening contributed most to elastic and viscous response of the fiber.","Fabric formation; Fiber; Performance; Processing; Properties; Strength; Yarn","Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis; Epifluorescence microscopy; Fiber bundles; Fiber markets; Hibiscus cannabinus; High yield; Kenaf bast fibers; Malvaceae; Performance; Physical and chemical properties; Primary fibers; Properties; Strength; Viscoelastic properties; Viscous response; Wall thickening; Biomechanics; Cell membranes; Chemical properties; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Fabrics; Hemp; Industrial applications; Kenaf fibers; Natural fibers; Thermoanalysis; Viscoelasticity; Wool; Yarn; Mechanical properties; Chemical Properties; Fabric; Fibers; Formation; Hemp; Kenaf; Mechanical Properties; Natural Fibers; Performance; Processing; Viscoelasticity; Wool; Yarn; bast fiber; chemical property; kenaf fiber; mechanical property; physical property; strength; thermal analysis; viscoelasticity",,,,,,"Webber III, C.L., Bhardwaj, H.L., Bledsoe, V.K., Kenaf Production: Fiber, Feed, and Seed (2002) ""Trends in New Crops and New Uses"", pp. 327-339. , In (Janick, J., and Whipkey, A., Eds.), ASHS Press, Alexandria, VA, USA; Anandjiwala, R.D., Blouw, S., Composites from Bast Fibers: Prospects and Potential in the Changing Market Environment (2007) J.

AtSUC2 (At1g22710) from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a phloem-localized sucrose/proton symporter required for efficient photoassimilate transport from source tissues to sink tissues. AtSUC2 plays a key role in coordinating the demands of sink tissues with the output capacity of source leaves, and in maintaining phloem hydrostatic pressure during changes in plant-water balance. Expression and activity are regulated, both positively and negatively, by developmental (sink to source transition) and environmental cues, including light, diurnal changes, photoassimilate levels, turgor pressure, drought and osmotic stress, and hormones. Results. To assess the importance of this regulation to whole-plant growth and carbon partitioning, AtSUC2 cDNA was expressed from two exotic, phloem-specific promoters in a mutant background debilitated for AtSUC2 function. The first was a promoter element from Commelina Yellow Mottle Virus (CoYMV), and the second was the rolC promoter from Agrobacterium rhizogenes. CoYMVp::AtSUC2 cDNA restored growth and carbon partitioning to near wild-type levels, whereas plants harboring rolCp::AtSUC2 cDNA showed only partial complementation. Conclusion. Expressing AtSUC2 cDNA from exotic, phloem-specific promoters argues that strong, phloem-localized expression is sufficient for efficient transport. Expressing AtSUC2 from promoters that foster efficient phloem transport but are subject to regulatory cascades different from the endogenous sucrose/proton symporter genes has implications for biotechnology.",,"Agrobacterium rhizogenes; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Commelina; Commelina yellow mottle virus; Arabidopsis protein; bacterial DNA; carbon; carrier protein; complementary DNA; plant DNA; sucrose; sucrose transport protein, plant; T DNA; T-DNA; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; carbohydrate metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; phloem; promoter region; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Phloem; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Sucrose",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carrier protein, 80700-39-6; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbon, 7440-44-0; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; Membrane Transport Proteins; Plant Proteins; sucrose transport protein, plant; Sucrose, 57-50-1; T-DNA",,,,"Lalonde, S., Tegeder, M., Throne-Holst, M., Frommer, W.B., Patrick, J.W., Phloem loading and unloading of sugars and amino acids (2003) Plant Cell Environ, 26, pp. 37-56; Thompson, M.V., Phloem: The long and the short of it (2006) Trends Plant Sci, 11, pp. 26-32. , 16356759; Turgeon, R., Ayre, B.G., Pathways and mechanisms of phloem loading (2005) Vascular Transport in Plants, pp. 45-67. , New York: Elsevier Academic Press Holbrook NM, Zwieniecki MA; Van Bel, A.J.E., Hafke, J.B., Physiochemical determinants of phloem transport (2005) Vascular Transport in Plants, pp. 19-44. , New York: Elsevier Academic Press Holbrook NM, Zwieniecki MA; Giaquinta, R.T., Phloem loading of sucrose. pH dependence and selectivity (1977) Plant Physiol, 59, pp. 750-753. , 16659931; Sauer, N., Molecular physiology of higher plant sucrose transporters (2007) FEBS Lett, 581, pp. 2309-2317. , 17434165; Wright, K.M., Roberts, A.G., Martens, H.J., Sauer, N., Oparka, K.J., Structural and functional vein maturation in developing tobacco leaves in relation to AtSUC2 promoter activity (2003) Plant Physiol, 131, pp. 1555-1565. , 12692315; Chincinska, I.A., Liesche, J., Krugel, U., Michalska, J., Geigenberger, P., Grimm, B., Kuhn, C., Sucrose transporter StSUT4 from potato affects flowering, tuberization, and shade avoidance response (2008) Plant Physiol, 146, pp. 515-528. , 18083796; Kuhn, C., Franceschi, V.R., Schulz, A., Lemoine, R., Frommer, W.B., Macromolecular trafficking indicated by localization and turnover of sucrose transporters in enucleate sieve elements (1997) Science, 275, pp. 1298-1300. , 9036853; Vaughn, M.W., Harrington, G.N., Bush, D.R., Sucrose-mediated transcriptional regulation of sucrose symporter activity in the phloem (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 99, pp. 10876-10880. , 12149483; Ransom-Hodgkins, W.D., Vaughn, M.W., Bush, D.R., Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in sucrose-mediated transcriptional regulation of a phloem-specific proton-sucrose symporter (2003) Planta, 217, pp. 483-489. , 14520575; Baker, R.F., Braun, D.M., Tie-dyed2 functions with tie-dyed1 to promote carbohydrate export from maize leaves (2008) Plant Physiol, 146, pp. 1085-1097. , 18218972; Baker, R.F., Braun, D.M., Tie-dyed1 functions non-cell autonomously to control carbohydrate accumulation in maize leaves (2007) Plant Physiol, 144, pp. 867-878. , 17434986; Smith, J.A.C., Milburn, J.A., Phloem turgor and the regulation of sucrose loading in Ricinus communis L (1980) Planta, 148, pp. 42-48; Aloni, B., Wyse, R.E., Griffith, S., Sucrose transport and phloem unloading in stem of Vicia faba possible involvement of a sucrose carrier and osmotic regulation (1986) Plant Physiol, 81, pp. 482-486. , 16664842; Daie, J., Metabolic adjustments, assimilate partitioning, and alterations in source-sink relations in drought-stressed plants (1996) Photoassimilate Distribution in Plants and Crops Source-Sink Relationships, pp. 407-420. , New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc Zamski E, Schaffer AA; Sung, F.J.M., Krieg, D.R., Relative sensitivity of photosynthetic assimilation and translocation of 14Carbon to water stress (1979) Plant Physiol, 64, pp. 852-856. , 16661068; Grennan, A.K., Genevestigator.

Mulberry, 305220, Denton, TX 76203 5220, United States","Background. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L) is an important crop worldwide that provides fiber for the textile industry. Cotton is a perennial plant that stores starch in stems and roots to provide carbohydrates for growth in subsequent seasons. Domesticated cotton makes these reserves available to developing seeds which impacts seed yield. The goals of these analyses were to identify genes and physiological pathways that establish cotton stems and roots as physiological sinks and investigate the role these pathways play in cotton development during seed set. Results. Analysis of field-grown cotton plants indicated that starch levels peaked about the time of first anthesis and then declined similar to reports in greenhouse-grown cotton plants. Starch accumulated along the length of the stem and the shape and size of the starch grains from stems were easily distinguished from transient starch. Microarray analyses compared gene expression in tissues containing low levels of starch with tissues rapidly accumulating starch. Statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated increased expression among genes associated with starch synthesis, starch degradation, hexose metabolism, raffinose synthesis and trehalose synthesis. The anticipated changes in these sugars were largely confirmed by measuring soluble sugars in selected tissues. Conclusion. In domesticated cotton starch stored prior to flowering was available to support seed production. Starch accumulation observed in young field-grown plants was not observed in greenhouse grown plants. A suite of genes associated with starch biosynthesis was identified. The pathway for starch utilization after flowering was associated with an increase in expression of a glucan water dikinase gene as has been implicated in utilization of transient starch. Changes in raffinose levels and levels of expression of genes controlling trehalose and raffinose biosynthesis were also observed in vegetative cotton tissues as plants age. © 2009 Taliercio et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Gossypium hirsutum; plant RNA; starch; article; carbohydrate metabolism; cotton; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; plant gene; plant root; plant stem; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Gossypium; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plant Roots; Plant Stems; RNA, Plant; Starch",,"starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; RNA, Plant; Starch, 9005-25-8",,,,"Graves, A.D., Stewart, M.J., Chronology of the differentiation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber cells (1988) Planta, 175, pp. 254-258. , 10.1007/BF00392435; Constable, G.A., Rawson, H.M., Carbon production and utilization in cotton: Inferences from a carbon budget (1980) Aus J Plant Physiol, 7, pp. 539-553; Pettigrew, W.T., McCarty Jr., J.C., Vaughn, K.C., Leaf senescence-like characteristics contribute to cotton's premature photosynthetic decline (2000) Photosynthesis Res, 65, pp. 187-195. , 10.1023/A:1006455524955; De Souza, J.G., Viera Da Silva, J., Partitioning of carbohydrates in annual and perennial cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)

After maturation, minor vein phloem maintains its character in part through minor-vein specific regulatory cascades; however despite its physiological significance, little of these developmental programs is understood. From an Arabidopsis enhancer trap screen, we identified MATURE MINOR VEIN ELEMENT1 (MMVE1) in the intergenic region between two oppositely oriented genes, the ABC transporter ATM1 (At4g28630) and IAA11 (At4g28640). MMVE1 promotes reporter gene activity in minor vein phloem in a pattern resembling the sink to source transition. Promoter truncation experiments and phylogenetic footprinting demonstrate sequences proximal to ATM1 promote minor vein expression whereas sequences closer to IAA11 repress it. Both orientations of the promoter were used to drive expression of CONSTANS to generate a phloem mobile signal conferring early flowering under non-inductive conditions. Tandem copies of MMVE1 increase minor vein expression strength and specificity. MMVE1 is the first minor vein enhancer characterized from a species that loads from the apoplast, and supports the presence of unique regulatory cascades operating in minor vein phloem. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Enhancer trap;

AtSUC2 is highly expressed in the collection phloem of mature leaves, and its function in phloem loading is well established. AtSUC2, however, is also expressed strongly in the transport phloem, where its role is more ambiguous, and it has been implicated in mediating both efflux and retrieval to and from flanking tissues via the apoplast. To characterize the role of AtSUC2 in controlling carbon partitioning along the phloem path, AtSUC2 cDNA was expressed from tissue-specific promoters in an Atsuc2 mutant background. Suc transport in this mutant is highly compromised, as indicated by stunted growth and the accumulation of large quantities of sugar and starch in vegetative tissues. Expression of AtSUC2 cDNA from the 2-kb AtSUC2 promoter was sufficient to restore growth and carbon partitioning to nearly wild-type levels. The GALACTINOL SYNTHASE promoter of Cucumis melo (CmGAS1p) confers expression only in the minor veins of mature leaves, not in the transport phloem of larger leaf veins and stems. Mutant plants expressing AtSUC2 cDNA from CmGAS1p had intermediate growth and accumulated sugar and starch, but otherwise they had normal morphology. These characteristics support a role for AtSUC2 in retrieval but not efflux along the transport phloem and show that the only vital function of AtSUC2 in photoassimilate distribution is phloem loading. In addition, Atsuc2 mutant plants, although debilitated, do grow, and AtSUC2-independent modes of phloem transport are discussed, including an entirely symplastic pathway from mesophyll cells to sink tissues. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Cucumis melo; carbon; carrier protein; galactosyltransferase; inositol 1 alpha galactosyltransferase; inositol 1-alpha-galactosyltransferase; sucrose transport protein, plant; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; cantaloupe; carbohydrate metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetic complementation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phloem; plant leaf; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon Radioisotopes; Cucumis melo; Galactosyltransferases; Genetic Complementation Test; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Phloem; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carrier protein, 80700-39-6; galactosyltransferase, 9031-68-9; Carbon Radioisotopes; Galactosyltransferases, EC 2.4.1.-; inositol 1-alpha-galactosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.123; Membrane Transport Proteins; Plant Proteins; sucrose transport protein, plant",,,,"Aloni, B., Wyse, R.E., Griffith, S., Sucrose transport and phloem unloading in stem of Vicia faba: Possible involvement of a sucrose carrier and osmotic regulation (1986) Plant Physiol, 81, pp. 482-486; Alonso, J.M., Stepanova, A.N., Leisse, T.J., Kim, C.J., Chen, H., Shinn, P., Stevenson, D.K., Cheuk, R., Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis (2003) Science, 301, pp. 653-657; (2002) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , Ausubel FM, Brent R, Kingston RE, Moore DD, Seidman JG, Smith JA, Struhl K, editors , Ed 5.

Seeds of numerous transgenic plant lines had reduced oil content compared with null-segregating siblings or nontransformed seeds. Seed oil content was quantified by 1H-NMR, and was reduced to 12% or less of seed weight in transgenics from 20% by weight in nontransformed controls. Light- and electron-microscopic analyses of severely lowered lines, showed a reduction in overall cotyledon thickness and a disruption in cellular and subcellular organization. Lipid bodies and protein bodies were fewer in transgenics, and their size and distribution in cells was different than that in nontransformed seeds. Coincident with reduced storage reserves, sucrose levels were elevated in transgenic seeds. The overall effect of oil suppression was to selectively reduce the size of the embryo, but the seed coat and fiber properties remained unaffected in seeds. In fact there was a significant increase in lint percentage in all oil-suppressed lines examined. Overall we propose that expression of the nonfunctional Bnfad2 allele in cottonseeds disrupts normal oil biosynthesis and provides for redirection of carbon reserves. © Crop Science Society of America.

By this process, solute is actively concentrated in the phloem of source organs, primarily mature leaves, thus generating hydrostatic pressure. Phloem loading can only be understood by detailed examination of the routes of sugar movement from mesophyll cells to sieve elements. Mapping these routes and determining the mode of transport at different interfaces are challenging, as the pathways are complex, the distances short, and the transport compounds soluble in the solvents normally used to prepare tissues for microscopy. Since the accumulation process generally takes place against a concentration gradient, it requires metabolic energy. Although it is useful to think of ""loading"" as the entire transport process, from mesophyll cells to sieve elements, it is important to remember that the term loading implies the expenditure of energy. It was first described as an ""endothermic pumping action."" Therefore, in specific terms phloem loading is the final, active step or mechanism that carries molecules against their thermodynamic gradient into the phloem. Plasmodesmata are present at every interface in a leaf along the photoassimilate transport pathway, from mesophyll cells to sieve elements. Although transport routes are often referred to as symplastic or apoplastic, one should perhaps think of these as quantitative, rather than strictly qualitative, differences. It is possible that both pathways contribute to photoassimilate flux, more so at some interfaces than at others. This chapter discusses the potential for symplastic and apoplastic transport across each interface to provide a framework for further exploration of the mechanisms and regulation of phloem loading. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

CONSTANS (CO) is implicated as a mediator between photoperiod perception and the transition to flowering in Arabidopsis. To test the role of CO in long-distance signaling, CO was expressed from a promoter specific to the companion cells of the smallest veins of mature leaves. This expression in tissues at the inception of the phloem translocation stream was sufficient to accelerate flowering at the apical meristem under noninductive (short-day) conditions. Grafts that conjoined the vegetative stems of plants with different flower-timing phenotypes demonstrated that minor-vein expression of CO is able to substitute for photoperiod in generating a mobile flowering signal. Our results suggest that a CO-derived signal(s), or possibly CO itself, fits the definition of the hypothetical flowering stimulant, florigen.",,"Arabidopsis; Flowering; Graft transmission; Plant cell culture;

Phloem loading of transport sugars occurs in the minor veins, and consistent with this, galactinol synthase is expressed in the minor veins of melon (Cucumis melo) as part of the symplastic-loading mechanism that operates in this species. A galactinol synthase promoter from melon drives gene expression in the minor-vein companion cells of both transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Arabidopsis. Neither of these plants use galactinol in the phloem-loading process, implying that the promoter responds to a minor-vein-specific regulatory cascade that is highly conserved across a broad range of eudicotyledons. Detailed analysis of this promoter by truncation and mutagenesis identified three closely coupled sequences that unambiguously modulate tissue specificity. These sequences cooperate in a combinatorial fashion: two promote expression throughout the vascular system of the plant, whereas the third functions to repress expression in the larger bundles. In a complementary approach, phylogenetic footprinting was used to obtain single-nucleotide resolution of conserved sites in orthologous promoters from diverse members of the Cucurbitaceae. This comparative analysis confirmed the importance of the closely coupled sites but also revealed other highly conserved sequences that may modulate promoter strength or contribute to expression patterns outside of the phloem. The conservation of this regulatory design among species that phloem load by different mechanisms supports a model for organismal development in which tissues and cell types are controlled by relatively ancient and conserved paradigms but expression of genes influencing final form and function are relatively plastic.",,"Genes;

To test this hypothesis, the distributions of exotic and endogenous solutes synthesized in the CCs of minor veins were studied. Octopine, a charged molecule derived from arginine and pyruvate, was efficiently transported through the phloem but was also transferred in substantial amounts to the apoplast, and presumably other non-phloem compartments. The disaccharide galactinol also accumulated in non-phloem compartments, but long-distance transport was limited. Conversely, sucrose, raffinose, and especially stachyose demonstrated reduced accumulation and efficient transport out of the leaf. We conclude that small metabolites in the cytosol of CCs do enter the translocation stream indiscriminately but are also subject to distributive forces, such as nonselective and carrier-mediated membrane transport and symplastic dispersal, that may effectively clear a compound from the phloem or retain it for long-distance transport. A model is proposed in which the transport of oligosaccharides is an adaptive strategy to improve photoassimilate retention, and consequently translocation efficiency, in the phloem.",,"Amino acids; Carbohydrates; Cell membranes; Molecules; Synthesis (chemical); Companion cells; Cells; Arginine; Benzofurans; Biological Transport, Active; Coleus; Disaccharides; Plant Components; Plants, Genetically Modified; Raffinose; Spiro Compounds; Sucrose; Tobacco",,"6 beta-galactinol, 3687-64-7; Arginine, 74-79-3; Benzofurans; Disaccharides; octopine, 34522-32-2; Raffinose, 512-69-6; Spiro Compounds; stachybocin A; Sucrose, 57-50-1",,,,"Ausubel, F., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidmam, J.G., Smith, J.A., (1995) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ed 3, , John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York; Bachmann, M., Keller, F., Metabolism of the raffinose family oligosaccharides in leaves of Ajuga reptans L.: Intercellular and intracellular compartmentation (1995) Plant Physiol, 109, pp. 991-998; Becker, D., Kemper, E., Schell, J., Masterson, R., New plant binary vectors with selectable markers located proximal to the left T-DNA border (1992) Plant Mol Biol, 20, pp. 1195-1197; Beebe, D.U., Turgeon, R., Localization of galactinol, raffinose, and stachyose synthesis in Cucurbita pepo leaves (1992) Planta, 188, pp. 354-361; Bennet, A.B., Damon, S., Osteryoung, K., Hewitt, J., Mechanisms of retrieval and metabolism following phloem unloading (1986) Phloem Transport, pp. 307-316. , J Cronshaw, WJ Lucas, RT Giaquinta, eds.

In doing so, a chimeric mRNA can be produced, and new gene activities triggered in living cells dependent on the presence of the target mRNA. Based on this ability of trans-splicing ribozymes to deliver new gene activities, a simple and versatile plating assay was developed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for assessing and optimizing constructs in vivo. Trans-splicing ribozymes were used to splice sequences encoding a GAL4-derived transcription activator into a target transcript from a prevalent viral pathogen. The transcription activator translated from this new mRNA in turn triggered the expression of genes under the regulatory control of GAL4 upstream-activating sequences. Two of the activated genes complemented metabolic deficiencies in the host strain, and allowed growth on selective media. A simple genetic assay based on phenotypic conversion from auxotrophy to prototrophy was established to select efficient and specific trans-splicing ribozymes from a ribozyme library. This simple assay may prove valuable for selecting optimal target sites for therapeutic agents such as ribozymes, antisense RNA and antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides, and for optimizing the design of the therapeutic agents themselves, in higher eukaryotes.",,"GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae; green fluorescent protein; hybrid protein; photoprotein; ribozyme; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; transcription factor; article; cell division; enzyme specificity; genetic complementation; genetic transformation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; plasmid; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Cell Division; Genetic Complementation Test; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Luminescent Proteins; Mutation; Plasmids; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; RNA, Catalytic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Substrate Specificity; Transcription Factors; Transformation, Genetic",,"GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Luminescent Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; RNA, Catalytic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,,"Ayre, B.G.email: bga2@cornell.edu",,,,,,,,13624962,,,12490732,"English","Nucleic Acids Res",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037114238

Generally, the term refers to the smallest vein classes in the leaf, believed to function in phloem loading. We found that a galactinol synthase promoter, cloned from melon (Cucumis melo), directs expression of the gusA gene to the smallest veins of mature Arabidopsis and cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. This expression pattern is consistent with the role of galactinol synthase in sugar synthesis and phloem loading in cucurbits. The expression pattern in tobacco is especially noteworthy since galactinol is not synthesized in the leaves of this plant. Also, we unexpectedly found that expression in tobacco is limited to two of three companion cells in class-V veins, which are the most extensive, in the leaf. Thus, the 'minor' vein system is defined and regulated at the genetic level, and there is heterogeneity of response to this system by different companion cells of the same vein.",,"carbohydrate synthesis; companion cell; galactinol synthase; genetic heterogeneity; genetic regulation; glucuronidase A; leaf vein; molecular cloning; phloem; promoter region; Arabidopsis; Blotting, Southern; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbohydrates; Cloning, Molecular; Cucurbitaceae; Galactosyltransferases; Genes, Reporter; Glucuronidase; Plant Leaves; Plants, Toxic; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Tobacco; Arabidopsis; Cucumis; Cucumis melo; Melo; Nicotiana tabacum; Tabacum",,"Carbohydrates; Galactosyltransferases, EC 2.4.1.-; Glucuronidase, EC 3.2.1.31; inositol 1-alpha-galactosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.123",,,,"Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Beebe, D.U., Turgeon, R., Localization of galactinol, raffinose, and stachyose synthesis in Cucurbita pepo leaves (1992) Planta, 188, pp. 354-361; Bernatzky, R., Tanksley, S.D., Genetics of actin-related sequences in tomato (1986) Theor Appl Genet, 72, pp. 314-321; Bingham, P.M., Levis, R., Rubin, G.M., Cloning of DNA sequences from the white locus of D.

We have targeted ribozymes against the coat protein mRNA of a widespread plant pathogen, cucumber mosaic virus. The ribozymes were designed to trans-splice the coding sequence of the diphtheria toxin A chain in frame with the viral initiation codon of the target sequence. Diphtheria toxin A chain catalyzes the ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 and can cause the cessation of protein translation. In a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system, ribozyme expression was shown to specifically inhibit the growth of cells expressing the virus mRNA. A point mutation at the target splice site alleviated this ribozyme-mediated toxicity. Increasing the extent of base pairing between the ribozyme and target dramatically increased specific expression of the cytotoxin and reduced illegitimate toxicity in vivo.

While such cleaving ribozymes may work well in vitro, they have not proved to be routinely effective in depleting living cells of the chosen target RNA. Recently, trans-splicing ribozymes have been employed to repair mutant mRNAs in vivo. We have designed modified trans-splicing ribozymes with improved biological activity. These allow accurate splicing of a new 3' exon sequence into a chosen site within a target RNA, and in frame fusion of the exon can result in expression of a new gene product. These trans-splicing ribozymes contain catalytic sequences derived from a self-splicing group I intron, which have been adapted to a chosen target mRNA by fusion of a region of extended complementarity to the target RNA and precise alteration of the guide sequences required for substrate recognition. Both modifications are required for improved biological activity of the ribozymes. Whereas cleaving ribozymes must efficiently deplete a chosen mRNA species to be effective in vivo, even inefficient in trans-splicing can allow the useful expression of a new gene activity, dependent on the presence of a chosen RNA. We have targeted trans-splicing ribozymes against mRNAs of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, human immunodeficiency virus, and cucumber mosaic virus, and demonstrated trans-splicing and delivery of a marker gene in Escherichia coli cells. The improved trans-splicing ribozymes may be tailored for virtually any target RNA, and provide a new tool for triggering gene expression in specific cell types.","Bioassay; CMV; Gene therapy; HIV; Tetrahymena thermophila","chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; complementary RNA; messenger RNA; ribozyme; article; controlled study; cucumber mosaic virus; escherichia coli; exon; gene expression; gene fusion; gene targeting; human immunodeficiency virus; intron; marker gene; nonhuman; priority journal; RNA splicing; Antiviral Agents; Base Sequence; beta-Galactosidase; Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase; Cucumovirus; Cytomegalovirus; Escherichia coli; Gene Transfer Techniques; HIV-1; Molecular Biology; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Recombinant Proteins; RNA Splicing; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Catalytic; RNA, Messenger; Substrate Specificity",,"Antiviral Agents; beta-Galactosidase, EC 3.2.1.23; Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.28; Recombinant Proteins; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Catalytic; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Amann, E., Brosius, J., Ptashne, M., Vectors bearing a hybrid trp-lac promoter useful for regulated expression of cloned genes in Escherichia coli (1983) Gene, 25, pp. 167-178; Been, M.D., Cech, T.R., Sites of circularization of the Tetrahymena rRNA IVS are determined by sequence and influenced by position and secondary structure (1985) Nucl.

In both cases, the induced mutation frequencies were substantially reduced. Furthermore, specific substitutions at positions in SUP4-o that had not been mutated by MNNG resulted in the recovery of MNNG-induced mutations at these sites. These results demonstrate that base-pair identity is an important factor determining the site-specific mutagenicity of UV and MNNG in yeast. For UV, our findings suggest that the type of lesion that is induced, but not flanking DNA sequences, plays a role in specifying mutability at the sites examined. In contrast, DNA sequence context seems to be an important factor for MNNG mutagenesis. © 1989.","DNA sequence changes; Mutational hotspots; Saccharomyces cerevisiae","dna structure; fungus; heredity; mutation; nonhuman; nucleic acid base substitution; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; suppressor gene; yeast; Base Composition; Genes, Fungal; Methylnitronitrosoguanidine; Mutation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Ultraviolet Rays",,"Methylnitronitrosoguanidine, 70-25-7",,,,"Bourre, Renault, Sarasin, Sequence effect on alkali-sites in UV-irradiated SV40 DNA (1987) Nucl.
