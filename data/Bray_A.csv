We deployed a wide range of quantitatively graded difficulties of both balance challenge and cognitive tasking to obtain an overview of the spectrum of their interactions in a multi-tasking situation. A differential comparison of the effects of verbally versus spatially loaded tasks, balanced for difficulty, was made and unlike any other study, we contrived to incorporate falls as an experimental variable. In the first study subjects stood in tandem on beams of either 2, 3 and 6 cm or 3, 6 and 8 cm width (according to 'best performance' ability) while performing mental verbal or spatial 'Stroop' tasks. The design was a between groups (sixteen subjects each) comparison (to reduce learning effect) of sway, fall rate and task error, balanced for order. Measurements were taken of centre of pressure, sway velocity at the hip and head displacement. For any beam width there were no within-subject correlations between sway magnitudes and frequency of falls. Spatial task errors increased with balance challenge (hence with magnitude of sway) but verbal performance was maintained independently of balance challenge. The results of the first study provided statistical power estimates for the design of the second focussed experiment which made a within group (twenty four subjects) comparison of the impact of spatial versus verbal tasks on balancing on the hardest beam. The spatial task significantly elevated the incidence of falls whereas the verbal task had no effect on fall rate. The spatial task raised the incidence of falling by 50% (P = 0.0008) in comparison with 'no task'. The verbal task had no effect (P = 0.07). We conclude that sway magnitude is a poor index of multi-task load. Multi-tasking can increase the chance of falling and spatial processing may have a specific impact on balance. The significant elevation of fall frequency during cognitive tasking shows that the 'posture first' principal can be transgressed although the necessary condition for transgression may be that the subject is willing to take risks believing that he can arrest any fall. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Attention; Balance; Dual tasking; Falls","adult; article; attention; body equilibrium; cognition; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; depth perception; falling; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; mental function; normal human; pressure measurement; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; task performance; Accidental Falls; Adult; Attention; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Musculoskeletal Equilibrium; Postural Balance; Psychomotor Performance; Space Perception; Task Performance and Analysis; Verbal Behavior",,,,,,"Adkin, A.L., Frank, J.S., Carpenter, M.G., Peysar, G.W., Postural control is scaled to level of postural threat (2000) Gait Posture, 12, pp. 87-93; Andersson, G., Yardley, L., Luxon, L., A dual-task study of interference between mental activity and control of balance (1998) Am J Otol, 19, pp. 632-637; Andersson, G., Hagman, J., Talianzadeh, R., Svedberg, A., Larsen, H.C., Effect of cognitive load on postural control (2002) Brain Res Bull, 58, pp. 135-139; Andersson, G., Hagman, J., Talianzadeh, R., Svedberg, A., Larsen, H.C., Dual-task study of cognitive and postural interference in patients with vestibular disorders (2003) Otol Neurotol, 24, pp. 289-293; Ashburn, A., Stack, E., Fallers and non-fallers with Parkinson's disease (PD): The influence of a dual task on standing balance (2000) Mov Disord, 15; Bloem, B.R., Valkenburg, V.V., Slabbekoorn, M., Van Dijk, J.G., The multiple tasks test.

Methods: Thirty-two patients (26 males; aged 69 to 83 years) from three centers (two in Europe, one in Australia) were selected for endoluminal stent-grafting using predilated 8mm PTFE graft material fitted with extra-large Palmaz stents at the terminal ends. Aortoaortic tube grafts were implanted in 12 patients, while the remainder received aortomonoiliac endografts and femorofemoral bypass. Follow-up at 5 days and then biannually was by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or duplex scanning. Results: There were 13 conversions to open surgery; three patients died within 30 days. Nineteen patients were discharged with functioning endografts within 5 days of treatment. Of these, two have had their grafts removed owing to infection in one and distal stent migration in the other. Two endoleaks have been detected in follow-up; one has been sealed by covered stenting. One twisted graft was repaired by Wallstent implantation. Seventeen patients remain well, one with persistent distal endoleak, but none shows an increase in AAA diameter on imaging over the 6- to 26-month (median 13) follow-up. Conclusions: These results represent the learning curves of three separate centers. Technical failure end complications were more common early in the study. Advantages of the technique include relative low cost and the ability to tailor the stent- graft to the individual aneurysm.","Endografts; Endovascular repair; Palmaz stents; Stent-grafts","politef; abdominal aorta aneurysm; aged; aneurysm surgery; artery graft; article; clinical article; contrast enhancement; endovascular surgery; female; follow up; human; male; priority journal; spiral computer assisted tomography; stent; vascular surgery; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Feasibility Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Retrospective Studies; Stents; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex",,"Polytetrafluoroethylene, 9002-84-0",,,,,"Adiseshiah, M.; University College London Hospitals, 25 Grafton Way, London WC1E 6AU, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,10746218,,JESUF,9291055,"English","J.
