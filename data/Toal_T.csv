Secondary cell walls, such as those found in xylem, are composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin and account for the bulk of plant biomass. The coordination between transcriptional regulation of synthesis for each polymer is complex and vital to cell function. A regulatory hierarchy of developmental switches has been proposed, although the full complement of regulators remains unknown. Here we present a protein-DNA network between Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factors and secondary cell wall metabolic genes with gene expression regulated by a series of feed-forward loops. This model allowed us to develop and validate new hypotheses about secondary wall gene regulation under abiotic stress. Distinct stresses are able to perturb targeted genes to potentially promote functional adaptation. These interactions will serve as a foundation for understanding the regulation of a complex, integral plant component.",,"cellulose; glutathione transferase; green fluorescent protein; hemicellulose; lignin; protein; transcription factor; abiotic stress; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; biosynthesis; cell wall; chromatin immunoprecipitation; confocal laser microscopy; controlled study; DNA protein complex; endoreduplication; gel mobility shift assay; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene regulatory network; immunoprecipitation; nonhuman; plant cell; plant growth; priority journal; promoter region; protein DNA interaction; protein interaction; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; salinity; salt stress; transient expression; xylem cell",,"cellulose, 61991-22-8, 68073-05-2, 9004-34-6; glutathione transferase, 50812-37-8; hemicellulose, 63100-39-0, 63100-40-3, 9034-32-6; lignin, 9005-53-2; protein, 67254-75-5",,,,"Brown, D.M., Zeef, L.A.H., Ellis, J., Goodacre, R., Turner, S.R., Identification of novel genes in Arabidopsis involved in secondary cell wall formation using expression profiling and reverse genetics (2005) Plant Cell, 17, pp. 2281-2295; Persson, S., Wei, H., Milne, J., Page, G.P., Somerville, C.R., Identification of genes required for cellulose synthesis by regression analysis of public microarray data sets (2005) Proc.

Smith Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, Israel","The plant vascular system serves as a conduit for delivery of both nutrients and signaling molecules to various distantly located organs. The anucleate sieve tube system of the angiosperm phloem delivers sugars and amino acids to developing organs, and has recently been shown to contain a unique population of RNA and proteins. Grafting studies have established that a number of these macromolecules are capable of moving long distances between tissues, thus providing support for operation of a phloem-mediated inter-organ communication network. Currently, our knowledge of the roles played by such phloem-borne macromolecules is in its infancy. Here, we show that, in tomato, translocation of a phloem-mobile cyclophilin, SlCyp1, from a wild-type scion into a mutant rootstock results in restoration of vascular development and lateral root initiation. This process occurs through reactivation of auxin response pathways and reprogramming of the root transcriptome. Moreover, we show that long-distance trafficking of SlCyp1 is associated with regulation of the shoot-to-root ratio in response to changing light intensities, by modulating root growth. We conclude that long-distance trafficking of SlCyp1 acts as a rheostat to control the shoot-to-root ratio, by mediating root development to integrate photosynthesis and light intensity with requirements for access to water and mineral nutrients. Significance Statement Plants must coordinate metabolism and growth of their organs to develop under changing environmental conditions. Here we show that a phloem cyclophilin, SlCyp1, accumulates in leaves as a function of light intensity and trafficks from shoot to root, resulting in major transcriptional changesrelated to auxin responses, and thus increased lateral root development. We propose that SlCyp1 acts as a rheostat that integrates leaf photosynthetic capacity with root growth under varying environmental conditions. © 2015 The Authors. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","auxin; cyclophilin; diageotropica; phloem; root development; shoot-to-root ratio; Solanum lycopersicum","Cardiovascular system; Fruits; Macromolecules; Nutrients; Proteins; auxin; Cyclophilin; diageotropica; phloem; Root development; Shoot to root ratios; Solanum lycopersicum; Plants (botany); Lycopersicon esculentum; Magnoliophyta","GENBANK: AEK75338, AER58181, AF034545, AF097310:AF097311, BAB12440:BAB12441, BAF61135, BAL41682, FN689857:FN689859, LN626749",,,,,"Balbi, V., Lomax, T.L., Regulation of early tomato fruit development by the diageotropica gene (2003) Plant Physiol., 131, pp. 186-197; Barg, R., Pilowsky, M., Shabtai, S., Carmi, N., Alejandro, D., Szechtman, B.D., Salts, Y., The TYLCV-tolerance tomato line MP-1 is characterized by superior transformation competence (1997) J.

We have characterized the root development of a wild and a domesticated tomato species, Solanum pennellii and Solanum lycopersicum 'M82.' We found extensive differences between these species for root morphology and cellular development including root length, a novel gravity set point angle, differences in cortical cell layer patterning, stem cell niche structure, and radial cell division. Using an introgression line population between these two species, we identified numerous loci that regulate these distinct aspects of development. Specifically we comprehensively identified loci that regulate (1) root length by distinct mechanisms including regulation of cell production within the meristem and the balance between cell division and expansion, (2) the gravity set point angle, and (3) radial cell division or expansion either in specific cell types or generally across multiple cell types. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the regulation of root growth and development between species. These loci have exciting implications with respect to regulation of drought resistance or salinity tolerance and regulation of root development in a family that has undergone domestication. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

However, metabolomics studies on multicellular organisms have thus far been performed primarily on whole organisms, organs, or cell lines, losing information about individual cell types within a tissue. With the goal of profiling metabolite content in different cell populations within an organ, we used FACS to dissect GFP-marked cells from Arabidopsis roots for metabolomics analysis. Here, we present the metabolic profiles obtained from five GFP-tagged lines representing core cell types in the root. Fifty metabolites were putatively identified, with the most prominent groups being glucosinolates, phenylpropanoids, and dipeptides, the latter of which is not yet explored in roots. The mRNA expression of enzymes or regulators in the corresponding biosynthetic pathways was compared with the relative metabolite abundance. Positive correlations suggest that the rate-limiting steps in biosynthesis of glucosinolates in the root are oxidative modifications of side chains. The current study presents a work flow for metabolomics analyses of cell-type populations. © PNAS 2013.",,"messenger RNA; Arabidopsis; article; cell differentiation; cell isolation; cell population; cell type; clinical assessment; endodermis; epidermis; gene expression; mass spectrometry; metabolism; multicellular spheroid; nonhuman; plant root; priority journal; ultra performance liquid chromatography; Arabidopsis; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Metabolome; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Arabidopsis",,"RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant",,,,"Wang, D., Bodovitz, S., Single cell analysis: The new frontier in 'omics' (2010) Trends Biotechnol, 28 (6), pp. 281-290; Kalisky, T., Quake, S.R., Single-cell genomics (2011) Nat Methods, 8 (4), pp. 311-314; Yonekura-Sakakibara, K., Saito, K., Functional genomics for plant natural product biosynthesis (2009) Nat Prod Rep, 26 (11), pp. 1466-1487; Heinemann, M., Zenobi, R., Single cell metabolomics (2011) Curr Opin Biotechnol, 22 (1), pp. 26-31; Hölscher, D., Schneider, B., Laser microdissection and cryogenic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: An alliance for cell type-specific metabolite profiling (2007) Planta, 225 (3), pp. 763-770; Amantonico, A., Urban, P.L., Fagerer, S.R., Balabin, R.M., Zenobi, R., Single-cell MALDIMS as an analytical tool for studying intrapopulation metabolic heterogeneity of unicellular organisms (2010) Anal Chem, 82 (17), pp. 7394-7400; Stitt, M., Heldt, H.W., Generation and maintenance of concentration gradients between the mesophyll and bundle sheath in maize leaves (1985) Biochim Biophys Acta, 808 (3), pp. 400-414; Birnbaum, K., A gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root (2003) Science, 302 (5652), pp. 1956-1960; Brady, S.M., A high-resolution root spatiotemporal map reveals dominant expression patterns (2007) Science, 318 (5851), pp. 801-806; Yadav, R.K., Girke, T., Pasala, S., Xie, M., Reddy, G.V., Gene expression map of the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem stem cell niche (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106 (12), pp. 4941-4946; Petersson, S.V., An auxin gradient and maximum in the Arabidopsis root apex shown by high-resolution cell-specific analysis of IAA distribution and synthesis (2009) Plant Cell, 21 (6), pp. 1659-1668; Birnbaum, K., Cell type-specific expression profiling in plants via cell sorting of protoplasts from fluorescent reporter lines (2005) Nat Methods, 2 (8), pp. 615-619; De Vos, R.C., Untargeted large-scale plant metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (2007) Nat Protoc, 2 (4), pp. 778-791; Adato, A., Fruit-surface flavonoid accumulation in tomato is controlled by a SlMYB12-regulated transcriptional network (2009) PLoS Genet, 5 (12), pp. e1000777; Levesque, M.P., Whole-genome analysis of the SHORT-ROOT developmental pathway in Arabidopsis (2006) PLoS Biol, 4 (5), pp. e143; Smith, C.A., Want, E.J., O'Maille, G., Abagyan, R., Siuzdak, G., XCMS: Processing mass spectrometry data for metabolite profiling using nonlinear peak alignment, matching, and identification (2006) Anal Chem, 78 (3), pp. 779-787; Gu, Q., Evaluation of automated sample preparation, retention time locked gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and data analysis methods for the metabolomic study of Arabidopsis species (2011) J Chromatogr A, 1218 (21), pp. 3247-3254; Brodsky, L., Moussaieff, A., Shahaf, N., Aharoni, A., Rogachev, I., Evaluation of peak picking quality in LC-MS metabolomics data (2010) Anal Chem, 82 (22), pp. 9177-9187; Rogachev, I., Aharoni, A., UPLC-MS-based metabolite analysis in tomato (2012) Methods Mol Biol, 860, pp. 129-144; Brown, P.D., Tokuhisa, J.G., Reichelt, M., Gershenzon, J., Variation of glucosinolate accumulation among different organs and developmental stages of Arabidopsis thaliana (2003) Phytochemistry, 62 (3), pp. 471-481; Kliebenstein, D.J., Characterization of seed-specific benzoyloxyglucosinolate mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana (2007) Plant J, 51 (6), pp. 1062-1076; Rogers, E.D., Jackson, T., Moussaieff, A., Aharoni, A., Benfey, P.N., Cell type-specific transcriptional profiling: Implications for metabolite profiling (2012) Plant J, 70 (1), pp. 5-17; Ernst, J., Mapping and analysis of chromatin state dynamics in nine human cell types (2011) Nature, 473 (7345), pp. 43-49; Kliebenstein, D.J., Kroymann, J., Mitchell-Olds, T., The glucosinolate-myrosinase system in an ecological and evolutionary context (2005) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 8 (3), pp. 264-271; Komarova, N.Y., AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 transport dipeptides in planta (2008) Plant Physiol, 148 (2), pp. 856-869; Ludwig-Müller, J., Indole glucosinolate and auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
