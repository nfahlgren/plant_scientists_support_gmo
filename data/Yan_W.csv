Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain size have been cloned in the past 10 yr. To explore the natural variation in these QTLs, resequencing of grain width and weight 2 (GW2), grain size 5 (GS5) and QTL for seed width 5 (qSW5) and genotyping of grain size 3 (GS3) were performed in the germplasms of 127 varieties of rice (O. sativa) and 10-15 samples of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon). Ten, 10 and 15 haplotypes were observed for GW2, GS5 and qSW5. qSW5 and GS3 had the strongest effects on grain size, which have been widely utilized in rice production, whereas GW2 and GS5 showed more modest effects. GS5 showed small sequence variations in O. sativa germplasm and that of its progenitor O. rufipogon. qSW5 exhibited the highest level of nucleotide diversity. GW2 showed signs of purifying selection. The four grain size genes experienced different selection intensities depending on their genetic effects. In the indica population, linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected among GS3, qSW5 and GS5. The substantial genetic variation in these four genes provides the flexibility needed to design various rice grain shapes. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary features of grain size genes in rice. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.","Grain size genes; Linkage disequilibrium; Nucleotide diversity; Phenotypic variation; Resequencing; Rice","cultivation; gene; genetic variation; germplasm; phenotypic plasticity; rice; Oryza; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; Zizania; nucleotide; allele; article; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; grain size genes; haplotype; histology; inbreeding; nucleotide diversity; phenotype; phenotypic variation; phylogeny; plant gene; plant seed; quantitative trait locus; resequencing; rice; grain size genes; linkage disequilibrium; nucleotide diversity; phenotypic variation; resequencing; rice; Alleles; Genes, Plant; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Inbreeding; Linkage Disequilibrium; Nucleotides; Oryza sativa; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Quantitative Trait Loci; Seeds; Selection, Genetic",,,,,,"Bai, X., Luo, L., Yan, W., Kovi, M.R., Zhan, W., Xing, Y., Genetic dissection of rice grain shape using a recombinant inbred line population derived from two contrasting parents and fine mapping a pleiotropic quantitative trait locus qGL7 (2010) BMC Genetics, 11, p. 16; Bradbury, P.J., Zhang, Z., Kroon, D.E., Casstevens, T.M., Ramdoss, Y., Buckler, E.S., TASSEL: software for association mapping of complex traits in diverse samples (2007) Bioinformatics, 23, pp. 2633-2635; Caicedo, A.L., Williamson, S.H., Hernandez, R.D., Boyko, A., Fledel-Alon, A., York, T.L., Polato, N.R., McCouch, S.R., Genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism in domesticated rice (2007) PLoS Genetics, 3, pp. 1745-1756; Chou, S.L., China is the place of origin of rice (1948) Journal of the Rice Society of China, 7, pp. 53-54; Fan, C., Xing, Y., Mao, H., Lu, T., Han, B., Xu, C., Li, X., Zhang, Q., GS3, a major QTL for grain length and weight and minor QTL for grain width and thickness in rice, encodes a putative transmembrane protein (2006) TAG.

These traits are controlled by their genetic constitution, and environmental factors including light, temperature, fertilizers, and biotic stress. With completion of the rice genome sequence, dissection of the genetic basis of yield traits as well as rice quality advanced substantially. Hundreds of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these traits were identified on the basis of molecular linkage maps. Dozens of disease and insect resistant QTL/genes were identified as well. Numerous markers linked to major QTL were anchored in the process of fine mapping. Map-based cloning of QTL isolated dozens of genes controlling yield components, rice quality, and biotic stress tolerance. Functional markers were developed based on these functional genes. These linked markers and functional markers started to play important roles in developing rice varieties with higher quality, higher yield potential, and greater yield stability. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Flag leaf contributed the majority of photosynthate after rice flowering. Ghd7 is a pleiotropic gene, which can significantly increase rice production. In order to study the genetic effects of Ghd7 on the flag leaf morphology, we made quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for flag leaf length (FLL), flag leaf width (FLW), and flag leaf area (FLA) using a Ghd7-BC2F2 population of 190 plants. In the BC2F2 population, the frequency distribution of FLL, FLW, and FLA were bimodal and in agreement with single Mendelian segregation ratio (3:1). FLL, FLW, and FLA were positively correlated with grains per panicle in the population. One QTL was mapped to the in-terval between markers RM3859 and C39 on chromosome 7, which explained 73.3%, 62.3%, and 71.8% of the variations for FLL, FLW, and FLA, and co-segregated with Ghd7. Two near-isogenic lines of NIL (mh7) and NIL (tq7) were devel-oped using Zhenshan 97 as the recurrent parent and Minghui 63 and Teqing as the donor parent, respectively. Both NILs significantly increased the phenotypic values of FLL, FLW, and FLA as compared with Zhenshan 97. FLL, The values of FLW and FLA for Ghd7 over-expression transgenic plants were 8.9 cm, 0.5 cm, and 17.8 cm2 larger than its recipient Heji-ang 19. These results demonstrated that Ghd7 plays an important role in controlling the flag leaf area in rice.",,"article; chromosome map; genetics; genotype; phenotype; plant chromosome; plant gene; plant leaf; pleiotropy; quantitative trait locus; rice; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genotype; Oryza sativa; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Quantitative Trait Loci",,,,,,,"Tan, C.email: tancong_2012@126.com",,,,,,,,02539772,,,22805217,"Chinese","Yi Chuan",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871910633

Ghd7 is a pleiotropic gene that controls the aforementioned traits simultaneously. In this study, a rice germplasm collection of 104 accessions (Oryza sativa) and 3 wild rice varieties (O.rufipogon) was used to analyze the evolution and association of Ghd7 with plant height, heading date, and yield. Among the 104 accessions, 76 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and six insertions and deletions were found within a 3932-bp DNA fragment of Ghd7. A higher pairwise π and θ in the promoter indicated a highly diversified promoter of Ghd7. Sixteen haplotypes and 8 types of Ghd7 protein were detected. SNP changes between haplotypes indicated that Ghd7 evolved from two distinct ancestral gene pools, and independent domestication processes were detected in indica and japonica varietals respectively. In addition to the previously reported premature stop mutation in the first exon of Ghd7, which caused phenotypic changes of multiple traits, we found another functional C/T mutation (SNP S_555) by structure-based association analysis. SNP S_555 is located in the promoter and was related to plant height probably by altering gene expression. Moreover, another seven SNP mutations in complete linkage were found to be associated with the number of spikelets per panicle, regardless of the photoperiod. These associations provide the potential for flexibility of Ghd7 application in rice breeding programs. © 2012 Lu et al.",,"DNA fragment; genomic DNA; protein Ghd7; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; vegetable protein; agricultural parameters; article; evolution; exon; gene expression regulation; gene location; gene pool; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic improvement; genetic linkage; genetic variability; germplasm; Ghd7 gene; haplotype; heading date; indel mutation; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; photoperiodicity; plant breeding; plant gene; plant height; plant leaf; plant yield; pleiotropy; promoter region; rice; single nucleotide polymorphism; spikelet; varietas; wild type; breeding; cytology; flower; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetics; growth, development and aging; histology; metabolism; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; point mutation; species difference; stop codon; Japonica; Oryza sativa; Zizania; Base Sequence; Breeding; Codon, Terminator; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germ Cells, Plant; Haplotypes; Linkage Disequilibrium; Molecular Sequence Data; Oryza sativa; Phenotype; Plant Proteins; Point Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Species Specificity","GENBANK: JF926532, JF926533, JF926534, JF926535, JF926536, JF926537, JF926538, JF926539, JF926540, JF926541, JF926542, JF926543","Codon, Terminator; Plant Proteins",,,,"Zong, Y., Chen, Z., Innes, J.B., Chen, C., Wang, Z., Fire and flood management of coastal swamp enabled first rice paddy cultivation in east China (2007) Nature, 449, pp. 459-462; Zhao, Z., The Middle Yangtze region in China is one place where rice was domesticated: phytolith evidence from the Diaotonghuan Cave, Northern Jiangxi (1998) Antiquity, 72, pp. 885-897; Zhang, Q., Genetic diversity and differentiation of indica and japonica rice detected by RFLP analysis (1992) Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 83, pp. 495-499; Londo, J.P., Chiang, Y.C., Hung, K.H., Chiang, T.Y., Schaal, B.A., Phylogeography of Asian wild rice, Oryza rufipogon, reveals multiple independent domestications of cultivated rice, Oryza sativa (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 103, pp. 9578-9583; Kovach, M.J., Sweeney, M.T., McCouch, S.R., New insights into the history of rice domestication (2007) Trends Genet, 23, pp. 578-587; Garris, A.J., Tai, T.H., Coburn, J., Kresovich, S., McCouch, S., Genetic structure and diversity in Oryza sativa L.

Heading date and plant height also greatly influence the yield. Dissection of genetic bases of yield-related traits would provide tools for yield improvement. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for spikelets per panicle, thousand-grain weight, heading date and plant height was performed using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two diverse cultivars, Nanyangzhan and Chuan7. In total, 20 QTLs were identified for four traits. They were located to 11 chromosomes except on chromosome 4. Seven and five QTLs were detected for thousand-grain weight and spikelets per panicle, respectively. Four QTLs were identified for both heading date and plant height. About half the QTLs were commonly detected in both years, 2006 and 2007. Six QTLs are being reported for the first time. Two QTL clusters were identified in regions flanked by RM22065 and RM5720 on chromosome 7 and by RM502 and RM264 on chromosome 8, respectively. The parent, Nanyangzhan with heavy thousand-grain weight, carried alleles with increased effects on all seven thousand-grain weight QTL, which explained why there was no transgressive segregation for thousand-grain weight in the population. In contrast, Chuan7 with more spikelets per panicle carried positive alleles at all five spikelets per panicle QTL except qspp5. Further work on distinction between pleiotropic QTL and linked QTL is needed in two yield-related QTL clusters. © 2011 Indian Academy of Sciences.","correlation; QTL cluster; rice; yield","article; chromosome map; crop; genetic association; genetic enhancement; genetic linkage; genetics; growth, development and aging; heredity; inbreeding; phenotype; plant chromosome; plant physiology; quantitative trait locus; rice; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Crops, Agricultural; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Enhancement; Heredity; Inbreeding; Lod Score; Oryza sativa; Phenotype; Plant Physiological Processes; Quantitative Trait Loci",,,,,,"Ashikari, M., Sakakibara, H., Lin, S.Y., Yamamoto, T., Takashi, T., Nishimura, A., Cytokinin oxidase regulates rice grain production (2005) Science, 309, pp. 741-745; Bai, X.F., Luo, L.J., Yan, W.H., Kovi, M.R., Zhan, W., Xing, Y.Z., Genetic dissection of rice grain shape using a recombinant inbred line population derived from two very contrasting parents and fine mapping a pleiotropic quantitative trait locus qGL7 (2010) BMC Genet., 11, p. 16; Cho, Y.G., Blair, M.W., Panaud, O., McCouch, S.R., Cloning and mapping of variety-specific rice genomic DNA sequences: amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) from silver stained polyacrylamide gels (1996) Genome, 39, pp. 373-378; Cho, Y.C., Suh, J.P., Choi, I.S., Hong, H.C., Baek, M.K., Kang, K.H., QTLs analysis of yield and its related trait in wild rice relative Oryza rufipogon (2003) Treat.

The application of semi-dwarf 1 led to the green revolution in the 1960s, by predominantly increasing the rice yield. However, the frequent use of single sd1 gene sources may cause genetic vulnerability to pests and diseases. Identifying useful novel semi-dwarf genes is important for the genetic manipulation of plant architecture in practical rice breeding. In this study, introgression lines derived from two parents contrasting in plant height, Zhenshan 97 and Pokkali were employed to locate a gene with a large effect on plant height by the bulk segregant analysis method. A major gene, ph1, was mapped to a region closely linked to sd1 on chromosome 1; the additive effects of ph1 were more than 50 cm on the plant height and 2 days on the heading date in a BC 4F 2 population and its progeny. ph1 was then fine mapped to BAC AP003227. Gene annotation indicated that LOC_OS01g65990 encoding a chitin-inducible gibberellin-responsive protein (CIGR), which belongs to the GRAS family, might be the right candidate gene of ph1. Co-segregation analysis of the candidate gene-derived marker finally confirmed its identity as the candidate gene. A higher expression level of the CIGR was detected in all the tested tissues in tall plants compared to those of short plants, especially in the young leaf sheath containing elongating tissues, which indicated its importance role in regulating plant height. ph1 showed a tremendous genetic effect on plant height, which is distinct from sd1 and could be a new resource for breeding semi-dwarf varieties. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",,"Additive effects;

The dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying rice yield traits is important for developing high-yielding rice varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Ghd8, a major QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date, and plant height. Two sets of near isogenic line populations were developed for the cloning of Ghd8. Ghd8 was narrowed down to a 20-kb region containing two putative genes, of which one encodes the OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT-box binding protein (HAP complex); this gene was regarded as the Ghd8 candidate. A complementary test confirmed the identity and pleiotropic effects of the gene; interestingly, the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on its genetic background. By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions. Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant. The ectopic expression of Ghd8 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering by 10d - a situation similar to the one observed by its homolog AtHAP3b, when compared to wild-type under long-day conditions; these findings indicate the conserved function of Ghd8 and AtHAP3b in flowering in Arabidopsis. Our results demonstrated the important roles of Ghd8 in rice yield formation and flowering, as well as its opposite functions in flowering between rice and Arabidopsis under long-day conditions. © 2010 The Author.

Determining the genetic basis of variations in grain shape could facilitate efficient improvements in grain appearance. In this study, an F7:8recombinant inbred line population (RIL) derived from a cross between indica and japonica cultivars (Nanyangzhan and Chuan7) contrasting in grain size was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. A genetic linkage map was constructed with 164 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The major aim of this study was to detect a QTL for grain shape and to fine map a minor QTL, qGL7.Results: Four QTLs for GL were detected on chromosomes 3 and 7, and 10 QTLs for GW and 9 QTLs for GT were identified on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10, respectively. A total of 28 QTLs were identified, of which several are reported for the first time; four major QTLs and six minor QTLs for grain shape were also commonly detected in both years. The minor QTL, qGL7, exhibited pleiotropic effects on GL, GW, GT, 1000-grain weight (TGW), and spikelets per panicle (SPP) and was further validated in a near isogenic F2population (NIL-F2). Finally, qGL7 was narrowed down to an interval between InDel marker RID711 and SSR marker RM6389, covering a 258-kb region in the Nipponbare genome, and cosegregated with InDel markers RID710 and RID76.Conclusion: Materials with very different phenotypes were used to develop mapping populations to detect QTLs because of their complex genetic background. Progeny tests proved that the minor QTL, qGL7, could display a single mendelian characteristic. Therefore, we suggested that minor QTLs for traits with high heritability could be isolated using a map-based cloning strategy in a large NIL-F2population. In addition, combinations of different QTLs produced diverse grain shapes, which provide the ability to breed more varieties of rice to satisfy consumer preferences. © 2010 Bai et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; chromosome 10; chromosome 2; chromosome 3; chromosome 5; chromosome 7; chromosome 9; controlled study; correlational study; cross breeding; cultivar; gene interaction; genetic analysis; genetic linkage; grain (structure); heritability; nonhuman; phenotype; pleiotropy; quantitative trait locus; quantitative trait locus mapping; recombinant inbred strain; rice; simple sequence repeat; thickness; validation study; chromosome map; DNA sequence; genetics; plant chromosome; plant seed; population genetics; quantitative trait locus; rice; Japonica; microsatellite DNA; plant DNA; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; DNA, Plant; Genetics, Population; Linkage (Genetics); Microsatellite Repeats; Oryza sativa; Quantitative Trait Loci; Seeds; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"DNA, Plant",,,,"Unnevehr, L.J., Duff, B., Juliano, B.O., Consumer demand for rice grain quality (1992), International Rice Research Institute, Manila, The Philippines/International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, CanadaWan, X.Y., Wan, J.M., Jiang, L., Wang, J.K., Zhai, H.Q., Weng, J.F., Wang, H.L., Guo, X.P., QTL analysis for rice grain length and fine mapping of an identified QTL with stable and major effects (2006) Theor Appl Genet, 112, pp. 1258-1270. , 10.1007/s00122-006-0227-0, 16477428; Juliano, B.O., Villareal, Grain quality evaluation of world rices (1993), International Rice Research Institute.
