Drought-deciduousness, which reduces water loss, and low wood density, which may permit dependence on stored water, are considered key traits. For saplings of six species at two distinct sites, we studied these and two associated traits: the seasonal amount of water released per stem volume (“water released”) and the hydraulic capacitance of the stem (C). Two deciduous species with low stem density, Cavanillesia platanifolia and Burserasimaruba, had high C and high dry-season stem water potential (Ψstem), but differed in dry-season water released. C. platanifolia did not use stored water during the dry season whereas B. simaruba, in a drier forest, released stored water. In both, water released was highest while flushing leaves, suggesting that stored water supports leaf flushing. In contrast, two deciduous species with intermediate stem density, Annona hayesii and Genipa americana, had intermediate C, low dry-season Ψstem, and high seasonal change in water released. Meanwhile, two evergreen species with intermediate stem density, Cojoba rufescens and Astronium graveolens, had relatively low C, low dry-season Ψstem, and intermediate seasonal change in water released. Thus, at least three, distinct stored-water-use strategies were observed. Additionally, bark relative water content (RWC) decreased along with Ψstem during the dry season while xylem RWC did not change, suggesting that bark-stored water buffers Ψstem seasonally. Together these results suggest that seasonal use of stored water and change in Ψstem are associated with functional groups that are characterized by combinations of deciduousness and stem density. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Capacitance; Drought; Functional groups; Leaf phenology; Tree physiology","Annona; Astronium graveolens; Cavanillesia platanifolia; Cojoba; Genipa americana",,,,,"DEB-0444590, NSF, National Science Foundation","Aide, T.M., Herbivory as a selective agent on the timing of leaf production in a tropical understory community (1988) Nature, 336, pp. 574-575; Baldeck, C.A., Harms, K.E., Yavitt, J.B., John, R., Turner, B.L., Valencia, R., Navarrete, H., Yaacob, A., Habitat filtering across tree life stages in tropical forest communities (2013) Proc R Soc B, 280, p. 20130548. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC3sbltl2hsA%3D%3D; Barnard, D.M., Meinzer, F.C., Lachenbruch, B., McCulloh, K.A., Johnson, D.M., Woodruff, D.R., Climate-related trends in sapwood biophysical properties in two conifers: avoidance of hydraulic dysfunction through coordinated adjustments in xylem efficiency, safety and capacitance (2011) Plant Cell Environ, 34, pp. 643-654; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) J R Stat Soc B, 57, pp. 289-300; Borchert, R., Soil and stem water storage determine phenology and distribution of tropical dry forest trees (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1437-1449; Borchert, R., Water status and development of tropical trees during seasonal drought (1994) Trees Struct Funct, 8, pp. 115-125; Borchert, R., Rivera, G., Hagnauer, W., Modification of vegetative phenology in a tropical semi- deciduous forest by abnormal drought and rain (2002) Biotropica, 34, pp. 27-39; Brenes-Arguedas, T., Roddy, A.B., Coley, P.D., Kursar, T.A., Do differences in understory light contribute to species distributions along a tropical rainfall gradient?

In the field, we measured the growth of Cecropia glaziovii saplings and compared individuals that were naturally colonized by Azteca muelleri ants with uncolonized plants in different seasons (wet and dry). We also measured light availability as well as attributes that could be influenced by the presence of Azteca colonies, such as herbivory, leaf nutrients (total nitrogen and δ15N), and investments in defense (total phenolics and leaf mass per area). We found that colonized plants grew faster than uncolonized plants and experienced a lower level of herbivory in both the wet and dry seasons. Colonized plants had higher nitrogen content than uncolonized plants, although the δ15N, light environment, total phenolics and leaf mass per area, did not differ between colonized and uncolonized plants. Since colonized and uncolonized plants did not differ in the direct defenses that we evaluated, yet herbivory was lower in colonized plants, we conclude that biotic defenses were the most effective protection against herbivores in our system. This result supports the hypothesis that protection provided by ants is an important factor promoting plant growth. Since C. glaziovii is widely distributed among a variety of forests and ecotones, and since we demonstrated a strong relationship with their ant partners, this system can be useful for comparative studies of ant-plant interactions in different habitats. Also, given this study was carried out near the transition to the subtropics, these results help generalize the geographic distribution of this mutualism and may shed light on the persistence of the interactions in the face of climate change. © 2015 Oliveira et al.",,"nitrogen; nitrogen 15; phenol derivative; ant; Article; Azteca muelleri; biotic stress; Cecropia; Cecropia glaziovii; climate change; controlled study; ecotone; forest; geographic distribution; growth rate; habitat; herbivory; light; nonhuman; nutrient; organism colony; plant defense; plant growth; plant insect interaction; plant leaf; sapling; season; symbiosis; Azteca; Azteca muelleri; Cecropia; Formicidae",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrogen 15, 14390-96-6",,,"CAPES, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; DEB-0444590, NSF, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior","Heil, M., McKey, D., Protective ant-plant interactions as model systems in ecological and evolutionary research (2003) Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 34, pp. 425-453; Davidson, D.W., Cecropia and its biotic defenses (2005) Flora Neotropica Monograph, pp. 214-226. , Berg CC, Rosselli PF, editors.

Herbivorous insects are useful models for studying resource specialization, and the interaction between plants and herbivorous insects is one of the most common and consequential ecological associations on the planet. However, uncertainty persists regarding fundamental features of herbivore diet breadth, including its relationship to latitude and plant species richness. Here, we use a global dataset to investigate host range for over 7,500 insect herbivore species covering a wide taxonomic breadth and interacting with more than 2,000 species of plants in 165 families. We ask whether relatively specialized and generalized herbivores represent a dichotomy rather than a continuum from few to many host families and species attacked and whether diet breadth changes with increasing plant species richness toward the tropics. Across geographic regions and taxonomic subsets of the data, we find that the distribution of diet breadth is fit well by a discrete, truncated Pareto power law characterized by the predominance of specialized herbivores and a long, thin tail of more generalized species. Both the taxonomic and phylogenetic distributions of diet breadth shift globally with latitude, consistent with a higher frequency of specialized insects in tropical regions. We also find that more diverse lineages of plants support assemblages of relatively more specialized herbivores and that the global distribution of plant diversity contributes to but does not fully explain the latitudinal gradient in insect herbivore specialization.","Host range; Latitudinal gradient; Niche width; Pareto distribution; Specialization","angiosperm; Article; diet; diet breadth; geographic distribution; herbivore; insect; latitude; Lepidoptera; mathematical parameters; nonhuman; pareto distribution; phylogeny; priority journal; species richness; taxonomy; tropics; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Büchi, L., Vuilleumier, S., Coexistence of specialist and generalist species is shaped by dispersal and environmental factors (2014) Am Nat, 183 (5), pp. 612-624; Devictor, V., Julliard, R., Jiguet, F., Distribution of specialist and generalist species along spatial gradients of habitat disturbance and fragmentation (2008) Oikos, 117 (4), pp. 507-514; Mougi, A., Kondoh, M., Diversity of interaction types and ecological community stability (2012) Science, 337 (6092), pp. 349-351; Lever, J.J., Van Nes, E.H., Scheffer, M., Bascompte, J., The sudden collapse of pollinator communities (2014) Ecol Lett, 17 (3), pp. 350-359; Singer, M.S., Herbivore diet breadth mediates the cascading effects of carnivores in food webs (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 111 (26), pp. 9521-9526; Hardy, N.B., Otto, S.P., Specialization and generalization in the diversification of phytophagous insects: Tests of the musical chairs and oscillation hypotheses (2014) Proc Biol Sci, 281 (1795), p. 20132960; Devictor, V., Defining and measuring ecological specialization (2010) J Appl Ecol, 47 (1), pp. 15-25; Forister, M.L., Dyer, L.A., Singer, M.S., Stireman, J.O., III, Lill, J.T., Revisiting the evolution of ecological specialization, with emphasis on insect-plant interactions (2012) Ecology, 93 (5), pp. 981-991; Futuyma, D.J., Moreno, G., The evolution of ecological specialization (1988) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 19, pp. 207-233; Seastedt, T., Crossley, D., Jr., The influence of arthropods on ecosystems (1984) Bioscience, 34 (3), pp. 157-161; Jaenike, J., Host specialization in phytophagous insects (1990) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 21, pp. 243-273; Janzen, D.H., Herbivores and the number of tree species in tropical forests (1970) Am Nat, 104 (940), pp. 501-528; Erwin, T.L., Tropical forests: Their richness in Coleoptera and other arthropod species (1982) Coleopt Bull, 36 (1), pp. 74-75; Dyer, L.A., Tasty generalists and nasty specialists?

We hypothesize that herbivores may exert divergent selection on defences, such that closely related plant species will be more different in defensive than in non-defensive traits. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating two clades of closely related plant species coexisting at a single site in the Peruvian Amazon: Inga capitata Desv. and Inga heterophylla Willd. species complexes. We compared how these lineages differ in the suite of chemical, biotic, phenological and developmental defences as compared to non-defensive traits that are related to habitat use and resource acquisition. We also collected insect herbivores feeding on the plants. Our data show that sister lineages within both species complexes are more divergent in antiherbivore defences than in other non-defensive, functional traits. Moreover, the assemblages of herbivore communities are dissimilar between the populations of coexisting I. capitata lineages. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that for the I. capitata and I. heterophylla species complexes, interactions with their natural enemies may have played a significant role in their phenotypic divergence and potentially in their diversification and coexistence. It also suggests that defensive traits are evolutionary labile. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Inga; Herbivores; Peru; Plant defences; Plant-herbivore interactions; Trait divergence; Tropical rain forests","antiherbivore defense; cladistics; coexistence; habitat use; phenotypic plasticity; plant defense; plant-insect interaction; rainforest; resource selection; species complex; tropical forest; Peru; Capitata; Hexapoda; Inga",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.A., Fishbein, M., Phylogenetic escalation and decline of plant defense strategies (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 105, pp. 10057-10060; Agrawal, A.A., Salminen, J.P., Fishbein, M., Phylogenetic trends in phenolic metabolism of milkweeds (Asclepias): evidence for escalation (2009) Evolution, 63, pp. 663-673; Agrawal, A.A., Fishbeinc, M., Halitschke, R., Hastings, A.P., Rabosky, D.L., Rasmann, S., Evidence for adaptive radiation from a phylogenetic study of plant defenses (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 106, pp. 18067-18072; Agrawal, A.A., Hastings, A.P., Johnson, M.T., Maron, J.L., Salminen, J.P., Insect herbivores drive real-time ecological and evolutionary change in plant populations (2012) Science, 338, pp. 113-117; Aide, T.M., Herbivory as a selective agent on the timing of leaf production in a tropical understory community (1988) Nature, 336, pp. 574-575; Aide, T.M., Patterns of leaf development and herbivory in a tropical understory community (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 455-466; Aide, T., Londoño, E., The effects of rapid leaf expansion on the growth and survivorship of a lepidopteran herbivore (1989) Oikos, 55, pp. 66-70; Anacker, B.L., Strauss, S.Y., The geography and ecology of plant speciation: range overlap and niche divergence in sister species (2014) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 281, p. 20132980; Anderson, M.J., A new method for a non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (2001) Austral Ecology, 26, pp. 32-46; Batschelet, E., (1981) Circular Statistics in Biology, , Academic Press, London; Becerra, J.X., Insects on plants: macroevolutionary chemical trends in host use (1997) Science, 27, pp. 253-256; Becerra, J.X., Noge, K., Venable, D.L., Macroevolutionary chemical escalation in an ancient plant- herbivore arms race (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 106, pp. 18062-18066; Berenbaum, M.R., Feeny, P., Toxicity of angular furanocoumarins to swallowtail butterflies: escalation in a coevolutionary arms race?

In Panama, a rainfall gradient correlates with the spatial turnover of tree species. While strong evidence suggests that tree species common in the wetter forests are excluded from the drier forests by seasonal drought, the factor(s) excluding drought-tolerant species, common in the drier forests, from the wetter forests remain ambiguous. Here, we show that seedlings were significantly more likely to suffer pathogen-caused damage and mortality in the wetter forest. While seedlings of dry- and wet-forest species were equally likely to suffer pathogen attack, seedlings of dry-forest species were significantly more likely to die when attacked and tended to suffer more pathogen-caused mortality overall. Furthermore, seedlings of dry-forest species suffered pathogen-caused mortality in the forest in which they do not naturally occur and in which conspecific and/or congeneric adults are absent or rare, indicating that some pathogens are relatively widespread and/or are capable of damaging multiple host species. Synthesis. Elevated risk of pathogen-caused damage and mortality in the wetter forests and a greater impact to host fitness from pathogen attack for seedlings of dry-forest species suggest that pathogens may enhance regional forest diversity by contributing to changes in tree species composition via the exclusion of dry-forest tree species from the wetter forests. This study highlights a potentially widespread and under explored mechanism by which pathogens shape plant communities at the landscape scale. An understanding of how species' distributions are shaped by the interplay between abiotic and biotic factors is essential for conservation biology. A rainfall gradient across the Isthmus of Panama correlates with changes in tree species composition. We observed an elevated risk of pathogen-caused damage and mortality for seedlings in the wetter forests and a greater impact to host fitness from pathogen attack for seedlings of tree species common in the drier forests. These results suggest that pathogens contribute to the exclusion of dry-forest tree species from the wetter forests and highlight a potentially widespread mechanism by which pathogens may enhance regional forest diversity.

Grasses (Poaceae), which first arose and diversified in tropical forests, harbor diverse but little-studied endophytes in the lowland forests of Panama. We used sequence data for 402 isolates from two sampling years, 11 host species, and 55 microsites at Barro Colorado Island, Panama to investigate the influence of host and habitat (soil type, forest age) in shaping endophyte diversity and composition. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for host- or habitat specificity. Instead, endophytes demonstrated strong spatial structure consistent with dispersal limitation, with community similarity decaying markedly over a scale of hundreds of meters. Spatial structure that is independent of host species and habitat reveals remarkable heterogeneity of endophyte-host associations at small geographic scales and adds an important spatial component to extrapolative estimates of fungal diversity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.","Barro colorado island; Biodiversity; Community assembly; Fungal endophytes; Poaceae; Similarity; Tropical forest",,,,,,,"Arnold, A.E., (2002) Fungal Endophytes in Neotropical Trees: Abundance, Diversity, and Ecological Interactions, , Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson; Arnold, A.E., Understanding the diversity of foliar fungal endophytes: progress, challenges, and frontiers (2007) Fungal Biology Reviews, 21, pp. 51-66; Arnold, A.E., Engelbrecht, B.M.J., Fungal endophytes double minimum leaf conductance in seedlings of a tropical tree (2007) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 23, pp. 369-372; Arnold, A.E., Henk, D.A., Eells, R.A., Lutzoni, F., Vilgalys, R., Diversity and phylogenetic affinities of foliar fungal endophytes in loblolly pine inferred by culturing and environmental PCR (2007) Mycologia, 99, pp. 185-206; Arnold, A.E., Herre, E.A., Canopy cover and leaf age affect colonization by tropical fungal endophytes: ecological pattern and process in Theobroma cacao (Malvaceae) (2003) Mycologia, 95, pp. 388-398; Arnold, A.E., Lutzoni, F., Diversity and host range of foliar fungal endophytes: are tropical leaves biodiversity hotspots?

Cultivation on malt extract agar (MEA) followed by bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of the new polyketide integrasone B (1) and two known mycotoxins, sterigmatocystin (2) and secosterigmatocystin (3). Sterigmatocystin (2) was found to be the main antiparasitic compound in the fermentation extract of this fungus, possessing potent and selective antiparasitic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease, with an IC50 value of 0·13 μmol l-1.

Endophytes associated with leaves of tropical plants are an especially exciting and relatively untapped source of novel compounds. However, one major challenge in drug discovery lies in developing strategies to efficiently recover highly bioactive strains. As part of a 15-year drug discovery project, foliar endophytes were isolated from 3198 plant samples (51 orders, 105 families and at least 232 genera of angiosperms and ferns) collected in nine geographically distinct regions of Panama. Extracts from culture supernatants of >2700 isolates were tested for bioactivity (in vitro percent inhibition of growth, % IG) against a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and the causative agents of malaria, leishmaniasis, and Chagas' disease. Overall, 32.7% of endophyte isolates were highly active in at least one bioassay, including representatives of diverse fungal lineages, host lineages, and collection sites. Up to 17% of isolates tested per assay were highly active. Most bioactive strains were active in only one assay. Fungal lineages differed in the incidence and degree of bioactivity, as did fungi from particular plant taxa, and greater bioactivity was observed in endophytes isolated from plants in cloud forests vs. lowland forests. Our results suggest that using host taxonomy and forest type to tailor plant collections, and selecting endophytes from specific orders or families for cultivation, will markedly increase the efficiency and efficacy of discovering bioactive metabolites for particular pharmaceutical targets. © 2013 Higginbotham et al.",,"fungal extract; Amphisphaeriaceae; angiosperm; antineoplastic activity; antiprotozoal activity; article; Aspergillus; bioassay; biological activity; Botryosphaeriaceae; Camarops; cancer cell culture; Colletotrichum; controlled study; Daldinia; Diaporthe; drug determination; drug isolation; drug targeting; endophyte; fungus; fungus culture; fungus isolation; geographic origin; Glomerella; growth inhibition; human; human cell; IC 50; in vitro study; Leishmania donovani; Magnaporthaceae; Mycosphaerella; Mycosphaerellaceae; Nectriaceae; nonhuman; Ophioceras; organismal interaction; Panama; Parapleurotheciopsis; Penidiella; Phomopsis; Phyllachoraceae; plant fungus interaction; Plasmodium falciparum; taxonomy; Trichocomaceae; Trypanosoma cruzi; Valsaceae; Xylaria; Xylariaceae; Antimalarials; Antineoplastic Agents; Biological Assay; Cell Line, Tumor; Endophytes; Fungi; Humans; Plants; Plasmodium falciparum; Trypanocidal Agents; Trypanosoma cruzi",,,,,,"Global Health Observatory (GHO): Cancer mortality and morbidity [Online], , http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/mortality_morbidity/cancer/en/index.html, World Health Organization.

Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that the traits that result in performance trade-offs between habitats contribute to the turnover of woody species along a rainfall gradient in the Isthmus of Panama. We studied 24 plant species with contrasting distributions along this rainfall gradient. We measured 18 morphological and physiological traits, and three performance variables in seedlings planted in common garden experiments in two contrasting sites across the Isthmus. We found evidence for a trade-off suggesting that better survival during the dry season corresponded to a lower growth rate in the forest understorey. This trade-off correlated well with the distribution of the species along the rainfall gradient and was explained mostly by variation in photosynthetic capacity. While not all species fit into this trade-off, most dry-distribution species, which we had previously reported to have higher drought survival, were associated with higher stem hydraulic conductance and higher capacity for CO2 assimilation. Our interpretation is that this combination of traits may be associated mostly with desiccation avoidance (deep roots) or desiccation delay (deciduousness) rather than desiccation tolerance. Despite their higher photosynthetic capacity, these species had lower growth in the low-light understorey, probably because of higher maintenance costs (dark respiration rates). Wet-distribution species, on the other hand, had lower photosynthetic capacity and higher leaf area ratio. This strategy is typical of shade-tolerant species and may explain their higher growth rates in the low-light understorey. In conclusion, our results suggest that habitat associations along the rainfall gradient in the Isthmus of Panama may result in part from a trade-off between traits that are favourable to species that avoid or delay desiccation but that otherwise limit shade tolerance. This trade-off may limit the capacity of some dry-distribution species to colonize wet forests. © 2012 British Ecological Society.","Biomass allocation; Defence; Drought tolerance; Photosynthesis; Plasticity; Rainfall gradient; Shade tolerance; Trade-offs; Tropical forest","biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; desiccation; drought resistance; environmental gradient; growth rate; hypothesis testing; life history trait; light availability; phenotypic plasticity; photosynthesis; population distribution; rainfall; seasonality; shade tolerance; survival; trade-off; tropical forest; understory; Panama [Central America]",,,,,,"Alvarez-Clare, S., Kitajima, K., Physical defence traits enhance seedling survival of neotropical tree species (2007) Functional Ecology, 21, pp. 1044-1054; Baltzer, J.L., Thomas, S.C., Determinants of whole-plant light requirements in Bornean rain forest tree saplings (2007) Journal of Ecology, 95, pp. 1208-1221; Baltzer, J.L., Davies, S.J., Bunyavejchewin, S., Noor, N.S.M., The role of desiccation tolerance in determining tree species distributions along the Malay-Thai Peninsula (2008) Functional Ecology, 22, pp. 221-231; Bennett, J.M., Cortes, P.M., Errors in measuring water potentials of small samples resulting from water adsorption by thermocouple psychrometer chambers (1985) Plant Physiology, 79, pp. 184-188; Bonal, D., Born, C., Brechet, C., Coste, S., Marcon, E., Roggy, J.-C., Guehl, J.-M., The successional status of tropical rainforest tree species is associated with differences in leaf carbon isotope discrimination and functional traits (2007) Annals of Forest Science, 64, pp. 169-176; Bongers, F., Poorter, L., Van Rompaey, R.S.A.R., Parren, M.P.E., Distribution of twelve moist forest canopy tree species in Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire: response curves to a climatic gradient (1999) Journal of Vegetation Science, 10, pp. 371-382; Borchert, R., Soil and stem water storage determine phenology and distribution of tropical dry forest trees (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1437-1449; Brenes-Arguedas, T., Coley, P.D., Kursar, T.A., Pests versus drought as determinants of plant distribution along a tropical rainfall gradient (2009) Ecology, 90, pp. 1751-1761; Brenes-Arguedas, T., Ríos, M., Rivas-Torres, G., Blundo, C., Coley, P.D., Kursar, T.A., The effect of soil on the growth performance of tropical species with contrasting distributions (2008) Oikos, 117, pp. 1453-1460; Brenes-Arguedas, T., Roddy, A.B., Coley, P.D., Kursar, T.A., Do differences in understory light contribute to species distributions along a tropical rainfall gradient?

Thus, to understand the effects of herbivory on tropical plant fitness, it is necessary to understand how tropical young leaves survive the brief, but critical, period of susceptibility. In this study, we surveyed three species of Inga during young leaf expansion. Three classes of toxic secondary metabolites (phenolics, saponins, and tyrosine), extrafloral nectar production, leaf area, and extrafloral nectary area were measured at randomly assigned young leaf sizes. In addition, all defenses were compared for potential trade-offs during leaf expansion. No trade-offs among defenses were found, and the concentration of all defenses, except tyrosine, decreased during leaf expansion. We suggest that plants continued to increase phenolic and saponin content, but at a rate that resulted in decreasing concentrations. In contrast, tyrosine content per leaf steadily increased such that a constant concentration was maintained regardless of young leaf size. Nectar production remained constant during leaf expansion, but, because young leaf area increased by tenfold, the investment in extrafloral nectar per leaf area significantly decreased. In addition, nectary area did not change during leaf expansion and therefore the relative size of the nectary significantly decreased during young leaf expansion. These results support the predictions of the optimal defense hypothesis and demonstrate that the youngest leaves have the highest investment in multiple defenses, most likely because they have the highest nitrogen content and are most susceptible to a diversity of herbivores. © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Ant-plant mutualism; Defense chemistry; Extrafloral nectary; Optimal defense; Panama; Plant-herbivore interactions","chemical defense; dicotyledon; fitness; herbivore; herbivory; leaf; leaf area; mutualism; nectar; Neotropic Ecozone; nitrogen; phenolic compound; plant defense; plant-herbivore interaction; secondary metabolite; trade-off; tropical forest; Panama [Central America]",,,,,,"Agrell, J., Oleszek, W., Stochmal, A., Olsen, M., Anderson, P., Herbivore-induced responses in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) (2003) J.

Box 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama","Treefall gaps in tropical forests have a profound effect on plants growing in the understory, primarily due to increased light availability. In higher light, mature leaves typically have increased anti-herbivore defenses. However, since the majority of herbivory occurs while leaves are expanding, it is important to determine whether defense expression during the short period of leaf expansion is canalized (invariant) or plastic in response to variation in light. Therefore, we examined young leaves of Inga paraensis (Fabaceae) saplings growing along a light gradient in a terra-firme forest in Central Amazonia. We quantified leaf production and expansion time, dry mass of phenolics, saponins, and nitrogen, ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries, and leaf consumption. Over the entire light gradient, the number of leaves produced per flush increased by 50 % and the mass of phenolic compounds by 20 %, but no other traits changed. On average, 39 % of leaf area was consumed with no difference across the light gradient. Alone, none of the leaf traits was a significant predictor of leaf consumption, except for phenolics, which showed a positive relationship. Multiple regressions showed that leaf consumption was positively related to more leaves per flush and a higher concentration of phenolics in leaves. Unlike studies of mature leaves, young leaves of I. paraensis show low plasticity in defense traits across a light gradient, suggesting that leaf development is canalized. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Amazonia; Canalization; Phenolics; Saponins; Young leaves","phenol derivative; antiherbivore defense; canalization (biology); concentration (composition); herbivory; legume; light availability; maturation; Neotropical Region; phenolic compound; physiological response; plant-herbivore interaction; sapling; secondary metabolite; treefall; tropical forest; understory; animal; ant; article; Brazil; Fabaceae; herbivory; light; metabolism; phenotype; physiology; plant leaf; tree; Animals; Ants; Brazil; Fabaceae; Herbivory; Light; Phenols; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Trees; Amazonia; Fabaceae; Formicidae; Inga",,"Phenols",,,,"Aide, T.M., Patterns of leaf development and herbivory in a tropical understory community (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 455-466. , doi:10.2307/1939307; Aide, T.M., Londoño, E.C., The effects of rapid leaf expansion on the growth and survivorship of a lepidopteran herbivore (1989) Oikos, 55, pp. 66-70. , doi:10.2307/3565873; Baraza, E., Gómez, J.M., Hódar, J.A., Zamora, R., Herbivory has a greater impact in shade than in sun: response of Quercus pyrenaica seedlings to multifactorial environmental variation (2004) Can J Bot, 82, pp. 357-364. , doi:10.1139/B04-004; Bierregaard, R.O., Gascon, C., The biological dynamics of forest fragments project: the study site, experimental design, and research activity (2001) Lessons from Amazonia: The Ecology and Conservation of a Fragmented Forest, pp. 31-42. , R.

The structures of minor compounds in the extract were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis as 2-(2-butyl)-6-ethyl-3-hydroxy-6-methylcyclohex-2-ene-1,5-dione (4), 3-(2-butyl)-6-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2-methoxy-6-methyl-cyclohex-2-enone (5), and an isomer of 5 (6). To study the influence of the hydroxy groups on the anti-parasitic activity of cercosporin, compound 1 was acetylated to obtain derivative 2. The isolated compounds 1- 6 were tested in vitro to determine their anti-parasitic activity against the causal agents of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), leishmaniasis (Leishmania donovani), and Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi). Cytotoxicity and potential anticancer activity of these compounds were evaluated using mammalian Vero cells and MCF7 cancer cell lines, respectively.

Although water availability is clearly one factor determining species distribution, other environmental variables that covary with rainfall may contribute to distributions. One such variable is light availability in the understory, which decreases towards wetter forests due to differences in canopy density and phenology. We established common garden experiments in three sites along a rainfall gradient across the Isthmus of Panama in order to measure the differences in understory light availability, and to evaluate their influence on the performance of 24 shade-tolerant species with contrasting distributions. Within sites, the effect of understory light availability on species performance depended strongly on water availability. When water was not limiting, either naturally in the wetter site or through water supplementation in drier sites, seedling performance improved at higher light. In contrast, when water was limiting at the drier sites, seedling performance was reduced at higher light, presumably due to an increase in water stress that affected mostly wet-distribution species. Although wetter forest understories were on average darker, wet-distribution species were not more shade-tolerant than dry-distribution species. Instead, wet-distribution species had higher absolute growth rates and, when water was not limiting, were better able to take advantage of small increases in light than dry-distribution species. Our results suggest that in wet forests the ability to grow fast during temporary increases in light may be a key trait for successful recruitment. The slower growth rates of the dry-distribution species, possibly due to trade-offs associated with greater drought tolerance, may exclude these species from wetter forests. © 2010 The Author(s).","Drought tolerance; Panama; Shade tolerance; Tropical dry forest; Tropical wet forest","rain; canopy; community composition; drought; experimental study; forest ecosystem; growth rate; light availability; limiting factor; phenology; population distribution; rainfall; recruitment (population dynamics); seedling; shade tolerance; tropical forest; understory; water availability; water stress; adaptation; article; biodiversity; comparative study; growth, development and aging; light; plant; plant physiology; population density; population dynamics; radiation exposure; tropic climate; Adaptation, Physiological; Biodiversity; Light; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Rain; Tropical Climate; Isthmus of Panama; Panama [Central America]",,,,,,"Baillie, I., Elsenbeer, H., Barthold, F., Grimm, R., Stallard, R., (2007) Semi-detailed Soil Survey of Barro Colorado Island, , http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/bioinformatics/bci_soil_map/, Panama; Balderrama, S.I.V., Chazdon, R.L., Light-dependent seedling survival and growth of four tree species in Costa Rican second-growth rain forests (2005) J Trop Ecol, 21, pp. 383-395; Baltzer, J.L., Thomas, S.C., Determinants of whole-plant light requirements in Bornean rain forest tree saplings (2007) J Ecol, 95, pp. 1208-1221; Baltzer, J.L., Davies, S.J., Noor, N.S.M., Kassim, A.R., Lafrankie, J.V., Geographical distributions in tropical trees: can geographical range predict performance and habitat association in co-occurring tree species?

However grasses first arose in tropical forests, where they remain a significant and diverse component of understory and forest-edge communities. To provide a broader context for understanding grass-endophyte associations we characterized fungal endophyte communities inhabiting foliage of 11 species of phylogenetically diverse C3 grasses in the understory of a lowland tropical forest at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Our sample included members of early-arising subfamilies of Poaceae that are endemic to forests, as well as more recently arising subfamilies that transitioned to open environments. Isolation on culture media and direct PCR and cloning revealed that these grasses harbor species-rich and phylogenetically diverse communities that lack the endophytic Clavicipitaceae known from diverse woodland and pasture grasses in the temperate zone. Both the incidence and diversity of endophytes was consistent among grass species regardless of subfamily, clade affiliation or ancestral habitat use. Genotype and phylogenetic analyses suggest that these endophytic fungi are predominantly host generalists, shared not only among distinctive lineages of Poaceae but also with non-grass plants at the same site. © 2011 by The Mycological Society of America.","Ascomycota;

These plants invest energy in growth when herbivores are absent but shunt energy to defense when herbivores are present. In contrast, constitutive defenses are expressed continuously regardless of herbivore presence. Induction has been widely documented in temperate plants but has not been reported from tropical plants. Most tropical plants have higher, more constant herbivore pressure than temperate plants. In this situation, it is hypothesized that constitutive defenses rather than induced defense would be favored. Using natural herbivores of four species of Inga saplings on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, herbivore presence was crossed with ant presence to determine their effects on extrafloral nectar production. Analysis of nectar samples revealed that Inga species do not induce nectar production in response to herbivores. This result is not due to an inability of the plants to respond, as the plants in this study increased nectar production in response to light and ant presence. Contrary to most induction experiments with temperate ecosystem plants, these results demonstrate that tropical plants do not induce one type of defense, and they suggest that the most adaptive defense strategies are different for the two ecosystems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Constitutive defense; Facultative mutualism; Herbivory; Inga; Plant-insect interaction","ant; antiherbivore defense; dicotyledon; herbivore; mutualism; nectar; plant-insect interaction; temperate environment; animal; ant; article; classification; ecosystem; feeding behavior; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nectar; Panama; physiology; plant leaf; plant physiology; symbiosis; tropic climate; Animals; Ants; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Panama; Plant Leaves; Plant Nectar; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Symbiosis; Tropical Climate; Barro Colorado Island; Panama [Central America]; Panama [Panama (NTN)]; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Inga",,"Plant Nectar",,,,"Apple, J.L., Feener, D.H., Ant visitation of extrafloral nectaries of Passiflora: the effects of nectary attributes and ant behavior on patterns in facultative ant-plant mutualisms (2001) Oecologia, 127, pp. 409-416; Arimura, G., Kost, C., Boland, W., Herbivore-induced, indirect plant defences (2005) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1734, pp. 91-111; Baker, H.G., Baker, I., Amino-acids in nectar and their evolutionary significance (1973) Nature, 241, pp. 543-545; Baker, H.G., Baker, I., Chemical constituents of nectar in relation to pollination mechanisms and phyologeny (1982) Biochemical Aspects of Evolutionary Biology, pp. 131-171. , M.

Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of plant defenses against their herbivores may be central for our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Here, we address the evolution of antiherbivore defenses and their possible contribution to coexistence in the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). Inga has >300 species, has radiated recently, and is frequently one of the most diverse and abundant genera at a given site. For 37 species from Panama and Peru we characterized developmental, ant, and chemical defenses against herbivores. We found extensive variation in defenses, but little evidence of phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, developmental, ant, and chemical defenses varied independently (were orthogonal) and appear to have evolved independently of each other. Our results are consistent with strong selection for divergent defensive traits, presumably mediated by herbivores. In an analysis of community assembly, we found that Inga species co-occurring as neighbors are more different in antiherbivore defenses than random, suggesting that possessing a rare defense phenotype increases fitness. These results imply that interactions with herbivores may be an important axis of niche differentiation that permits the coexistence of many species of Inga within a single site. Interactions between plants and their herbivores likely play a key role in the generation and maintenance of the conspicuously high plant diversity in the tropics.","Community assembly; Herbivory; Phylogenetic signal; Plant defenses; Tropical diversity","chemical compound; imino acid; phenol derivative; saponin; tyrosine; ant; antiherbivore defense; article; chloroplast; DNA sequence; herbivore; nectar; Neotropics; nonhuman; Panama; Peru; phenotype; phylogeny; plant community; plant defense; plant leaf; priority journal; signal transduction; tree; Animals; Ants; Biological Evolution; Chlorophyll; Fabaceae; Food Chain; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Selection, Genetic; Fabaceae; Inga","GENBANK: FJ974145, FJ974151, FJ974164, FJ974180, FJ974241, FJ974279, FJ974351, FJ974409, FJ974438, FJ974449, FJ974509, FJ974628, FJ974673, FJ974683, FJ974713, FJ974870, FJ974883, FJ974910, FJ974975, FJ974988, FJ975003, FJ975011, FJ975039, GQ118709, GQ118710, GQ118711, GQ118712, GQ118713, GQ118714, GQ118715, GQ118716, GQ118717, GQ118718, GQ118719, GQ118720, GQ118721, GQ118722, GQ118723, GQ118724, GQ118725, GQ118726, GQ118727, GQ118728, GQ118729, GQ118730, GQ118731, GQ118732, GQ118733, GQ118734, GQ118735, GQ118736, GQ118737, GQ118738, GQ118739, GQ118740, GQ118741, GQ118742, GQ118743, GQ118744, GQ118745, GQ118746, GQ118747, GQ118748, GQ118749, GQ118750, GQ118751, GQ118752, GQ118753, GQ118754, GQ118755, GQ118756, GQ118757, GQ118758, GQ118759, GQ118760, GQ118761, GQ118762, GQ118763, GQ118764, GQ118765, GQ118766, GQ118767, GQ118768, GQ118769, GQ118770, GQ118771, GQ118772, GQ118773, GQ118774, GQ118775, GQ118776, GQ118777, GQ118778, GQ118779, GQ118780, GQ118781, GQ118782, GQ118783, GQ118784, GQ118785, GQ118786, GQ118787, GQ118788, GQ118789, GQ118790, GQ118791, GQ118792, GQ118793, GQ118794, GQ118795, GQ118796, GQ118797, GQ118798, GQ118799, GQ118800, GQ118801, GQ118802, GQ118803, GQ118804, GQ118805, GQ118806, GQ118807, GQ118808, GQ118809, GQ118810, GQ118811, GQ118812, GQ118813, GQ118814, GQ118815, GQ118816, GQ118817, GQ118818, GQ118819, GQ118820, GQ118821, GQ118822, GQ118823, GQ118824, GQ118825, GQ118826, GQ118827, GQ118828, GQ118829, GQ118830, GQ118831, GQ118832, GQ118833, GQ118834, GQ118835, GQ118836, GQ118837, GQ118838, GQ118839, GQ118840, GQ118841, GQ118842, GQ118843, GQ118844, GQ118845, GQ118846, GQ118847, GQ118848, GQ118849, GQ118850, GQ118851, GQ118852, GQ118853, GQ118854, GQ118855, GQ118856, GQ118857, GQ118858, GQ118859, GQ118860, GQ118861, GQ118862, GQ118863, GQ118864, GQ118865, GQ118866, GQ118867, GQ118868, GQ118869, GQ118870, GQ118871, GQ118872, GQ118873, GQ118874, GQ118875, GQ118876, GQ118877, GQ118878, GQ118879, GQ118880, GQ118881, GQ118882, GQ118883, GQ118884, GQ118885, GQ118886, GQ118887, GQ118888, GQ118889, GQ118890, GQ871263, GQ871264, GQ871265, GQ871266, GQ871267, GQ871268, GQ871269, GQ871270, GQ871271, GQ871272, GQ871273, GQ871274, GQ871275, GQ871276, GQ871277, GQ871278, GQ892055","saponin, 8047-15-2; tyrosine, 16870-43-2, 55520-40-6, 60-18-4; Chlorophyll, 1406-65-1",,,,"Agrawal, A.A., Macroevolution of plant defense strategies (2007) Trends Ecol Evol, 22, pp. 103-109; Agrawal, A.A., Fishbein, M., Plant defense syndromes (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. S132-S149; Becerra, J.X., Insects on plants: Macroevolutionary chemical trends in host use (1997) Science, 276 (5310), pp. 253-256. , DOI 10.1126/science.276.5310.253; Becerra, J.X., The impact of herbivore-plant coevolution on plant community structure (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104 (18), pp. 7483-7488. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.0608253104; Farrell, B.D., Dussourd, D.E., Mitter, C., Escalation of plant defense: Do latex and resin canals spur plant diversification?

In the species-rich tropics, a gradient in rainfall between wet evergreen and dry seasonal forests correlates with turnover of plant species. The strength of the dry season has previously been shown to correlate with species composition. Herbivores and pathogens (pests) have also been hypothesized to be important drivers of plant distribution, although empirical evidence is lacking. In this study we experimentally tested the existence of a gradient in pest pressure across a rainfall gradient in the Isthmus of Panama and measured the influence of pests relative to drought on species turnover. We established two common gardens on the dry and wet sides of the Isthmus using seedlings from 24 plant species with contrasting distributions along the Isthmus. By experimentally manipulating water availability and insect herbivore access, we showed that pests are not as strong a determinant of plant distributions as is seasonal drought. Seasonal drought in the dry site excluded wetdistribution species by significantly increasing their seedling mortality. Pathogen mortality and insect herbivore damage were both higher in the wet site, supporting the existence of a gradient in pest pressure. However, contrary to predictions, we found little evidence that drydistribution species suffered significantly more pest attack than wet-distribution species. Instead, we hypothesize that dry-distribution species are limited from colonizing wetter forests by their inherently slower growth rates imposed by drought adaptations. We conclude that mechanisms limiting the recruitment of dry-distribution species in wet forests are not nearly as strong as those limiting wet-distribution species from dry forests. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Drought tolerance; Herbivory; Panama; Pathogen attack; Rainfall gradient; Tree distribution; Tropical forests","rain; water; biodiversity; community composition; drought stress; dry season; environmental change; experimental study; herbivore; herbivory; mortality; pest species; rainfall; spatial distribution; tolerance; tree; tropical forest; water availability; animal; article; demography; physiology; plant disease; season; time; tree; tropic climate; Animals; Demography; Plant Diseases; Rain; Seasons; Time Factors; Trees; Tropical Climate; Water; Central America; Isthmus of Panama; Panama [Central America]; Hexapoda",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Baltzer, J.L., Davies, S.J., Bunyavejchewin, S., Noor, N.S.M., The role of desiccation tolerance in determining tree species distributions along the Malay-Thai Peninsula (2008) Functional Ecology, 22, pp. 221-231; Baltzer, J.L., Davies, S.J., Noor, N.S.M., Kassim, A.R., LaFrankie, J.V., Geographical distributions in tropical trees: Can geographical range predict performance and habitat association in co-occurring tree species?

Habitat specialization models predict that adaptations to environmental conditions explain species distributions. In tropical rainforests, the ability of the seedlings to survive during drought has been shown to be a key determinant of species distributions. We hypothesize that differences among species in their tolerance to low tissue water status is the mechanism underlying differences in performance during drought. 2. To test this hypothesis we quantified tolerance to low leaf water status for over 20 species from central Panama in screenhouse experiments using two different experimental approaches. Results from both approaches were highly correlated with each other. 3. We found that tolerance to low leaf water status correlated with species drought performance in the field and with their distribution across a gradient of dry season length, with the more desiccation-tolerant species having higher survival in dry relative to irrigated conditions, and occurring in drier areas. These results support the hypothesis that, in tropical forests, tolerance to low tissue water status governs seedling performance during drought, as well as being a determinant of species distribution patterns. 4. Lower tolerance to low leaf water status was correlated with greater stem hydraulic conductance. In addition, all species tested, including both desiccation-sensitive and desiccation-resistant species, showed similar losses of xylem conductance, about 80%, when near death. These results suggest that a principal mechanism by which desiccation leads to plant mortality is the loss of xylem conductivity. © 2008 The Authors.","Drought resistance; Dry season; Hydraulic conductance; Rainfall; Water potential","drought resistance; ecosystem modeling; hydraulic conductivity; mortality; plant water relations; seedling; survival",,,,,,"Baltzer, J.L., Davies, S.J., Bunyavejchewin, S., Noor, N.S.M., The role of desiccation tolerance in determining tree species distributions along the Malay-Thai Peninsula (2008) Functional Ecology, 22, pp. 221-231; Bongers, F., Poorter, L., Van Rompaey, R.S.A.R., Parren, M.P.E., Distribution of twelve moist forest canopy tree species in Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire: Response curves to a climatic gradient (1999) Journal of Vegetation Science, 10, pp. 371-382; Brodribb, T., Hill, R.S., The importance of xylem constraints on the distribution of conifer species (1999) New Phytologist, 143, pp. 356-372; Christensen, J.H., Hewitson, B., Busuioc, A., Al, E., Chapter 11.

While water availability along these gradients is an important determinant of species distributions, other abiotic and biotic factors correlate with rainfall and may also contribute to limit species distribution. One of these is soil fertility, which is often lower in the wetter forests. To test its possible role in species distribution along a rainfall gradient, we performed a screen-house experiment where we measured the growth performance of seedlings of 23 species with contrasting distributions across the Isthmus of Panama. We grew seedlings in soils collected from the drier Pacific side and the wetter Atlantic side. Differences in soil fertility across the Isthmus were large enough to significantly influence the growth performance of the seedlings. However, we found no evidence of home-soil advantage among species with contrasting distributions. Dry-distribution species grew on average slower than wet-distribution species suggesting a cost to drought adaptations. The response to soil differences correlated with the growth rate of the species, such that fast-growing species responded more to changes in soil quality. We hypothesize that inherently slow growth rates of some dry-distribution tropical species may be a more important factor limiting their colonization of wetter sites along the rainfall gradient. © 2008 The Authors.",,"colonization; drought; growth rate; growth response; performance assessment; plant; rainfall; soil fertility; soil quality; soil water; spatial distribution; testing method; water availability; Central America; Isthmus of Panama; Panama [Central America]",,,,,,"Baltzer, J.L., Edaphic specialization in tropical trees: Physiological correlates and responses to reciprocal transplantation (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 3063-3077; Baltzer, J.L., Geographical distributions in tropical trees: Can geographical range predict performance and habitat association in co-occurring tree species?

Photosynthetic pigments were quantified in nine Inga species and species from three other genera. In Inga, Lx levels were high in shade leaves (mostly above 20 mmol mol-1 chlorophyll) and low in sun leaves. In Virola surinamensis, both sun and shade leaves exhibited very high Lx contents (about 60 mmol mol-1 chlorophyll). In Inga marginata grown under high irradiance, Lx slowly accumulated within several days upon transfer to deep shade. When shade leaves of I. marginata were briefly exposed to the sunlight, both violaxanthin and Lx were quickly de-epoxidized. Subsequently, overnight recovery occurred only for violaxanthin, not for Lx. In such leaves, containing reduced levels of Lx and increased levels of L, chlorophyll fluorescence induction showed significantly slower reduction of the photosystem II electron acceptor, QA, and faster formation as well as a higher level of non-photochemical quenching. The results indicate that slow Lx accumulation in Inga leaves may improve light harvesting under limiting light, while quick de-epoxidation of Lx to L in response to excess light may enhance photoprotection. © 2008 The Authors.","Carotene; Lutein; Non-photochemical quenching; Photoacclimation; Shade leaves; Sun leaves; Xanthophyll","carotenoid; drug derivative; epoxide; xanthophyll; irradiance; legume; light effect; photoreception; photosynthesis; pigment; tropical environment; woody plant; acclimatization; article; darkness; legume; metabolism; photosystem II; physiology; plant leaf; seedling; species difference; sunlight; time; tree; Acclimatization; Carotenoids; Darkness; Epoxy Compounds; Fabaceae; Lutein; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plant Leaves; Seedling; Species Specificity; Sunlight; Time Factors; Trees; Inga; Virola surinamensis",,"xanthophyll, 127-40-2, 52842-48-5; Carotenoids, 36-88-4; Epoxy Compounds; Lutein, 127-40-2; Photosystem II Protein Complex",,,,"Adams, W.W., Iii, Demmig-Adams, B., Verhoeven, A.S., Barker, D.H., Photoinhibition during winter stress: Involvement of sustained xanthophyll cycle-dependent energy dissipation (1995) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 22, pp. 261-276; Anderson, J.M., Chow, W.S., Goodchild, D.J., Thylakoid membrane organization in sun/shade acclimation (1988) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 15, pp. 11-26; Baker, N.R., Rosenqvist, E., Applications of chlorophyll fluorescence can improve crop production strategies: An examination of future possibilities (2004) Journal of Experimental Botany, 55, pp. 1607-1621; Baker, D.H., Adams, W.W., Iii, Demmig-Adams, B., Logan, B.A., Verhoeven, A.S., Smith, S.D., Nocturnally retained zeaxanthin does not remain engaged in a state primed for energy dissipation during the summer in two Yucca species growing in the Mojave Desert (2002) Plant, Cell & Environment, 25, pp. 95-103; Björkman, O., Responses to different quantum flux densities (1981) Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology Vol. 12A Physiological Plant Ecology I, Responses to the Physical Environment, pp. 57-107. , In. eds.

Tropical plants express multiple defensive traits that enable them to resist, deter or escape herbivores. In this study, we approached plant defensive adaptations by focusing on variation and interaction between sets of plant defensive strategies from a community perspective. 2. We compared two sites: the aseasonal Amazonian forest of Yasuni, Ecuador, and the seasonal forest of Barro Colorado National Monument (BCNM), Panama. We suggest that differences in ant abundance between these sites influence the divergence, local assembly and interaction of chemical and indirect ant-mediated defences in 18 tree species of the genus Inga (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae). 3. Relative ant abundance and visitation to extra floral nectaries were significantly higher at Yasuni than at BCNM. Correspondingly, Yasuni Ingas had low leaf extract bioactivity compared with BCNM Ingas, suggesting that Yasuni Ingas rely more on indirect ant defences, while BCNM Ingas rely more on chemical defences. 4. Yasuni Ingas varied widely in their ant visitation and extract bioactivity, and the strategies were negatively correlated in a trade-off like pattern. In comparison, BCNM Ingas had a positive correlation and little variation in their ant visitation, suggesting that their defence ecology was driven by environmental characteristics other than ants. 5. An experiment planting the same Inga species at both sites supported the prediction of higher herbivore pressure at Yasuni than at BCNM. However, leaf damage to naturally occurring Ingas was similar between sites, suggesting that the adaptations at the two sites were equally effective. Damage levels were also similar among species with contrasting defensive strategies, suggesting that ant and chemical strategies were also equally effective at a single site. 6. Synthesis. While tropical forests are thought to be a cradle of specialized interactions that promote diversification and allow the coexistence of a large number of species, the observed divergence in the defence ecology of Inga between these two sites suggests that general community characteristics can also promote diversity by favouring local and geographical diversity in defensive solutions. © 2007 The Authors.","Ant defences; Chemical defences; Community interactions; Defence assembly; Extra-floral nectaries; Herbivore pressure; Herbivory; Indirect defences; Inga; Seasonality","abundance; adaptation; chemical defense; coexistence; divergence; herbivory; interspecific interaction; Neotropical region; Barro Colorado Nature Monument; Central America; Colon [Panama]; Ecuador; Napo; Panama [Central America]; South America; Yasuni National Park; Fabaceae; Formicidae; Inga; Mimosoideae",,,,,,"Aide, M.T., Patterns of leaf development and herbivory in a tropical understory Community (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 455-466; Barton, A.M., Spatial variation in the effect of ants on an extrafloral nectary plant (1986) Ecology, 67, pp. 495-504; Bentley, B.L., Extrafloral nectaries and protection by pugnacious bodyguards (1977) Annual Reviews of Ecology and Systematics, 8, pp. 407-427; Brenes-Arguedas, T., Horton, M.W., Coley, P.D., Lokvam, J., Waddel, R.A., Meisozo-O'Meara, B.E., Kursar, T.A., Contrasting mechanisms of secondary metabolite accumulation during leaf development in two tropical tree species with different leaf expansion strategies (2006) Oecologia, 149, pp. 91-100; Coley, P.D., Herbivory and defensive characteristics of tree species in a lowland tropical forest (1983) Ecological Monographs, 53, pp. 209-233; Coley, P.D., Kursar, T.A., (1996) Anti-herbivore Defences of Young Tropical Leaves: Physiological Constrains and Ecological Tradeoffs, pp. 305-336. , Tropical Forest Plant Ecophysiology.

In this study we examined seedling mortality in relation to seasonality, i.e., flooding versus drought, of the dominant tree species (Prioria copaifera), and three associated species (Pterocarpus officinalis, Carapa guianensis and Pentaclethra macroloba), in seasonally flooded forests (SFF) in Darien, Panama. Seedling mortality differed among species, years and seasons. Prioria seedlings experienced the lowest overall mortality, and after 3 years many more Prioria seedlings remained alive than those of any of the associated species. In general, within species, larger seedlings had greater survival. Seed size, which can vary by close to 2 orders of magnitude in Prioria, had a confounding effect with that of topography. Large-seeded Prioria seedlings experienced 1.5 times greater mortality than small-seeded seedlings, as large-seeded Prioria seedlings were more likely to be located in depressions. This finding suggests that seed size, plant size and topography are important in understanding SFF regeneration. For all species, seedling mortality was consistently greater during the dry season than during flooding. For Prioria, dry season seedling mortality was correlated with drought stress, that is, high mortality during the long El Niño dry season of 1998 and the normal dry season of 2000, but very low dry season mortality during the mild dry season of 1999. Prioria's ability to dominate in seasonally flooded forest of Central America is partly explained by its low drought-related mortality in comparison to associated species. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Low diversity; Seasonality; Seed size; Swamps; Topographical relief","rain; annual variation; dicotyledon; dominance; drought; El Nino; floodplain forest; mortality; rainfall; regeneration; seedling; article; disaster; ecosystem; physiology; seedling; time; tree; tropic climate; Ecosystem; Natural Disasters; Rain; Seedling; Time Factors; Trees; Tropical Climate; Central America; Darien; Panama [Central America]; Carapa guianensis; Pentaclethra macroloba; Prioria; Prioria copaifera; Pterocarpus; Pterocarpus officinalis",,,,,,"Baruch, Z., Responses to drought and flooding in tropical forage grasses. 1.

Hence, developing nations must establish the capacity to resolve their problems. Additionally, policy-makers and donors need to obtain scientific input on issues such as global change and ecosystem services. We propose that for nations rich in biodiversity, ecosystem services derived from bioprospecting, or drug discovery, could contribute to economic development. In the case where unstudied samples are shipped abroad for research, the chances of obtaining royalties are infinitesimally small. Therefore developing nations will only realize benefits from bioprospecting through in-country research on their own biodiversity. Policy-makers and donors have failed to appreciate the value of this approach. In order to provide an example of the inherent links between conservation and sustainable economic development, we initiated a drug discovery effort in Panama that emphasizes local benefit. As much of the drug discovery process as possible is conducted in Panamanian laboratories, providing jobs dependent on intact biodiversity and enhancing local research and training. In short, research, plus the spin-offs from research, provide immediate and long-lasting benefits to Panama. The connection between conservation and development has been highlighted in publicity about the project in Panama's urban media. This provides a constructive alternative to the perception the among the urban populace that economic development inevitably competes with conservation. In summary, our program uses biodiversity to promote human health as well as to support research capacity, economic development and conservation within Panama. The program provides an example of the widely recognized but little developed concept of bioprospecting research as an ecosystem service. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bioprospecting; Chagas' disease; Convention on biological diversity; Ecosystem services; ICBG; Leishmaniasis; Malaria; Panama; Policy-makers; Sustainable development","biodiversity; ecosystem service; leishmaniasis; malaria; policy making; sustainable development; Central America; Panama [Central America]",,,,,,"Agnew, B., When pharma merges, R & D is the dowry (2000) Science, 287, pp. 1952-1953; Aide, T.M., Grau, H.R., Globalization, migration and Latin American ecosystems (2004) Science, 305, pp. 1915-1916; Aldhous, P., 'Hunting licence' for drugs (1991) Nature, 353, p. 290; Angell, M., The truth about the drug companies (2004) New York Rev Books, 51, pp. 52-58. , July 15; Annan, K., A challenge to the world scientists (2003) Science, 299, p. 1485; Beattie, A., Barthlott, W., Elisabetsky, E., Hassan, R., Scholes, R., Ash, N., Chapter 10.

A major challenge in community ecology and evolutionary biogeography is to reveal the mechanisms underlying these differences. For herbivorous insects, one such mechanism leading to an increased number of species in a given locale could be increased ecological specialization, resulting in a greater proportion of insect species occupying narrow niches within a community. We tested this hypothesis by comparing host specialization in larval Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) at eight different New World forest sites ranging in latitude from 15° S to 55° N. Here we show that larval diets of tropical Lepidoptera are more specialized than those of their temperate forest counterparts: tropical species on average feed on fewer plant species, genera and families than do temperate caterpillars. This result holds true whether calculated per lepidopteran family or for a caterpillar assemblage as a whole. As a result, there is greater turnover in caterpillar species composition (greater Β diversity) between tree species in tropical faunas than in temperate faunas. We suggest that greater specialization in tropical faunas is the result of differences in trophic interactions; for example, there are more distinct plant secondary chemical profiles from one tree species to the next in tropical forests than in temperate forests as well as more diverse and chronic pressures from natural enemy communities. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"biogeography; caterpillar; community composition; diet; evolution; host specificity; insect; specialization; temperate forest; trophic interaction; tropical forest; article; biodiversity; caterpillar; controlled study; ecology; herbivore; host range; Lepidoptera; nonhuman; priority journal; temperate deciduous forest; tropical rain forest; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"Hillebrand, H., On the generality of the latitudinal diversity gradient (2004) Am.

Efforts to evaluate proposed mechanisms have been hampered by a lack of comparative data on species' reactions to relevant axes of environmental variation. Here we show that differential drought sensitivity shapes plant distributions in tropical forests at both regional and local scales. Our analyses are based on experimental field assessments of drought sensitivity of 48 species of trees and shrubs, and on their local and regional distributions within a network of 122 inventory sites spanning a rainfall gradient across the Isthmus of Panama. Our results suggest that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local- and regional-scale distributions of tropical trees. Changes in soil moisture availability caused by global climate change and forest fragmentation are therefore likely to alter tropical species distributions, community composition and diversity. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"rain; soil water; climate change; drought stress; environmental gradient; global climate; habitat fragmentation; niche partitioning; precipitation intensity; soil water potential; spatial distribution; species diversity; tropical forest; article; climate change; drought; priority journal; shrub; soil moisture; species distribution; tree; tropical rain forest; water availability; Central America; Panama [Central America]",,,,,,"Veenendaal, E.

We present a bioprospecting program that, in addition to promoting drug discovery, provides economic benefits to and promotes conservation in Panama through the sustainable use of biodiversity. The program was initiated using insights from 20 years ofnonapplied ecological research to enhance the likelihood of finding treatments for human disease. Samples are not sent abroad; rather, most of the research is carried out in Panamanian laboratories. Panama has received immediate benefits for the use of its biodiversity in the form of research funding derived from sources outside Panama, training for young Panamanian scientists, and enhanced laboratory infrastructure.

Of the 47 species of caterpillars (747 individuals) recorded, each fed on a distinct set of Inga. In the field, 96% of the individuals were found on young leaves. Growth rates of caterpillars that were fed leaves in the laboratory were 60% higher on young leaves compared to mature leaves. When caterpillars were fed leaves of nonhost Inga, they grew more slowly. These data provide support for a link between preference and performance. However, among hosts on which larvae normally occurred, faster growth rates were not associated with greater host electivity (the proportion of larvae found on each host species in the field, corrected for host abundance). Growth rates on normal hosts were positively correlated with leaf expansion rates of the host, and fast expansion was associated with leaves with higher nutritional content. Detailed studies on a gelechiid leaf roller, the species with the largest diet breadth, allowed us to assess the importance of factors other than growth that could influence diet electivity. This species showed a 1.7-fold difference in growth rate among Inga hosts and faster growth on species with fast-expanding leaves. However, there was no correlation between caterpillar growth rate and abundance on different host species. Instead, abundance of the gelechiid on each Inga species was significantly correlated with the temporal predictability of food (synchrony of leaf flushing) and was negatively correlated with competition (amount of leaf area removed by species other than the gelechiid). Although rates of parasitism were high (23-43%), there were no differences among hosts. Parasitism was also not related to measures of escape, such as growth rates of caterpillars, leaf expansion rates, and synchrony of leaf production. Together, food availability, parasitism, and competition explained 84% of the variation in host preference by the gelechiid. We suggest that these ecological interactions may be particularly important in determining diet choice initially and that preferences may be reinforced by subsequent divergence in host chemistry and/or the herbivore's ability to tolerate the secondary metabolites. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Competition; Electivity; Gelechiid; Herbivore growth; Inga; Leaf expansion; Leafing phenology; Lepidoptera; Panama; Parasitism; Plant quality","caterpillar; feeding behavior; food preference; food quality; growth rate; interspecific competition; Neotropical region; parasitism; animal; article; competitive behavior; ecosystem; food preference; growth, development and aging; host parasite interaction; larva; legume; Lepidoptera; parasitology; physiology; plant leaf; species difference; Animals; Competitive Behavior; Ecosystem; Fabaceae; Food Preferences; Host-Parasite Relations; Larva; Lepidoptera; Plant Leaves; Species Specificity; Barro Colorado Island; Central America; Gatun Lake; Panama [Central America]; Fabaceae; Gelechiidae; Inga; Lepidoptera; Mimosoideae; Tortricidae",,,,,,"Aide, T.M., Herbivory as a selective agent on the timing of leaf production in a tropical understory community (1988) Nature, 336, pp. 574-575; Aide, T.M., Londoño, E.C., The effects of rapid leaf expansion on the growth and survivorship of a lepidopteran herbivore (1989) Oikos, 55, pp. 66-70; Appel, H.M., Martin, M.M., Significance of metabolic load in the evolution of host specificity of Manduca sexta (1992) Ecology, 73, pp. 216-228; Ballabeni, P., Wlodarczyk, M., Rahier, M., Does enemy-free space for eggs contribute to a leaf beetle's oviposition preference for a nutritionally inferior host plant?

We provide the protocol for a rapid, efficient assay using a 96-well microtiter plate format for testing extracts for activity against the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae), and the black bean aphid, Aphis craccivora Koch. Assays of extracts composed of low molecular weight metabolites from 28 species of plants from 15 families from Panamanian forest showed variation in toxicity to A. craccivora. Three metabolite extracts and one protein extract were active, with more than 70% mortality in 72 h, averaged over three independent experiments. For three species of plants with protein extracts having intermediate activity, the metabolite extracts were inactive; hence, the activity probably was due to the toxic proteins, rather than contaminating toxic metabolites.","Artificial diet;

Selection on young leaves has led to diverse forms of defense chemical expression. Though most allelochemicals are secondary metabolites, allelochemic function for a primary metabolite remains a possibility. We recently observed this phenomenon in the young leaves of Inga umbellifera, which accumulate the protein amino acid L-tyrosine to very high levels. We isolated L-tyrosine from young leaves of trees in Panama and characterized it using spectroscopic and chemical means. We chromatographically quantified leaf L-tyrosine levels across a range of developmental stages, showing that it was present in the youngest leaves and that its concentration increased throughout the period of expansion, reaching an average maximum of ca 10% of leaf dry mass in late-stage young leaves. This chemical phenotype was seen to be highly leaf-age specific: Free tyrosine was only present in mature leaves at very low levels. In bioassays with larvae of the noctuid moth H. virescens, L-tyrosine proved to be a potent growth inhibitor when added to artificial diet at 10% of dry mass. This suggests that a rarely observed defense strategy occurs in young I. umbellifera leaves, a hyper-produced primary metabolite functioning as an allelochemical.","5-amino-4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid; Barro Colorado Island; Chemical defense; Fabaceae; Inga umbellifera; Panama; Primary metabolite; Tyrosine","allelochemical; amino acid; bioassay; chromatography; developmental stage; dicotyledon; herbivory; phenotype; secondary metabolite; tropical forest; Central America; Panama [Central America]; Fabaceae; Inga umbellifera; Lepidoptera; Noctuidae",,,,,,"Awmack, C.S., Leather, S.R., Host plant quality and fecundity in herbivorous insects (2002) Annual Review of Entomology, 47, pp. 817-844; Bais, H.P., Walker, T.S., Stermitz, F.R., Hufbauer, R.A., Vivanco, J.M., Enantiomeric-dependent phytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of (±)-catechin: A rhizosecreted racemic mixture from spotted knapweed (2002) Plant Physiology, 128, pp. 1173-1179; Benrey, B., Denno, R.F., The slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis: A test using the cabbage butterfly (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 987-999; Berenbaum, M.R., Turnabout is fair play: Secondary roles for primary compounds (1995) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 21, pp. 925-940; Bryant, J.P., Chapin, F.S., Klein, D., Carbon/nutrient balance of boreal plants in relation to vertebrate herbivory (1983) Oikos, 40, pp. 357-368; Carta, R., Tola, G., Solubilities of L-cystine, L-tyrosine, Lleucine, and glycine in aqueous solutions at various pH's and NaCl concentrations (1996) Journal of Chemical Engineering Data, 41, pp. 414-417; Clancy, K.M., The role of sugars in western spruce budworm nutritional ecology (1992) Ecological Entomology, 17, pp. 189-197; Coley, P.D., Barone, J.A., Herbivory and plant defenses in tropical forests (1996) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 27, pp. 305-335; Coley, P.D., Lokvam, J., Rudolph, K., Bromberg, K., Sackett, T.E., Wright, L.J., Brenes-Arguedas, T., Kursar, T.A., Divergent defensive strategies of young leaves in two Neotropical species of Inga (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2633-2643; Dow, J.A.T., pH gradients in Lepidopteran midgut (1992) Journal of Experimental Biology, 172, pp. 355-375; Feeny, P.P., Plant apparency and chemical defense (1976) Recent Advances in Phytochemistry, 10, pp. 1-40. , J.

We censused eighty-eight 0.09-ha plots scattered across the landscape. Environmental control, local dispersal and historical contingency were represented by environmental variables (soil moisture, slope, soil type, distance to shore, old-forest presence), a spatial autoregressive parameter (ρ), and four spatial trend variables, respectively. We built regression models, representing all combinations of the three hypotheses, for each species. The probability that the best model included the environmental variables, spatial trend variables and ρ averaged 33%, 64% and 50% across the study species, respectively. The environmental variables, spatial trend variables, ρ, and a simple intercept model received the strongest support for 4, 15, 5 and 2 species, respectively. Comparing the model results to information on species traits showed that species with strong spatial trends produced few and heavy diaspores, while species with strong soil moisture relationships were particularly drought-sensitive. In conclusion, history and local dispersal appeared to be the dominant controls of the distributions of common plant species on BCI.

Considerable theoretical effort has focused on predicting optimal defense and tradeoffs in defense allocation during leaf expansion. Among others, allocation to secondary chemistry may be dependent on growth constraints. We studied flavanoid production during leaf development in two species of Inga (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) with different expansion strategies: Inga goldmanii, a species with slowly expanding young leaves, and Inga umbellifera, a species with fast-expanding young leaves. In these two species, the most abundant and toxic class of defensive compounds is flavanoids (which include tannins). We measured their concentration by leaf dry weight, their total content per leaf, their HPLC chemical profile and their toxicity to a generalist herbivore at different expansion levels. Although in both species the flavanoid concentration decreased with increasing leaf expansion, that decrease was twice as pronounced for I. umbellifera as it was for I. goldmanii. I. umbellifera leaves produced flavanoids only during the first half of their development while I. goldmanii leaves continued production throughout. The changes in flavanoid HPLC profiles and toxicity were also more dramatic for I. umbellifera, which had different flavanoids in young than in mature leaves. Relative to I. umbellifera, I. goldmanii showed smaller changes in both flavanoid composition and toxicity in the transition from young to mature leaves. These results indicate that, even though young leaves suffer higher rates of attack and are predicted to have better chemical defenses than mature leaves, growth constraints may modulate defense allocation and thus, evolution of defense strategies. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Condensed tannins; Growth-differentiation hypothesis; Inga; Optimal defense; Plant defense","flavonoid; accumulation; leaf; metabolite; organic compound; plant defense; plant extract; secondary metabolite; toxic substance; tropical forest; adaptation; age; animal; article; chemistry; comparative study; drug effect; growth, development and aging; high performance liquid chromatography; legume; metabolism; moth; Panama; plant leaf; principal component analysis; species difference; toxicity testing; tropic climate; Adaptation, Physiological; Age Factors; Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fabaceae; Flavonoids; Moths; Panama; Plant Leaves; Principal Component Analysis; Species Specificity; Toxicity Tests; Tropical Climate; Fabaceae; Inga; Inga umbellifera; Mimosoideae",,"Flavonoids",,,,"Ayres, M.P., Clausen, T.P., MacLean Jr., S.F., Redman, A.M., Reichardt, P.B., Diversity of structure and antiherbivore activity in condensed tannins (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1696-1712; Baldwin, I.T., Karb, M.J., Plasticity in allocation of nicotine to reproductive parts in Nicotiana attenuata (1995) J Chem Ecol, 21, pp. 897-909; Brooks, J.S., Feeny, P.P., Seasonal variation in Daucus carota leaf-surface and leaf-tissue chemical profiles (2004) Biochem Syst Ecol, 32, pp. 769-782; Coley, P.D., Herbivory and defensive characteristics of tree species in a lowland tropical forest (1983) Ecol Monogr, 53, pp. 209-233; Coley, P.D., Effects of plant growth rate and leaf lifetime on the amount and type of anti-herbivore defense (1988) Oecologia, 74, pp. 531-536; Coley, P.D., Aide, M.T., Comparison of herbivory and plant defenses in temperate and tropical broad-leaved forests (1991) Plant-animal Interactions: Evolutionary Ecology and Temperate Regions, pp. 25-49. , Price PW, Lewinson TM, Fernandes GW, Benson WW (eds).

We hypothesized that short dry spells during the wet season are a significant source of mortality for the newly emerging seedlings of pioneer species that recruit in treefall gaps in tropical forests. An analysis of a 49-year rainfall record for three forests across a rainfall gradient in central Panama confirmed that dry spells of ≥ 10 days during the wet season occur on average once a year in a deciduous forest, and once every other year in a semi-deciduous moist and an evergreen wet forest. The effect of wet season dry spells on the recruitment of pioneers was investigated by comparing seedling survival in rain-protected dry plots and irrigated control plots in four large artificially created treefall gaps in a semi-deciduous tropical forest. In rain-protected plots surface soil layers dried rapidly, leading to a strong gradient in water potential within the upper 10 cm of soil. Seedling survival for six pioneer species was significantly lower in rain-protected than in irrigated control plots after only 4 days. The strength of the irrigation effect differed among species, and first became apparent 3-10 days after treatments started. Root allocation patterns were significantly, or marginally significantly, different between species and between two groups of larger and smaller seeded species. However, they were not correlated with seedling drought sensitivity, suggesting allocation is not a key trait for drought sensitivity in pioneer seedlings. Our data provide strong evidence that short dry spells in the wet season differentially affect seedling survivorship of pioneer species, and may therefore have important implications to seedling demography and community dynamics. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","BCI; Diversity; Drought; Gap partitioning; Survival","water; deciduous forest; dry season; mortality; pioneer species; seedling; wet season; article; Bombacaceae; Cecropia; Melastomataceae; Panama; physiology; Piperaceae; seedling; soil; Tiliaceae; tropic climate; weather; Bombacaceae; Cecropia Plant; Melastomataceae; Panama; Piper; Seedling; Soil; Tiliaceae; Tropical Climate; Water; Weather",,"water, 7732-18-5; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Ashton, P.M.S., Some measurements of the microclimate within a Sri-Lankan tropical rainforest (1992) Agr for Meteorol, 59, pp. 217-235; Augspurger, C.K., Light requirements of neotropical tree seedlings: A comparative study of growth and survival (1984) J Ecol, 72, pp. 777-795; Becker, P., Monthly average solar radiation in Panama - Daily and hourly relations between direct and global insolation (1987) Solar Energy, 39, pp. 445-453; Becker, P., Seasonality of rainfall and drought in Brunei Darussalam (1992) Brunei Mus J, 7, pp. 99-109; Becker, P., Rabenold, P.E., Idol, J.R., Smith, A.P., Water potential gradients for gaps and slopes in a Panamanian tropical moist forest's dry season (1988) J Trop Ecol, 4, pp. 173-184; Bond, W.J., Honig, M., Maze, K.E., Seed size and seedling emergence: An allometric relationship and some ecological implications (1999) Oecologia, 120, pp. 132-136; Brandani, A., Hartshorn, G.S., Orians, G.H., Internal heterogeneity of gaps and species richness in Costa Rican tropical wet forest (1988) J Trop Ecol, 4, pp. 99-109; Brokaw, N.V.L., Gap-phase regeneration of three pioneer tree species in a tropical forest (1987) J Ecol, 75, pp. 9-19; Brown, N.D., The implications of climate and gap microclimate for seedling growth conditions in a Bornean lowland rainforest (1993) J Trop Ecol, 9, pp. 153-168; Brown, N.D., Whitmore, T.C., Do dipterocarp seedlings really partition tropical rain forest gaps?

Box 968, S. Burlington, VT 05402, United States","In tropical moist forests, seasonal drought limits plant survival, productivity and diversity. Drought-tolerance mechanisms of tropical species should reflect the maximum seasonal water deficits experienced in a particular habitat. We investigated stem xylem vulnerability to cavitation in nine tropical species with different life histories and habitat associations. Stem xylem vulnerability was scored as the xylem water potential causing 50 and 75% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P50 and P75, respectively). Four shade-tolerant shrubs ranged from moderately resistant (P50 = -1.9 MPa for Ouratea lucens Kunth. Engl.) to highly resistant to cavitation (P50 = -4.1 MPa for Psychotria horizontalis Sw.), with shallow-rooted species being the most resistant. Among the tree species, those characteristic of waterlogged soils, Carapa guianensis Aubl., Prioria copaifera Griseb. and Ficus citrifolia Mill., were the most vulnerable to cavitation (P50 = -0.8 to -1.6 MPa). The wet-season, deciduous tree, Cordia alliodora (Ruiz & Pav.) Oken., had resistant xylem (P50 = -3.2 MPa), whereas the dry-season, deciduous tree, Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg. was among the most vulnerable to cavitation (P50 = -0.8 MPa) of the species studied. For eight out of the nine study species, previously reported minimum seasonal leaf water potentials measured in the field during periods of drought correlated with our P50 and P75 values. Rooting depth, deciduousness, soil type and growth habit might also contribute to desiccation tolerance. Our results support the functional dependence of drought tolerance on xylem resistance to cavitation. © 2005 Heron Publishing.","Drought tolerance; Hydraulic conductivity; Tropical rainforest; Water potential; Water stress; Xylem cavitation","water; cavitation; drought resistance; interspecific variation; tropical forest; water stress; xylem; article; histology; season; species difference; tree; tropic climate; xylem; Seasons; Species Specificity; Trees; Tropical Climate; Water; Xylem; Bursera simaruba; Burseraceae; Carapa guianensis; Cordia; Cordia alliodora; Ficus citrifolia; Ouratea lucens; Prioria copaifera; Psychotria; Psychotria horizontalis",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Becker, P., Castillo, A., Root architecture of shrubs and saplings in the understory of a tropical moist forest in lowland Panama (1990) Biotropica, 22, pp. 242-249; Borchert, R., Soil and stem water storage determine phenology and distribution of tropical dry forest trees (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1437-1449; Brodribb, T.J., Feild, T.S., Stem hydraulic supply is linked to leaf photosynthetic capacity: Evidence from New Caledonian and Tasmanian rainforests (2000) Plant Cell Environ., 23, pp. 1381-1388; Brodribb, T.J., Hoolbrook, N.M., Gutíerrez, M.V., Hydraulic and photosynthetic coordination in seasonally dry tropical forests trees (2002) Plant Cell Environ., 25, pp. 1435-1444; Brodribb, T.J., Hoolbrook, N.M., Edwards, E.J., Gutíerrez, M.V., Relations between stomatal closure, leaf turgor and xylem vulnerability in eight tropical dry forest trees (2003) Plant Cell Environ., 26, pp. 443-450; Bucci, S.J., Scholz, F.G., Goldstein, G., Meinzer, F.C., Hinojosa, J.A., Hoffmann, W.A., Franco, A.C., Processes preventing nocturnal equilibration between leaf and soil water potential in tropical savanna woody species (2004) Tree Physiol., 24, pp. 1119-1127; Cochard, H., Cruiziat, P., Tyree, M.T., Use of positive pressure to establish vulnerability curves.

Herbivore selection on young leaves has given rise to a variety of leaf developmental strategies and age-specific chemical defense modes. We are studying correlations between leaf developmental types and chemical defenses in the Neotropical genus Inga. We have characterized defense metabolites in Inga goldmanii and Inga umbellifera, two species that co-occur in the lowland moist forest of Panama. These congeners have markedly different young-leaf developmental phenotypes but suffer approximately equal rates of herbivory. Bioassays of whole and fractionated leaf extracts using larvae of Heliothis virescens show that I. goldmanii chemical defenses are nearly three times more inhibitory than those of I. umbellifera. In both species, most of the inhibitory activity resides in complex mixtures of monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols. This group comprises >30% of young leaf dry weight in both I. goldmanii and I. umbellifera. The species' phenolic chemistry differs markedly, however, both in the structure of the monomeric units and in the distribution of polymer sizes. The differences in chemical structure have pronounced effects on their bioactivities, with I. goldmanii flavans being twice as inhibitory to H. virescens larvae as I. umbellifera flavans, and more than three times more efficient at protein binding. Given the extraordinarily high polyphenol concentrations that are found in the young leaves of these species, protein precipitation could be an important mechanism of growth inhibition. Nevertheless, our data show that another mode of phenolic action, possibly oxidative stress, occurs simultaneously. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","Bioactivity; Bioassay; Condensed tannin; Epicatechin- 4β→8-catechin-4α→8-epicatechin; Flavan-3-ol glycoside; Heliothis virescens; Inga goldmanii; Inga umbellifera; Phenolic; Polyphenol; Procyanidin; Protein precipitation","flavan 3 ol; flavan-3-ol; flavonoid; phenol derivative; plant extract; bioassay; chemical defense; phenolic compound; animal; article; bioassay; chemistry; drug effect; growth, development and aging; larva; legume; Lepidoptera; metabolism; Panama; phenotype; physiology; protein binding; species difference; tropic climate; Animals; Biological Assay; Fabaceae; Flavonoids; Larva; Lepidoptera; Panama; Phenols; Phenotype; Plant Extracts; Protein Binding; Species Specificity; Tropical Climate; Heliothis virescens; Inga; Inga umbellifera",,"flavan-3-ol; Flavonoids; Phenols; Plant Extracts",,,,"Bate-Smith, E.C., The phenolic constituents of plants and their taxonomic significance: I.

We compared herbivory and defenses of young leaves for I. goldmanii, a more derived species that follows a ""defense"" strategy, and I. umbellifera, a more basal species that follows an ""escape"" strategy. The two species suffered similar rates of herbivory (22% of the leaf area eaten during expansion) but were attacked by different communities of herbivores. I. goldmanii relied heavily on extra-floral nectaries and on a diversity of effective secondary metabolites, while I. umbellifera minimized damage through rapid leaf expansion and synchronous flushing. The major classes of secondary compounds in both species were flavanoids and non-protein amino acids; however, there were large differences in structure, biosynthetic pathways, and efficacy against herbivores. Growth rates of lepidopteran larvae were significantly lower when fed artificial diets with crude extracts from I. goldmanii as compared to I. umbellifera. Flavanoids accounted for the majority of growth reduction in both species. I. umbellifera had more unusual flavanoids and a non-protein amino acid not reported from plants, but the more common flavanoids found in I. goldmanii were more bioactive against herbivores. I. goldmanii also had greater ant visitation to extrafloral nectaries, suggesting that there was no trade-off between biotic and chemical defenses. In contrast, young leaves of I. umbellifera expanded more rapidly, minimizing the window of vulnerability before toughening. Resources for rapid expansion may have been reallocated from chloroplast development as I. umbellifera delayed the greening process until after full leaf expansion. Leaves were also produced synchronously, which can satiate herbivores and reduce damage. These defense differences, are reflected in almost completely nonoverlapping herbivore faunas and the more frequent occurrence of generalists on I. umbellifera. To understand why defenses have evolved, it is important to view them in light of the herbivore community as well as in the context of the other co-occurring traits. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of chemical defenses determines whether a species follows the evolutionary path of ""defense"" or ""escape"" strategies. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Barro Colorado Island; Bioassays; Flavanoids; Heliothis; Herbivory; Inga; Leaf development; Non-protein amino acids; Phoebis; Plant defenses","antiherbivore defense; chemical defense; leaf; plant-herbivore interaction; secondary metabolite; Fabaceae; Formicidae; Heliothis; Inga; Inga umbellifera; Lepidoptera; Phoebis",,,,,,"Aide, T.M., Herbivory as a selective agent on the timing of leaf production in a tropical understory community (1988) Nature, 336, pp. 574-575; Aide, T.M., Patterns of leaf development and herbivory in a tropical understory community (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 455-466; Aide, T.M., Londoño, E., The effects of rapid leaf expansion on the growth and survivorship of a lepidopteran herbivore (1989) Oikos, 55, pp. 66-70; Baker, N., Hardwick, K., Biochemical and physiological aspects of leaf development in cacao (Theobroma cacao).

Drought periods leading to plant stress occur not only in dry forests, but also in moist and even wet forests. We quantified experimentally the effect of drought on survival of first year seedlings of 28 co-occurring tropical woody plant species in the understory of a tropical moist forest. The seedlings were transplanted to plots and subjected to a drought and an irrigation treatment for 22 weeks during the dry season. Drought effects on mortality and wilting behavior varied greatly among species, so that relative survival in the dry treatment ranged from 0% to about 100% of that in the irrigated treatment. Drought stress was the main factor in mortality, causing about 90% (median) of the total mortality observed in the dry treatment. In almost half of the species, the difference in survival between treatments was not significant even after 22 weeks, implying that many of the species are well adapted to drought in this forest. Relative drought survival was significantly higher in species associated with dry habitats than in those associated with wet habitats, and in species with higher abundance on the dry side of the Isthmus of Panama, than in those more abundant on the wet side. These data show that differential species survival in response to drought, combined with variation in soil moisture availability, may be important for species distribution at the local and regional scale in many tropical forests. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Drought performance;

Box 968, Burlington, VT 05402, United States","Plant productivity, distribution and diversity in tropical rain forests correlate with water availability. Water availability is determined by rainfall and also by the available water capacity of the soil. However, while rainfall is recognized as important, linkages between plant distribution and differences among soils in available water capacity have not been demonstrated. One reason for this may be that measurements of soil moisture, such as gravimetric water content, may be overly simplistic. To investigate this, we compared two sites in Panama, Allee and Rio Paja, which have similar rainfall but different plant communities. Soil water release curves were obtained from about -0,1 MPa to - 9 MPa, permitting us to calculate available water capacity. The Rio Paja site had 17% greater available water capacity (between - 0.1 MPa to - 3 MPa), whereas the gravimetric water content at Rio Paja was lower by 16% in rainy season and by 41% at the end of the dry season. Hence soil gravimetric water content and soil available water capacity did not correspond. The results suggest that available water capacity may better predict plant distributions. Hence, whenever possible, available water capacity should be determined in addition to gravimetric water content.

Values for parasite inhibition with known anti-malarial drugs using the PicoGreen® assay were comparable with those determined by the standard method based upon the uptake of 3H-hypoxanthine and the Giemsa stain microscopic technique.

Research Institute, Box 2072, Balboa, Panama","In tropical forests, the majority of damage by herbivores or pathogens occurs on young leaves, yet the patterns of damage and the factors that influence them are poorly known. By measuring damage throughout leaf development and maturation for five species in a Panamanian forest, we showed that leaf toughening, which only occurs over a few days once the leaf is fully expanded, is the main factor decreasing damage in mature leaves. Although rates of damage to young leaves are, on average, orders of magnitude greater than on mature leaves, there is significant interspecific variation in young leaf defenses and in damage rates. In a survey of 55 species of shade-tolerant plants, we found that each species only invested in a subset of the potential defensive mechanisms for young leaves. We measured rates of young leaf expansion, nitrogen content, delayed chloroplast development, synchrony of leaf production and rates of damage in the field. On a subset of 24 species, we also measured phenolic compounds, checked for the presence of saponins and alkaloids, and conducted bioassays using lepidopteran, coleopteran and orthopteran herbivores and four fungal pathogens to test for toxicity of young leaf extracts. Certain combinations of traits repeatedly co-occurred across unrelated species suggesting convergent evolution. We argue that selection has repeatedly led to tradeoffs among defenses such that species fall along an escape/defense continuum. At one extreme are species with a 'defense' strategy, which includes effective chemical defense, slow leaf expansion, normal greening and low rates of damage (less than 20% of the leaf area lost). At the other extreme are 'escape' species which have ineffective chemical defenses and, as a consequence, have high rates of leaf damage, >60% of leaf area lost during expansion. In partial compensation for ineffective chemical defense, these species have very rapid leaf expansion (doubling in area every day) which minimizes the window of vulnerability, delayed chloroplast development (white young leaves) which contain fewer resources, and synchronous leaf production to satiate herbivores. Thus, interspecific variation in young leaf damage rates is explained by differences in defense combinations along this escape/defense continuum. Because apparently beneficial traits such as effective chemical defense and rapid leaf expansion do not occur in the same species, we suggest that physiological constraints limit the defense combinations of any one species to a restricted subset of those observed. However, the defense and escape strategies do not represent different tradeoffs that have equal fitness, as species with the escape syndrome suffer much higher rates of damage. We hypothesize that the escape syndrome arose over evolutionary time among plants that failed to evolve effective secondary metabolites while herbivores succeeded in evolving adaptations to the chemistry of their host plant. Hence the defense syndrome should provide the greatest fitness, whereas the escape syndrome minimizes damage given the failure of the plant's secondary metabolites to provide protection. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effect of dry season drought on survival and leaf-area change of first year seedlings of 28 species of co-occurring woody tropical plants was experimentally quantified in the understory of a tropical moist forest. The seedlings were subjected to a drought or an irrigation treatment in the forest for 22 weeks during the dry season. Drought decreased survival and growth (assessed as leaf-area change) in almost all of the species. Both survival and leaf-area change in the dry treatment ranged fairly evenly from 0% to about 100% of that in the irrigated treatment. In 43% of the species the difference between treatments in survival was not significant even after 22 weeks. In contrast, only three species showed no significant effect of drought on leaf-area change. The effects of drought on species' survival and growth were not correlated with each other, reflecting different strategies in response to drought. Seedling size at the onset of the dry season had no significant effect on species' drought response. Our study is the first to comparatively assess seedling drought resistance in the habitat for a large number of tropical species, and underlines the importance of drought for plant population dynamics in tropical forests.","Growth; Irrigation; Soil moisture; Survival; Tropical moist forest","drought resistance; microhabitat; seedling; soil moisture; tropical forest; adaptation; article; disaster; growth, development and aging; plant; plant leaf; seedling; survival; tropic climate; Adaptation, Physiological; Natural Disasters; Plant Leaves; Plants; Seedling; Survival Analysis; Tropical Climate",,,,,,"An ordinal classification for the families of flowering plants (1998) Ann Miss Bot Gard, 85, pp. 531-553; Becker, P., Seasonality of rainfall and drought in Brunei Darussalam (1992) Brunei Mus J, 7, pp. 99-109; Becker, P., Wong, M., Drought-induced mortality in tropical heath forest (1993) J Trop Sci, 5, pp. 416-417; Becker, P., Rabenold, P.E., Idol, J.R., Smith, A.P., Water potential gradients for gaps and slopes in a Panamanian tropical moist forest's dry season (1988) J Trop Ecol, 4, pp. 173-184; Bongers, F., Poorter, L., Van Rompaey, R.S.A.R., Parren, M.P.E., Distribution of twelve moist forest canopy tree species in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire: Response curves to a climatic gradient (1999) J Veg Sci, 10, pp. 371-382; Boyer, J.S., Plant productivity and environment (1982) Science, 218, pp. 443-448; Brown, N.D., Whitmore, T.C., Do dipterocarp seedlings really partition tropical rain forest gaps?

Pots were watered to field capacity and then dehydrated for 3 to 9 weeks to reach various visual wilting stages, from slightly wilted to dead. Saturated root hydraulic conductance was measured with a high-pressure flowmeter, and whole-stem hydraulic conductance was measured by a vacuum chamber method. Leaf punches (5.6-mm diameter) were harvested for measurement of leaf water potential by a thermocouple psychrometer method and for measurement of fresh and dry weight. In a parallel study, the same five species were studied in a field experiment in the understory of a tropical forest, where these species frequently germinate. Control seedlings were maintained in irrigated plots during a dry season, and experimental plants were grown in similar plots with rain exclusion shelters. Every 2 to 4 weeks, the seedlings were scored for wilt state and survivorship. After a 22-week drought, the dry plots were irrigated for several weeks to verify visual symptoms of death. The field trials were used to rank drought performance of species, and the greenhouse desiccation studies were used to determine the conditions of moribund plants. Our conclusion is that the desiccation tolerance of moribund plants correlated with field assessment of drought-performance for the five species (r2 &gt; 0.94).",,"Dehydration; Drought; Flowmeters; Greenhouse effect; Harvesting; Seed; Thermocouples; Desiccation tolerance; Plants (botany); Angiosperms; Desiccation; Natural Disasters; Panama; Plant Roots; Seasons; Seedling; Species Specificity; Tropical Climate; Water",,"Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Bongers, F., Poorter, L., Van Rompaey, R.S.A.R., Parren, M.P.E., Distribution of twelve moist forest canopy tree species in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire: Response curves to a climatic gradient (1999) J Veg Sci, 10, pp. 371-382; Buckley, R.C., Corlett, R.T., Grubb, P.J., Are the xeromorphic trees of tropical upper montane rain forests drought-resistant?

Research Institute, Apartado 2072, Balboa, Ancón, Panama","In the tropics, seasonally flooded forests (SFF) harbor fewer tree species than terra firme (i.e. non-flooded) forests. The low species diversity of tropical flooded forests has been ascribed to the paucity of species with adaptations to tolerate flooding. To test the hypothesis that flooding is the only factor restricting most species from SFF, we compared plant morphological and physiological responses to flooding in 2-month old seedlings of 6 species common to SFF and 12 species common to terra firme forests. Although flooding impaired growth, total biomass, maximum root length and stomatal conductance in most species, responses varied greatly and were species-specific. For example, after 90 days, flooding reduced leaf area growth by 10-50% in all species, except in Tabebuia, a common species from non-flooded habitats. Similarly, flooding had a 5-45% negative effect on total biomass for all species, except in 1 SFF and 1 terra firme species both of which had more biomass under flooding. A principal component analysis, using the above responses to flooding, provided no evidence that SFF and terra firme species differed in their responses to flooding. Flooding also caused reductions in root growth for most species. Rooting depth and root: shoot ratios were significantly less affected by flooding in SFF than in terra firme species. Although flood tolerance is critical for survival in flooded habitats, we hypothesize that responses to post-flooding events such as drought might be equally important in seasonal habitats.

Fritsch seedlings were performed on potted plants. Pots were watered to field capacity and then dehydrated for 23-46 d to reach various visible wilting stages from slightly-wilted to dead. Root hydraulic conductance, kr, was measured with a high-pressure flow meter and whole-stem hydraulic conductance, kws, was measured by a vacuum chamber method. Leaf punches were harvested for measurement of leaf water potential by a thermo-couple psychrometer and for measurement of fresh-and dry-weight. L. platypus was surprisingly desiccation-tolerant, suggesting that most species of central Panama may be well adapted to the seasonality of rainfall in the region. The slightly-wilted stage corresponded to leaf water potentials and relative water contents of -2.7 MPa and 0.85, respectively, but plants did not die until these values fell to -7.5 MPa and 0.14, respectively. As desiccation proceeded kr and kws declined relative to irrigated controls, but kws was more sensitive to desiccation than kr. Values of kws declined by 70-85% in slightly-wilted to dead plants, respectively. By comparison, kr showed no significant change in slightly-wilted plants and fell by about 50% in plants having severely-wilted to dead shoots.","Desiccation tolerance; Drought resistance; Hydraulic conductance; Licania platypus; Water potential","Dehydration; Hydraulic conductivity; Irrigation; Physiology; Rain; Seed; Desiccation; Forestry; water; adaptation; angiosperm; apoptosis; article; desiccation; disaster; drug effect; Panama; physiology; plant leaf; plant root; plant stem; sweating; temperature; tropic climate; Adaptation, Physiological; Apoptosis; Desiccation; Natural Disasters; Panama; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Stems; Plant Transpiration; Rosales; Temperature; Tropical Climate; Water; Licania platypus; Magnoliophyta",,"Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Buckley, R.C., Corlett, R.T., Grubb, P.J., Are the xeromorphic trees of tropical upper montane rain forests drought-resistant?

Using 26 populations of a broadly distributed plant species, sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), we examined whether sagebrush populations in habitats with a greater prevalence of fungi contained antifungal secondary metabolites on leaf surfaces that were more active and diverse than sagebrush populations in habitats less favorable to fungi. Because moisture and temperature play a key role in the epidemiology of most plant-pathogen interactions, we also examined the relationship between the antifungal activity of secondary metabolites and the climate of a site. We evaluated the antifungal activity of sagebrush secondary metabolites against two fungi, a wild Penicillium sp. and a laboratory yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using a filter-paper disk assay and bioautography. Comparing the 26 sagebrush populations, we found that fungal abundance was a good predictor of both the activity (r2 = 0.36 for Saccharomyces, r2 = 0.37 for Penicillium) and number (r2 = 0.34 for Saccharomyces) of antifungal secondary metabolites. This suggests that selection imposed by fungal pathogens has led to more effective antifungal secondary metabolites. We found that the antifungal activity of sagebrush secondary metabolites was negatively related to average vapor pressure deficit of the habitat (r2 = 0.60 for Saccharomyces, r2 = 0.61 for Penicillium). Differences in antifungal activity among populations were not due to the amount of secondary metabolites, but rather to qualitative differences in the composition of antifungal compounds. Although all populations in habitats with high fungal prevalence had secondary metabolites with high antifungal activity, different suites of compounds were responsible for this activity, suggesting independent outcomes of selection on plants by fungal pathogens. The location of antifungal secondary metabolites on the leaf surface is consistent with their putative defense role, and we found no evidence supporting other functions, such as protection from ultraviolet light or oxidation. That the antifungal activity of sagebrush secondary metabolites was similar for two different fungi provides support for broad antifungal defenses. The incidence and severity of fungal disease in the field (caused by Puccinia tanaceti) were similar in moist and dry habitats, possibly reflecting an equilibrium between plant defense and fungal attack, as sites with greater fungal abundance compensated with more effective secondary metabolites. The geographic correlation between fungal abundance and antifungal secondary metabolites of sagebrush, coupled with our other data showing heritable variation in these metabolites, suggests that pathogenic fungi have selected for antifungal secondary metabolites in sagebrush.","Artemisia tridentata; Plant defenses; Plant-pathogen interactions; Puccinia tanaceti; Selective pressures; Sesquiterpene lactones; Trichomes","antifungal agent; plant extract; fungus; host-pathogen interaction; plant defense; secondary metabolite; antifungal activity; Artemisia; artemisia tridentata; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease severity; drug effect; fungus; geography; herbivory; human; incidence; leaf surface; metabolism; microbiology; moisture; nonhuman; oxidation; pathogenicity; Penicillium; physiology; plant defense; plant disease; plant environment interaction; plant leaf; prevalence; puccinia tanaceti; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; temperature; ultraviolet radiation; United States; Antifungal Agents; Artemisia; Humans; Incidence; Penicillium; Plant Diseases; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Prevalence; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Utah; Artemisia; Artemisia tridentata; Fungi; Penicillium; Penicillium sp.; Puccinia; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Tridentata",,"Antifungal Agents; Plant Extracts",,,,"Anderson, A.J., Preformed resistance mechanisms (1982) Phytopathogenic Prokaryotes, pp. 119-137. , M.

To estimate habitat favorability to fungi, we examined the relationship of fungal abundance and species richness to various weather and environmental parameters in the Intermountain West. We cultured fungi from air and leaf surfaces, and collected continuous temperature and relative humidity measures over the growing season at 25 sites. Results: Fungal richness was positively correlated with fungal abundance (r = 0.75). Measures of moisture availability, such as relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit, explained more of the variance in fungal abundance and richness than did temperature. Climate measurements from nearby weather stations were good predictors of fungal abundance and richness but not as good as weather measurements obtained in the field. Weather variables that took into account the proportion of time habitats experienced favorable or unfavorable relative humidity and temperatures were the best predictors, explaining up to 56% of the variation in fungal abundance and 72% for fungal richness. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the abundance and richness of fungi in a habitat is limited by the duration of unfavorable weather conditions. Because fungal pathogens likely have similar abiotic requirements for growth as other fungi, characterizing weather conditions favorable for fungi also may be used to predict the selective pressures imposed by pathogenic fungi on plants in different habitats. © 2002 Talley et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Fungi; ecosystem; environment; fungus; growth, development and aging; humidity; isolation and purification; microbiology; plant; plant leaf; United States; weather; Air Microbiology; Ecosystem; Environment; Fungi; Humidity; Plant Leaves; Plants; Soil Microbiology; Southwestern United States; Weather",,,,,,"Jones, D., (1998) The Epidemilogy of Plant Diseases, , Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Van Der Plank, J.E., (1975) Principles of Plant Infection, , New York: Academic Press; Froelich, R.C., Snow, G.A., Predicting site hazard to fusiform rust (1986) For Sci, 32, pp. 21-35; Burdon, J.J., (1987) Diseases and Plant Population Biology, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Dix, N.J., Webster, J., (1995) Fungal Ecology, , New York: Chapman and Hall; Garcia-Guzman, G., Burdon, J.J., Ash, J.E., Cummingham, R.B., Regional and local patterns in the spatial distribution of the flower-infecting smut fungus Sporisorium amphilophis in natural populations of its host Bothriochloa macra (1996) New Phytol, 132, pp. 459-468; Burdon, J.J., Fungal pathogens as selective forces in plant populations and communities (1991) Aust J Ecol, 16, pp. 423-432; Nan, Z.B., Skipp, R.A., Long, P.G., Fungal invasion of red clover roots in a soil naturally infested with a complex of pathogens: Effects of soil temperature and moisture content (1991) Soil Biol Biochem, 23, pp. 415-422; Schmiedeknecht, M., Environmental tolerance range of Meliolales as mirrored in their horizontal and vertical distribution patterns (1995) Microbiol Res, 150, pp. 271-280; Venier, L.A., Hopkin, A.A., McKenney, D.W., Wang, Y., A spatial, climate-deterimined risk rating for Scleroderris disease of pines of Ontario (1998) Can J for Res, 28, pp. 1398-1404; Huber, L., Gillespie, T.J., Modeling leaf wetness in relation to plant disease epidemiology (1993) Ann Rev Phytopath, 30, pp. 553-577; Cooke, R.C., Whipps, J.M., (1993) Ecophysiology of Fungi, , Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications; Harrison, J.G., Lowe, R., Williams, N.A., Humidity and fungal diseases of plants - Problems (1994) Ecology of Plant Pathogens, pp. 79-97. , (Edited by: JP Blakeman, B Williamson) Wallingford: CAB International; Agrios, G.N., (1978) Plant Pathology, , New York: Academic Press; Griffin, D.H., (1994) Fungal Physiology, , Newy York: Wiley-Liss; Colhoun, J., Effects of environmental factors on plant disease (1973) Annu Rev Phytopath, 11, pp. 343-363; Taylor, E.C., Seasonal distribution and abundance of fungi in two desert grassland communities (1979) J Arid Environ, 2, pp. 295-312; Rowan, N.J., Johnstone, C.M., McLean, R.C., Anderson, J.G., Clarke, J.A., Prediction of toxigenic fungal growth in buildings by using a novel modelling system (1999) Appl Environ Microbiol, 65, pp. 4814-4821; Juniper, B.E., The leaf from the inside and the outside: A microbe's perspective (1991) Microbial Ecology of Leaves, pp. 21-42. , (Edited by: JH Andrews, SS Hirano) New York: Springer-Verlag; Johansen, J.R., Rushforth, S.R., Cryptogamic soil crusts: Seasonal variation in algal populations in the Tintic Mountains, Juab county, Utah (1985) Great Basin Nat, 45, pp. 14-21; Ricklefs, R.E., (1990) Ecology, , New York: W.

Research now shows that dominance is not the result of one trait or mechanism. We suggest that the striking dominance of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Congo is the result of a number of traits in adult trees that significantly modify the understory environment, making it difficult for other species to regenerate there. Adults cast deep shade that reduces light levels in the understory of the Gilbertiodendron forest to levels significantly lower than in the mixed-species forest. Moreover, the monodominant forest has deep leaf litter that could inhibit the establishment of small-seeded species, and the leaf litter is slow to decompose, potentially causing the low availability of nitrogen. We expect that juveniles of Gilbertiodendron may have an advantage in this environment over other species. In general, it appears that all tropical monodominant species share a similar suite of traits.","Africa; Gilbertiodendron; Ituri forest; Monodominance","canopy; dominance; leaf litter; life history trait; shading; tropical forest; Congo; Gilbertiodendron dewevrei",,,,,,"Anderson, J.M., Proctor, J., Vallack, H.W., Ecological studies in four contrasting lowland rain forests in Gunong Mulu National Park, Sarawak.

Endophytes have been found in every plant species examined to date and may be important, but often overlooked, components of fungal biodiversity. In two sites in a lowland, moist tropical forest of central Panama, we quantified endophyte colonization patterns, richness, host preference, and spatial variation in healthy leaves of two co-occurring, understory tree species [Heisteria concinna (Olacaceae) and Ouratea lucens (Ochnaceae)]. From 83 leaves, all of which were colonized by endophytes, we isolated 418 endophyte morphospecies (estimated 347 genetically distinct taxa), most of which were represented by only a single isolate (59%). Among morphospecies encountered in more than one leaf (nonsingletons), we found evidence of host preference and spatial heterogeneity using both morphospecies frequencies and presence/absence records. Based on these data, we postulate that tropical endophytes themselves may be hyperdiverse and suggest that extrapolative estimates that exclude them will markedly underestimate fungal species diversity.","Barro Colorado Island; Fungal endophytes; Host preference; Jaccard's index; Ochnaceae; Olacaceae; Panama; Tropical forests","biodiversity; endophyte; fungus; tropical forest; Panama; Heisteria concinna; Ouratea lucens",,,,,,"Aptroot, A., Species diversity in tropical rainforest ascomycetes: Lichenized vs. non-lichenized; foliicolous vs. corticolous (1997) Abstracta Bot., 21, pp. 37-44; Bernstein, M.E., Carroll, G.C., Internal fungi in old-growth Douglas fir foliage (1977) Can.

This impressive diversity of plant compounds suggests a high probability of interactions among them. Synergistic interactions are those in which the combined activity of two or more chemicals is greater than that expected given their individual activities. On the other hand, antagonistic interactions are those in which the combined activity of two or more chemicals is less than that expected given their individual activities. Synergistic interactions could increase plant fitness whereas antagonistic interactions could decrease plant fitness. Interactions are thus potentially very important, not only in explaining the diversity of defense compounds within individual plants, but also in providing insight into plant defense strategies. Although synergistic interactions have received increased attention in the ecological literature in the last decade, the number of documented cases of synergy remains small and antagonistic interactions are rarely considered. The primary reason for this scarcity may be the difficulty of detecting, analyzing and displaying such interactions. Analysis by ANOVA, though sometimes used, often is not appropriate. We introduce a simple technique, isobolographic analysis, that is used in pharmacology for detecting and rigorously quantifying synergy and antagonism and provide an example using the brine shrimp toxicity assay. More statistically sophisticated approaches, such as isobolographic analysis, will allow ecologists to effectively document the role of chemical synergy and antagonism in interactions between species. Such chemical interactions may ultimately provide insight into longstanding, ecological questions.",,,,,,,,"Aide, T.M., Patterns of leaf development and herbivory in a tropical understory community (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 455-466; Aiello, A., Fattorusso, E., Menna, M., Four new bioactive polyhydroxylated sterols from the black coral Antipathes subpinnata (1992) J Nat Prod, 55, pp. 321-325; Albrizio, S., Fattorusso, E., Magno, S., Mangoni, A., Linear diterpenes from the Caribbean sponge, Myrmekioderma styx (1992) J Nat Prod, 55, pp. 1287-1293; Anderson, J.E., Wenwen, M., Smith, D.L., Chang, C.J., McLaughlin, J.L., Biologically active α-lactones and methylketoalkenes from Lindera benzoin (1992) J Nat Prod, 55, pp. 71-83; Appel, U.M., Phenolics in ecological interactions: The importance of oxidation (1993) J Chem Ecol, 19, pp. 1521-1552; Applebaum, S.W., Birk, Y., Saponins (1979) Herbivores: Their Interactions with Secondary Plant Metabolites, pp. 539-566. , Rosenthal GA, Janzen DH (eds) New York: Academic Press; Berenbaum, M.C., What is synergy?

Here we examine both leaf-level and whole-plant responses to simulated light gap formation by two common shade-tolerant shrubs, Hybanthus prunifolius and Ouratea lucens. The species were chosen because they differed in leaf lifespans, a trait that has been correlated with a number of leaf- and plant-level processes. Ouratea leaves typically live about 5 years, while Hybanthus leaves live less than 1 year. Potted plants were placed in the understory shade for 2 years before transfer to a light gap. After 2 days in high light, leaves of both species showed substantial photoinhibition, including reduced CO2 fixation, F(v)/F(m) and light use efficiency, although photoinhibition was most severe in Hybanthus. After 17 days in high light, leaves of both species were no longer photoinhibited. In response to increased light, Ouratea made very few new leaves, but retained most of its old leaves which increased photosynthetic capacity by 50%. Within a few weeks of transfer to high light, Hybanthus had dropped nearly all of its shade leaves and made new leaves that had a 2.5-fold greater light-saturated photosynthetic rate. At 80 days after transfer, the number of new leaves was 4.9-fold the initial leaf number. After 80 days in high light, Hybanthus had approximately tenfold greater productivity than Ouratea when leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and leaf dark respiration rate were all taken into account. Although both species are considered shade tolerant, we found that their growth responses were quite different following transfer from low to high light. The short-lived Hybanthus leaves were quickly dropped, and a new canopy of sun leaves was produced. In contrast, Ouratea showed little growth response at the whole-plant level, but a greater ability to tolerate light stress and acclimate at the leaf level. These differences are consistent with predictions based on leaf lifespan and are discussed within the context of other traits associated with shade-tolerant syndromes.","Leaf angle; Leaf lifespan; Quantum yield; Shade tolerance; Tropical","acclimation; canopy gap; growth response; light intensity; physiological response; understory; Hybanthus prunifolius; Ouratea lucens",,,,,,"Ackerly, D.D., Canopy structure and dynamics: Integration of growth processes in tropical pioneer trees (1996) Tropical Forest Plant Ecophysiology, pp. 619-658. , Mulkey SS, Chazdon RL, Smith AP (eds)Chapman & Hall, New York; Bradshaw, A.D., Evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in plants (1965) Adv Genet, 13, pp. 115-155; Brokaw, N.V.L., Scheiner, S.M., Species composition in gaps and structure of a tropical forest (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 538-541; Canham, C.D., Different responses to gaps among shade-tolerant tree species (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 548-550; Chapin F.S.

We compared morphological and physiological responses to flooding in seedlings of Prioria copaifera Griseb., a species that forms monodominant stands in seasonally flooded habitats, and in three species confined to flood-free sites; namely, Calophyllum longifolium Willd., Virola surinamensis Aubl. and Gustavia superba (H.B.K.) Berg. Flooding reduced photosynthesis at Day 45 in all species by 10-30%. By Day 90, photosynthesis returned to the control rate in Prioria, but not in the other species. Flooding reduced stomatal conductance by 25-35% in all species except Calophyllum, and it reduced leaf area growth by 44% in Virola, but not in the other species. All species survived 90 days of flooding without mortality, leaf chlorosis, leaf necrosis, or leaf abscission. Flooding reduced root:shoot ratio significantly in Gustavia and Calophyllum, but not in the other species, and it reduced maximum root depth by 29% in Prioria, but by 61% or more in the species from flood-free habitats.","Calophyllum longifolium; Floodplains; Gustavia superba; Monodominance; Panama; Prioria copaifera; Root growth; Seasonality; Tropical forests; Virola surinamensis","comparative study; flood; growth response; morphology; physiological response; tolerance; tree; tropical environment; Calophyllum longifolium; Gustavia superba; Prioria copaifera; Virola surinamensis",,,,,,"Albrecht, G., Wiedenroth, E.-M., Protection against activated oxygen following re-aeration of hypoxically pretreated wheat roots.

Shade-tolerant species that coexist in the forest understory exhibit differences in leaf life span that have been associated with variation in physiological traits. We hypothesized that water relations of understory species with widely divergent leaf life spans differ in response to drought. Although severe drought is infrequent in Neotropical moist forest, we studied the water relations of shade-tolerant understory species with short or long leaf life spans during the severe 1991-1992 dry season on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The predawn leaf water potential declined to -2.8 and -3.6 MPa during the dry season in Hybanthus prunifolius and Psychotria horizontalis, respectively, two species with short leaf life spans, but remained above - 1.3 MPa in two species with long leaf life spans, Swartzia simplex and Ouratea lucens. The midday leaf water potential dropped as low as -3.4 and -4.5 MPa for H. prunifolius and P. horizontalis, respectively. The osmotic potential of H. prunifolius and P. horizontalis and another species with short leaf life span, Alseis blackiana, decreased early in the dry season, a period during which all three had substantially negative predawn water potential. In contrast, the osmotic potential of S. Simplex, O. lucens, and Licania platypus, a third species with long leaf life span, declined late in the dry season, even though we observed little change in predawn water potential for S. simplex and O. lucens. We conclude that the variable and potentially severe dry season in Neotropical moist forest can be sufficiently intense to severely limit soil moisture availability for understory plants. H. prunifolius and P. horizontalis tolerated dehydration, whereas S. simplex and O. lucens postponed dehydration.","Drought; Leaf life span; Leaf water potential; Panama; Pressure-volume curves; Tropical moist forest; Water relations","drought resistance; drought stress; physiological response; understory; water relations; Panama; Hybanthus prunifolius; Ouratea lucens; Psychotria horizontalis; Swartzia simplex",,,,,,"Aide, T.M., (1989) The Relationship between Leaf Phenology and Herbivory in a Tropical Understory Community, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Zimmerman, J.K., Patterns of insect herbivory, growth, and survivorship in juveniles of a Neotropical liana (1990) Ecology, 71, pp. 1412-1421; Augspurger, C.K., Light requirements of Neotropical tree seedlings: A comparative study of growth and survival (1984) J.

We employ a combination of approaches including technology transfer to Panama, the development of Panama's scientific infrastructure for drug and gene discovery, the training of Panamanian scientists, the involvement of seven Panamanian laboratories in research, and the equitable sharing of revenues among a diversity of Panamanian institutions. In Panama, we will conduct assays to detect activity against cancer, HIV, malaria, Trypanosoma cruzi (the causative agent of Chagas' disease), leishmaniasis and agricultural pests. Monsanto Company will also test samples in their pharmaceutical and agricultural screens, provide NMR spectra, as well as provide training for Panamanian scientists. Any royalties or milestones received from commercialization will be shared among (i) a fund of the Panamanian government that supports the national park system, (ii) a Panamanian foundation funding conservation and sustainable development projects, and (iii) the three collaborating scientific institutions. In collaboration with Conservation International, we will help indigenous communities record their ethnobotanical traditions and provide educational and internship programs for indigenous participants. For collecting biological materials, we employ the use of novel ecological criteria to increase the probability of discovering active compounds. Our data suggest that the application of ecological principles to the collecting of plants, insects and fungi will provide samples with greater activity in biological assays than samples collected at random. Using ecological insight for collection, promoting infrastructure development, and returning benefits to a broad range of institutions will have maximal impact on conservation both in the short- and long-term.","Beetles; Cancer; Conservation; Endophytic fungi; HIV; Intellectual property; Leishmaniasis; Malaria; Plants; Trypanosoma","drug; agriculture; article; bioassay; biodiversity; fungus; gene; insect; Panama; plant; Coleoptera; Fungi; Hexapoda; Insecta; Trypanosoma; Trypanosoma cruzi",,,,,,"Arnold, A.E., Maynard, Z., Gilbert, G.S., Coley, P.D., Kursar, T.A., Are tropical endophytic fungi hyperdiverse?

Shade-tolerant species that inhabit the understorey have a range of leaf lifetimes (from 1 to 8 years), which may indicate a variety of strategies for dealing with increases in light associated with tree-fall gaps. We hypothesized that species with long-lived leaves should be more tolerant of an increase in light levels than species with short-lived leaves. 2. In understorey plants of 12 shade-tolerant rain-forest species, photoinhibition, measured as a reduction in the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter F(v)/F(m) when leaf discs were exposed to 1 h at 1000 μmol m-2s-1, was greater in species with short-lived leaves than species with long-lived leaves. 3. Less photoinhibition in species with long-lived leaves was not associated with higher levels of non-photochemical dissipation (NPQ) of absorbed light, but may be the result of a higher yield of photosystem II compared with short-lived leaves. 4. Thus, species with long-lived leaves are more tolerant of abrupt increases in light that occur when tree-fall gaps are formed than species with short-lived leaves. 5. Discs from leaves of all species growing in tree-fall gaps had higher levels of NPQ, yield of photosystem II and more rapid recovery from photoinhibition than leaves developed in the understorey; however, there were no differences among species with short- and long-lived leaves.","Acclimation in shade-tolerant species; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Leaf lifetimes; Tolerance of high light levels","leaf; longevity; photoinhibition; tropical forest; understory",,,,,,"Bilger, W., Björkman, O., Role of the xanthophyll cycle in photoprotection elucidated by measurements of light induced absorbance changes, fluorescence and photosynthesis in leaves of Hedera canariensis (1990) Photosynthesis Research, 25, pp. 173-185; Grime, J.P., (1979) Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes, , Wiley, Chichester; Haupt, W., Scheuerlein, R., Chloroplast movement (1990) Plant, Cell and Environment, 13, pp. 565-602; Kitajima, K., Relative importance of photosynthetic traits and allocation patterns as correlates of seedling shade tolerance of 13 tropical trees (1994) Oecologia, 98, pp. 419-428; Königer, M., Harris, G.C., Virgo, A., Winter, K., Xanthophyll-cycle pigments and photosynthetic capacity in tropical forest species: A comparative field study on gap, canopy and understory plants (1995) Oecologia, 104, pp. 280-290; Krall, J.P., Edwards, G.E., Relationship between photosystem II activity and CO2 fixation in leaves (1992) Physiologia Plantarum, 86, pp. 180-187; Krause, G.H., Weis, E., Chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis: The basics (1991) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 42, pp. 301-313; Krause, G.H., Winter, K., Photoinhibition of photosynthesis in plants growing in natural tropical forest gaps.

Climate change during the next hundred years will be more similar to climate fluctuations that have occurred in the last few thousand years and of a much smaller magnitude than the extent of climate change experienced during last glaciation or at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Unfortunately, the extent to which tropical rainforest tree communities have changed during the last few thousand years has been little investigated. As a consequence we lack the detailed evidence for population and range shifts of individual tropical species resulting from climate change analogous to the evidence available for temperate zone forests. Some evidence suggests that the rate of tropical forest change in the last several thousand years may have been high. If so, then CO2 increases and the likely alterations in temperature, forest turnover rate, rainfall, or severe droughts may drive substantial future forest change. How can we predict or model the effects of climate change on a highly diverse tree community? Explanations for the regulation of tropical tree populations often invoke tree physiology or processes that are subject to physiological regulation such as herbivory, pathology or seed production. In order to incorporate such considerations into climate change models, the physiology of a very diverse tree community must be understood. My work has focused on simplifying this diversity by categorizing the shade-tolerant species into functional physiological groups. Most species and most individual trees are shade-tolerant species, gap-requiring species being relatively uncommon. Additionally, in a regenerating gap most of the individuals are shade-tolerant species that established before gap formation. Despite the fact that the shade-tolerant species are of major ecological importance, their comparative physiology has received little attention. I have found that shade-tolerant species differ substantially in their responses to light flecks, treefall light gaps and drought. Furthermore, among phylogenetically unrelated species, these differences in physiology can be predicted from leaf lifetime. These results provide a general framework for understanding the mechanics of tropical rainforests from a physiological perspective that can be used to model their responses to climate change.",,"climate change; ecophysiology; plant community; rainforest; tree; tropical forest; vegetation dynamics",,,,,,"Anderson, J.M., Osmond, C.B., Shade-Sun Responses: Compromises between Acclimation and Photoinhibition (1987) Photoinhibition, pp. 1-38. , Kyle, D.

We investigated the capacity of eight shade-tolerant species to use light flecks by examining the time required for full induction of photosynthesis during an artificial light fleck. CO2 fixation rates were measured with a portable LiCor gas-exchange system for plants growing in the field on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. In all species induction to 50% of maximum CO2 fixation occurred quickly, from 1 to 3 min. In species with short leaf lifetimes (1 year), induction to 90% of maximum also occurred quickly, in 3-6 min. In contrast, the species with longer lived leaves (&gt;4 years) required 11-36 min for induction to 90% of maximum. Induction times for leaves from gap and understory plants of the same species were indistinguishable. Elevated CO2 did not eliminate the slow induction phase of long-lived leaves. This suggests that slow induction did not result from stomatal limitation. O2 evolution, measured on excised leaf disks, induced in 3-4 min in species with short-lived leaves, and 4-8 min in species with long-lived leaves. The rapid induction of O2 evolution indicates that the slower induction of CO2 fixation in long-lived leaves was not caused by a delay in the induction of electron transport. Activation of rubisco may be the major factor limiting response times in species with long-lived leaves. Species from Panama with short-lived leaves had remarkably rapid induction times that are comparable to those of algae or higher plant chloroplasts. We also found that understory forest plants induced two to seven times more quickly than did potted plants. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Induction; Leaf lifespan; Light flecks; Photosynthesis; Rainforest",,,,,,,"Aide TM (1989) The relationship between leaf phenology and herbivory in a tropical understory community.

In these species, there is a delay of the normal greening process until after leaves have fully expanded and have begun to toughen. Delayed greening involves a delay in the input of chlorophyll, rubisco, nitrogen, and energy. Photosynthetic capacity is therefore lower than in species with normal greening. At full expansion, leaves begin to toughen quickly, and rates of herbivory drop by a factor of 4. Delayed greening may have evolved as a mechanism for minimizing losses to herbivores by delaying input of valuable resources until after the leaf is fully expanded and better protected by toughness. These benefits outweigh the costs of forfeited photosynthesis in the shaded understory but not in the high light treefall gaps. This cost evaluation suggests that, in the face of herbivory, it is advantageous to have delayed greening in the shade and normal development in the sun. Data from 175 of the most common tree species on Barro Colorado Island confirm that delayed greening is extremely common in shade tolerant species and rare in gap specialists. -Authors",,"antiherbivore defence; phenology; photosynthesis; Panama, Barro Colorado Island",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00063606,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027088168

Implications of this delayed greening pattern for photosynthesis were studied in gap and understorey species in Panama. For three species with delayed greening, young leaves had three times less Rubisco and two-fold lower rates of O2 evolution than two species with normal greening. Species with delayed greening were not at photosynthetic compensation under saturating light until the leaves were fully expanded. Thirty additional days were required for full maturation of the photosynthetic apparatus. After the leaves with delayed greening were fully expanded, the rate of dark respiration was 5-10 times higher than that of mature leaves, possibly due to the metabolic demands of completing chloroplast development. At the end of leaf expansion, species with normal greening had Rubisco contents, CO2 fixation rates, O2 evolution rates and dark respiration rates that were close to those of mature leaves. -from Authors",,"leaf development; photosynthesis; rain forest; Panama",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,02698463,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027070076

Most species had higher N in young compared to mature leaves, but one species showed no change with age. The ratio of N import relative to dry weight import was low (1-4%) and dropped during expansion. The amount of N imported daily into the leaf peaked at 70-75% of full expansion, though species varied in the percent of final N that was imposed prior to full expansion (67-93%). There was a significant positive correlation between N content of young leaves and the rate of leaf expansion.

Ingleside Avenue, Chicago, 60637, Illinois, United States","The temperate seagrass Zostera marina L. is common in coastal marine habitats characterized by the presence of reducing sediments. The roots of this seagrass grow in these anoxic sediments, yet eelgrass is highly productive. Through photosynthesis-dependent oxygen transport from leaves to roots, aerobic respiration is supported in eelgrass roots only during daylight; consequently, roots are subjected to diurnal periods of anoxia. Under anoxic root conditions, the amino acids alanine and γ-amino butyric acid accumulate within a few hours to account for 70% of the total amino acid pool, while glutamate and glutamine decline. Little ethanol is produced, and the pool size of the organic acid malate changes little or declines slowly. Upon the resumption of shoot photosynthesis and oxygen transport to the roots, the accumulated γ-amino butyric acid declines rapidly, glutamate and glutamine pools increase, and alanine declines over a 16-h period. These adaptive metabolic responses by eelgrass to diurnal root anoxia must contribute to the successful exploitation of shallow-water marine sediments that have excluded nearly all vascular plant groups. A metabolic scheme is presented that accounts for the observed changes in organic and amino acid pool sizes in response to anoxia. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,"Backman, T.W., Barilotti, D.C., Irradiance reduction: effects on standing crops of the eelgrass Zostera marina in a coastal lagoon (1976) Mar.
