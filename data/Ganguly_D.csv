Electronic address: veronica.albrecht@anu.edu.au","In recent years many advances have been made to obtain insight into chloroplast biogenesis and development. In plants several plastids types exist such as the proplastid (which is the progenitor of all plastids), leucoplasts (group of colourless plastids important for storage including elaioplasts (lipids), amyloplasts (starch) or proteinoplasts (proteins)), chromoplasts (yellow to orange-coloured due to carotenoids, in flowers or in old leaves as gerontoplasts), and the green chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are indispensable for plant development; not only by performing photosynthesis and thus rendering the plant photoautotrophic, but also for biochemical processes (which in some instances can also take place in other plastids types), such as the synthesis of pigments, lipids, and plant hormones and sensing environmental stimuli. Although we understand many aspects of these processes there are gaps in our understanding of the establishment of functional chloroplasts and their regulation. Why is that so? Even though chloroplast function is comparable in all plants and most of the algae, ferns and moss, detailed analyses have revealed many differences, specifically with respect to its biogenesis. As an update to our prior review on the genetic analysis of chloroplast biogenesis and development [1] herein we will focus on recent advances in Angiosperms (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants) that provide novel insights and highlight the challenges and prospects for unravelling the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis specifically during the establishment of the young plants.

A revertant of the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyhn. chloroplast biogenesis mutant snowy cotyledon 3 (sco3-1) was isolated partially recovering the impaired chloroplast phenotype. The mutation was identified in the Phytochrome B (PhyB) gene and is a result of an amino acid change within the PAS repeat domain required for light-induced nuclear localisation. An independent phyB-9 mutation was crossed into sco3-1 mutants, resulting in the same partial reversion of sco3-1. Further analysis demonstrated that SCO3 and PhyB influence the greening process of seedlings and rosette leaves, embryogenesis, rosette formation and flowering. Interestingly, the functions of these proteins are interwoven in various ways, suggesting a complex genetic interaction. Whole-transcriptome profiling of sco3-1phyB-9 indicated that a completely distinct set of genes was differentially regulated in the double mutant compared with the single sco3-1 or phyB-9 mutants. Thus, we hypothesise that PhyB and SCO3 genetically suppress each other in plant and chloroplast development. © CSIRO 2015.","Arabidopsis thaliana; chloroplast development; gene regulation phytochrome interacting factor 4","chloroplast;
