A phenomenological approach was used. Sixteen HIV positive pregnant women volunteered to participate from June 2005 to June 2006. Data were collected through unstructured multiple in-depth individual interviews, observation, field-note, tape recorded and transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Two patterns emerged: first was a pattern of suffering, secondly, was a pattern of hope. Suffering was caused by fear of condemnation from their spouses, and by fear of disappointing their larger families. Moreover; the suffering was exacerbated by feelings of uncertainty for the sickness in the future, worry about the discrimination and stigmatization of their children, self-blaming and a feeling desperation. Within the pattern of hope, these women hoped for their unborn babies to be healthy and free from HIV infection. Furthermore, they hoped to live as long as possible in order to care for their children, and they hoped that someday they would be accepted by the community and be able to live in harmony. This study formed 2 patterns of the lived experiences among Thai HIV positive pregnant women.

This study reports on a sample of family planning providers (263 mid-level providers, 54 obstetrician-gynaecologists and 88 general physicians) from a 2004 survey of health facilities and their staff in Bihar and Jharkhand, India. It identified factors associated with mid-level provider interest in training for early medical abortion provision, and examined whether obstetrician-gynaecologists and general physicians supported non-physicians being trained to provide early medical abortion and what factors influenced their attitudes. Findings demonstrate high levels of mid-level provider interest and reasonable physician support. Among mid-level providers, being male, having a more permissive attitude towards abortion and current provision of abortion using any pharmacological drugs were associated with greater interest in attending training. Mid-level providers based in private health facilities were less likely to show interest. More permissive attitude towards abortion and current medical abortion provision using mifepristone-misoprostol were inversely associated with obstetrician-gynaecologists' support for non-physician provision of medical abortion. General physicians based in private/other health facilities were less supportive than those in public facilities. Study findings strengthen the case for policymakers to expand the pool of cadres that can legally provide safe abortion care in India. © 2009 Reproductive Health Matters.","India; medical abortion; mid-level providers; task shifting; training of service providers","mifepristone; misoprostol; adult; article; family planning; female; geographic distribution; gynecology; health care delivery; health care facility; health care personnel; human; India; male; medical abortion; medical education; medical specialist; medical staff; physician attitude; priority journal; social support; therapeutic abortion; Abortion, Induced; Adult; Allied Health Personnel; Female; Health Care Surveys; Humans; India; Middle Aged; Pregnancy",,"mifepristone, 84371-65-3; misoprostol, 59122-46-2, 59122-48-4",,,,"Chhabra, R., Nuna, S., (1993) Abortion in India: An Overview, , Veerendra Printers, New Delhi; Mundle, S., Elul, B., Anand, A., Increasing access to safe abortion services in rural India: experiences with medical abortion in a primary health center (2007) Contraception, 76 (1), pp. 66-70; Ganatra, B., Johnston, H.B., Reducing abortion-related mortality in South Asia: a review of constraints and a road map for change (2002) Journal of American Medical Women's Association, 57 (3), pp. 159-164; Hirve, S.S., Abortion law, policy and services in India: a critical review (2004) Reproductive Health Matters, 12 (24 SUPPL), pp. 114-121; (2000) National family health survey-2 India, 1998-99, , International Institute for Population Sciences, IIPS/Mumbai Measure DHS+/ORC Macro, Mumbai/Calverton MD; Peters, D.H., (2002) Better Health Systems for India's Poor: Findings, Analysis, and Options, , World Bank Publications, Washington DC; Johnston, H.B., Ved, R., Lyall, N., Where do rural women obtain postabortion care?

However, recent reports suggest that singleton preterm delivery rates for non-Hispanic Whites are increasing while those for non-Hispanic African Americans are decreasing. To study this pattern further, the authors examined data on singleton non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic African-American births in 1989 and 1999 by using North Carolina vital statistics data. They found that the frequency of preterm delivery rose 1.1% (8.5% to 9.6%) among non-Hispanic Whites but declined 1.4% (17.9% to 16.5%) among non-Hispanic African Americans over the same time period. For both subgroups, a bimodal distribution of birth weights was apparent among preterm births at 28-31 weeks of gestation. The second peak with its cluster of normal-weight infants was more prominent among non-Hispanic African Americans in 1989 than in 1999. To reduce the potential for bias due to misclassification of infant gestational age, frequencies of preterm delivery of infants who weighed less than 2,500 g were calculated. Unlike the original analysis, this calculation showed that preterm delivery increased for both subgroups. A number of non-Hispanic African-American births classified as preterm were apparently term births mistakenly assigned short gestational ages. Such misclassification was more frequent in 1989 than in 1999, inflating 1989 preterm delivery rates.","Bias (epidemiology); Birth certificates; Blacks; Classification; Delivery, obstetric; Gestational age; Infant, premature","pregnancy; African American; article; birth certificate; birth weight; Caucasian; controlled study; gestational age; human; infant; major clinical study; newborn; premature labor; prenatal care; United States; vital statistics; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Bias (Epidemiology); Birth Weight; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; North Carolina; Obstetric Labor, Premature; Pregnancy",,,,,,"State-specific changes in singleton preterm births among black and white women-United States, 1990 and 1997 (2000) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 49, pp. 837-840; Preterm singleton births-United States, 1989-1996 (1999) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 48, pp. 185-189; Alexander, G.R., Himes, J.H., Kaufman, R.B., A United States national reference for foetal growth (1996) Obstet Gynecol, 87, pp. 163-168; Arbuckle, T., Wilkins, R., Sherman, G.J., Birth weight percentiles by gestational age in Canada (1993) Obstet Gynecol, 81, pp. 39-48; David, R.J., The quality and completeness of birthweight and gestational age data in computerized birth files (1980) Am J Public Health, 70, pp. 964-973; Wilcox, A.J., Russell, I.T., Birthweight and perinatal mortality.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of birth outcomes by ethnicity/race, from linked birth/infant death certificates in North Carolina (1993-1997) was conducted. Multivariate, binary logistic regression and χ2 analysis were used to examine relationships between available medical and sociodemographic index values and composite birth outcomes among Hispanic women. RESULTS: Infant mortality rates were lowest among Hispanic women. Low birth weight and prematurity rates were similar to those of white women and lower than those of African American women. Variables significantly related to healthy composite birth outcomes among Hispanic women included higher education, no preterm delivery history, prenatal care, marriage, and no daily tobacco use. CONCLUSION: Hispanic birth outcomes in North Carolina were better than those of African American women and similar to those of white women, despite use of prenatal care and socioeconomic characteristics similar to African American women.","Birth outcomes; Ethnicity; Hispanic; Infant mortality; North Carolina vital statistics","academic achievement; adolescent; adult; article; Caucasian; chi square test; controlled study; correlation analysis; demography; ethnic difference; female; human; infant mortality; logistic regression analysis; low birth weight; major clinical study; marriage; multivariate analysis; outcomes research; premature labor; prematurity; prenatal care; priority journal; race difference; register; retrospective study; smoking; social aspect; socioeconomics; United States; Adult; African Americans; Education; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Infant Mortality; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Marital Status; Medical Records; Multivariate Analysis; Prenatal Care; Smoking",,,,,,"Balcazar, H., Cole, G., Hartner, J., Mexican-Americans' use of prenatal care and its relationship to maternal risk factors and pregnancy outcome (1992) Am J Prev Med, 8, pp. 1-7; Guendelman, S., English, P.B., Effect of United States residence on birth outcomes among Mexican immigrants: An exploratory study (1995) Am J Epidemiol, 142, pp. S30-S38; Zuvekas, A., Wells, B.L., Lefkowitz, B., Mexican American infant mortality rate: Implications for public policy (2000) J Health Care Poor Underserved, 11, pp. 243-257; Rosenberg, H.M., Maurer, J.D., Sorlie, P.D., Johnson, N.J., MacDorman, M.F., Hoyert, D.L., Quality of death rates by race and Hispanic origin: A summary of current research (1999) Vital Health Stat 2, 128, pp. 1-13; Buekens, P., Norton, F., Kotelchuck, M., Wilcox, A., Why do Mexican Americans give birth to few low-birth-weight infants?

Moreover, these ratios have not changed in the past 20 years, and large racial disparities persist in measures of both maternal mortality and morbidity. In an affluent developed country, maternal deaths should serve as rare sentinel events, highlighting opportunities for prevention and reduction of morbidities. However, existing surveillance efforts are poorly developed, and pregnancy-related deaths and illnesses tend to be underreported. To formulate recommendations for improved surveillance, the authors reviewed existing data on maternal health. METHODS: This review examines the scope and quality of existing information and the strengths and limitations of definitions of maternal mortality and morbidity used in data collection and reporting. RESULTS: This review suggests numerous gaps in surveillance of U.S. maternal health. Psychological as well as physical morbidity, and the presence and adequacy of appropriate treatment, should be ascertained. Quality of pregnancy-related care at the clinical and community levels, and the impact on mortality and morbidity, must be assessed. Collection of morbidity data outside of health care delivery sites is also essential. Trade-offs between nationally representative and other less comprehensive data sources, such as sentinel clinics, large healthcare organizations, and public healthcare financing systems, should be considered.

However, assumptions that unmarried women are uniformly at a disadvantage may be unfounded. A woman's relationship characteristics may be more relevant for infant health than her formal marital status. Methodology: Data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth were used to analyze associations between relationship characteristics and low birth weight among U.S. women aged 15-44 with a recent singleton live birth. Unadjusted odds ratios were generated to indicate the crude effects of independent variables, including relationship type and relationship duration at the time of conception. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to assess the impact of relationship variables on the likelihood of low birth weight, taking into account the effects of other covariates. Results: In multivariate models of all women and non-Hispanic black women, relationship type and duration were not associated with low birth weight. However, low birth weight was almost six times as likely among Hispanic women in nonmarital, noncohabiting relationships as among those who were married. Surprisingly, among non-Hispanic white women, low birth weight was less likely among those in nonmarital, noncohabiting relationships than among those who were married. Unexpected associations also were found among low birth weight, race and ethnicity, and relationship duration: Low birth weight was more likely among non-Hispanic white women in relationships of from five to 10 years in length than among those in relationships of longer than 10 years and less likely among Hispanic women in relationships of one year or less than among those in a relationship for more than 10 years. Conclusion: Although unmarried women in the United States have higher rates of low birth weight than married women, many unmarried women are at no greater risk of low birth weight than their married counterparts.

This paper investigates factors contributing to African Americans' lower likelihood of consenting to participation in medical research. In Study 1, three focus groups were conducted to assess concerns about research participation and to generate further hypotheses for questionnaire development. Study 2 presented a hypothetical clinical trial and collected questionnaire data on attitudes about participation. Both studies revealed a greater likelihood to mistrust the medical establishment among African American students. However, suspicion did not contribute to a decreased likelihood of participation.

This survey assessed editors' awareness of current debates, attitudes toward recent recommendations, and involvement in developing editorial policies. Twenty-nine editors of health journals with impact factors of ≥ 1 (based on citation ratings) were sent a questionnaire including four key problems identified in research literature and recommendations from federal agencies; 23 (79%) responded. Seven editors reported relevant policies. Two had read the federal directive on racial and ethnic classification; one was aware of its current review. Most perceived the four key problems as uncommon. The majority agreed with Public Health Service recommendations on race and ethnicity research, except for analyzing effects of racism. Approximately 20% had discussed issues with co-editors, editorial boards, or reviewers. About 40% saw further discussion as beneficial; four planned to draft guidelines. Editors' potential for helping resolve problems in race/ethnicity research is not being realized.

Results: Program participants were less likely to have inadequate prenatal care utilization than were historical controls (odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence interval=0.2, 0.7). There were no consistent effects with regard to maternal weight gain.

STUDY DESIGN: From 1991 and 1992 National Hospital Discharge Survey data, we estimated ratios of hospitalizations per 100 deliveries and compared relative ratios by maternal characteristics. We computed standard errors with the Sudaan program and estimated 95% confidence intervals for relative ratios. RESULTS: The likelihood of hospitalization for pregnancy complications appeared to decline between the period 1986 and 1987 and the period 1991 and 1992, although primarily for pregnancy loss hospitalizations. In 1991 and 1992 there were 18.0 total pregnancy-associated hospitalizations/100 births (17.2 for whites, 28.1 for blacks). Component ratios were 12.3 for obstetric hospitalizations, 4.4 for pregnancy loss hospitalizations, and 1.4 for nonobstetric hospitalizations; all ratios were higher for blacks than far whites. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal hospitalization remains a substantial component of prenatal care. Because of underreporting and changes in medical practice, recent declines in maternal hospitalization may not represent true reductions in maternal morbidity.","Maternal health services; Morbidity hospitalization; Pregnancy complications; Women's health","article; female; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; maternal care; maternal morbidity; pregnancy complication; prenatal care; priority journal; united states; Abortion, Spontaneous; Adolescent; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Length of Stay; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Risk Factors; United States",,,,,,,"Bennett, T.A.; Department of Maternal/Child Health, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7400, United States",,,,,,,,00029378,,AJOGA,9500498,"English","Am.

Little is known about the specific circumstances and consequences of adolescent pregnancy in rural areas. This article summarizes a systematic review of literature relevant to pregnancy and pregnancy prevention for rural adolescents for 1980 to 1995. The primary focus of this study was on the eight southeastern states in Department of Health and Human Services Region IV. From approximately 500 relevant citations in the database collected for this review, few dealt explicitly with adolescent pregnancy in rural areas, and an even smaller subset of the literature used empirical data. No data were found that indicated sexual activity was lower among rural teens, or that the risks of adolescent pregnancy and behaviors detrimental to pregnancy outcomes were less common in rural areas. Social isolation, lack of educational and economic opportunities, and limited access to health services are key issues with respect to rural youth and their healthy development. The relatively fewer numbers of health professionals in rural areas, weaker infrastructures for transportation and information, heightened concerns about confidentiality, low rates of insurance coverage, and reluctance to accept social services reduce the likelihood of rural teens receiving adequate preventive or reproductive care. Future research should address the social circumstances of rural adolescents to design effective interventions for teen pregnancy prevention and appropriate reproductive health services for young mothers and families in rural areas.",,"adolescent; adolescent pregnancy; female; health care access; health care utilization; health insurance; human; review; risk factor; rural health care; socioeconomics; traffic and transport",,,,,,"(1994) Sex and America's Teenagers, , New York, NY: Author; Alexander, C.S., Ensminger, M.E., Kim, Y.J., Smith, B.J., Johnson, K.E., Dolan, Early sexual activity among adolescents in small towns and rural areas: Race and gender patterns (1989) Family Planning Perspectives, 21 (6), pp. 261-266; Aneshensel, C.S., Becerra, K.M., Fielder, E.P., Schuler, R.H., Onset of fertility-related events during adolescence: A prospective cpmparison of Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white females (1990) American Journal of Public Health, 80 (8), pp. 959-963; (1994) Kids Count Databook: State Profiles of Child Well-being, , Baltimore, MD: Author; Blyth, D.A., (1993) Healthy Communities, Healthy Youth: How Communities Contribute to Positive Youth Development, , Minneapolis, MN: The Search Institute; Brody, G.H., Stoneman, Z., Flor, D., McCrary, C., Hatings, L., Conyers, O., Financial resources, parent psychological functioning, parent co-caregiving, and early adolescent competence in rural two-parent African-American families (1994) Child Development, 65 (2), pp. 590-605; Brown, S.S., Eisenberg, L., (1995) The Best Intentions: Unintended Pregnancy and the Well-being of Children and Families, , Washington, DC: Institute of Medicine, National Academy Press; (1994) The State of America's Children.

An emerging alternative is to broaden the notion to reproductive health. An inclusive perspective encompasses women's health issues in MCH. The purpose of this paper is to further the debate on the relationship of women's health to MCH. Specific aims are (1) to describe activities promoting women's health in MCH and (2) to examine consequences of alternative perspectives for MCH research, services, and training. METHOD: To achieve the first objective, I discuss developments in a state health agency and pertinent documents from the MCH Section of the American Public Health Association. To address the second aim, I follow the Bush Policy Analysis Model of weighing the three paradigms against the following evaluative criteria: equity, efficiency, satisfaction, stigma, indirect effects, feasibility, sensitivity to class and race, and social responsibility. RESULTS: The obstetric approach meets most criteria in a positive fashion; reproductive health satisfies criteria more positively and less equivocally. A women's health perspective bears the most potential for improving reproductive outcomes at this time, since no area of women's general health has been definitively shown to be irrelevant to reproduction (or vice versa). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that women's health should be incorporated more fully into the MCH field, as well as other areas of public health and medicine. Once research deficits have been addressed and the scope of reproductive health delineated more clearly, the alignment of women's health with MCH may be reevaluated.",,"article; attitude to health; child; epidemiology; female; forecasting; health care delivery; health care quality; health center; health education; human; infant; male; management; medical society; newborn; organization and management; pregnancy; preschool child; public health; United States; women's health; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Forecasting; Health Care Surveys; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal-Child Health Centers; National Health Programs; North Carolina; Policy Making; Pregnancy; Program Evaluation; Public Health; Societies, Medical; Women's Health",,,,,,,"Bennett, T.email: trude_bennett@unc.edu",,,,,,,,10927875,,,10728251,"English","Matern Child Health J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031290510

For 15-17-year-olds, white women had an abortion rate of 12 abortions per 1,000 in rural counties and 18 per 1,000 in metropolitan counties; black women had rates of 13 per 1,000 and 30 per 1,000 in rural and metropolitan areas, respectively. Similarly, the abortion ratio was lower in rural than in urban areas; for example, 18% of rural white women aged 18-19 who became pregnant had an abortion, compared with 35% of their metropolitan counterparts. Black 15-17-year-olds in metropolitan areas had a higher pregnancy rate (106 per 1,000) than those in rural counties (87 per 1,000). The pregnancy rate of white women aged 15-17 was similar in urban and metropolitan areas (about 46 per 1,000). Among rural women aged 18-19, 32% of births to whites and 45% of those to blacks resulted from a second or higher order pregnancy.",,"abortion; adolescent; adolescent pregnancy; adult; age; article; birth rate; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; pregnancy rate; race; rural area; school child; united states; Abortion, Induced; Adolescent; African Americans; Birth Rate; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Pregnancy Rate; Rural Population; Southeastern United States",,,,,,"Ventura, S.J., ""Advance Report of Final Natality Statistics, 1994,"" Monthly Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 44, No. 11, Supplement, 1996; and A.

Methods: Local and state-level informants knowledgeable about services to adolescents in the Southeastern United States were identified. Semistructured interviews were used to determine the program start date and time frame, funding sources, target population, participating counties, implementing agency or organization, specific program services, and status of program activities. These programs were categorized by the type of services offered and the population targeted. Results: The most common adolescent services in the rural Southeast attempt either to improve life options of youth, reduce sexual activity, or provide prenatal and postnatal care. Unlike urban areas where there are a variety of family planning providers, in the rural Southeast, health departments are the primary source of family planning for adolescents. There are no abortion providers in most rural areas of the Southeast. The majority of rural programs that include adolescents among the population served are developed for all women rather than specifically for adolescents. Programs specific to rural adolescents are described. Conclusions: The majority of programs in the rural Southeast address only selected adolescent health issues. Successful interventions require locally supported, multipronged, intensive approaches with consistent messages targeted to high-risk populations. Evaluation tools are needed to determine the effectiveness of each component of prevention programs.","Adolescents; Birth outcomes; Childbearing; Pregnancy in adolescence; Pregnancy prevention; Rural health services","adolescent; adolescent pregnancy; article; child health care; contraception; family planning; health care financing; health care need; health program; high risk population; human; postnatal care; prenatal care; priority journal; rural health care; sexual behavior; united states; Adolescent Pregnancy; Adolescents; Adolescents, Female; Age Factors; Americas; Delivery Of Health Care; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Family Planning; Family Planning Programs; Fertility; Health; Health Services; Literature Review; Maternal Health Services; Maternal-child Health Services; North America; Northern America; Organization And Administration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Prenatal Care; Primary Health Care; Program Effectiveness; Program Evaluation; Programs; Reproductive Behavior; Research Report; Rural Health Services; Rural Population--women; United States; Youth; Adolescent; Adolescent Health Services; Community Health Services; Family Planning Services; Female; Humans; Interviews; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Pregnancy Outcome; Rural Health Services; Southeastern United States",,,,,,"(1994) Sex and America's Teenagers, , New York: Alan Guttmacher Institute; (1991) Adolescent Health, , Washington, DC: United States Government Printing Office; Yawn, B.P., Yawn, R.A., Adolescent pregnancies in rural America: A review of the literature and strategies for primary prevention (1993) Fam Commun Health, 16, pp. 36-45; Walker, J.A., Harris, L., Blum, R., (1990) Outlooks and Insights: Understanding Rural Adolescents: Youth Policy for Rural Communities, , 4H Youth Development, Minnesota Extension Service, University of Minnesota; (1995) The Rural Adolescent Pregnancy Project, , North Carolina Rural Health Research Program, Cecil G.

METHODS: Women participants from the National Health Examination Survey (1960) and the Second National Health and Nutrition Survey (1976-1980) between the ages of 25 and 64 and currently employed or keeping house were included. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the cross- sectional association between employment status and high blood pressure in each survey, taking into account potential effect modifiers and covariates. RESULTS: In 1960 employment was associated with a slight, but not statistically significant, elevation in odds of high blood pressure. In 1976- 1980, it was associated with a modest but significant reduction in odds of high blood pressure. Variations in associations occurred by martial status (protective associations were limited to unmarried women) and race (associations were of stronger magnitude among African-American women). CONCLUSIONS: The employment status-high blood pressure relationship shifted across surveys. Changes in the composition of the employed and nonemployed groups account for at least part of the varying relationships.","blood pressure; cross- sectional study; Employment; race; socioeconomic status; Women","adult; article; demography; employment; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; priority journal; social aspect; statistical analysis; time; Adult; African Americans; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Educational Status; Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology); Employment; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Surveys; Housekeeping; Humans; Hypertension; Life Style; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors; Women, Working",,,,,,"Ries, P., Stone, A.J., American women today, a statistical portrait: Section 6, employment (1992) The American Women 1992-1993: A Status Report, pp. 306-349. , Ries P, Stone AJ, eds.

Maternal age is the only variable found to have a significant interaction with marital status among black mothers, and the risk associated with unmarried status increases with age. Among white mothers, age, educational level and receipt of prenatal care all show significant interactions with marital status; the increased risks of infant mortality attributed to unmarried motherhood are concentrated among subgroups usually thought to be at lower risk. For example, the risks of infant mortality among unmarried white women relative to married white women are highest among 25- 29-year-olds. However, being unmarried did not affect the risk of infant mortality among babies born to college-educated white women.Linked birth and death certificates were used in the analysis of data for 1983 to 1985 on singleton live births to Black and White women. The sample included 1,656,044 Blacks and 8,691,059 Whites. Marital status data was available directly for 41 states and inferred for the remainder from certificate information. Risk factors were age, parity, education, initiation of prenatal care, and urban residence. Differences by race converged when marital status was considered separately. Educational status of unmarrieds was similar for White and Black women. High infant mortality of over 20/1000 live births was found among unmarried Black women: women with over 3 children, women under 18 and over 34 years old, women with under 12 years of education, and women with later or no prenatal care. Increased risk of death was related to increasing age of the mother regardless of race. Risk of infant mortality was 24% higher for Black women over 35 years old than those less than 18-19 years old. The risk for unmarrieds began with adolescents, rose, and plateaued at 30 years old. Black unmarrieds had increased risk at 20-24 years, a peak at 25-29 years, and high levels for older women. White unmarrieds had the highest risk at ages 25-29, and risk associated with being single was greater for women with some college education. The caveat for the analysis was that the information was dated by 10 years; however other linked data in 1987 has been determined to be quite similar in trends. A strong finding was that unmarried status alone is not a good predictor and when combined with risk among disadvantaged women may not be a critical factor, since most unmarried women have high poverty rates. Race was considered a stronger marker of risk for infant mortality than marital status. Recommendations were for universal access to health care regardless of marital status and elimination of punitive measures restricting benefits to unmarried mothers. Programs need to build on the strengths of single mothers and promote social support systems.",,"adult; article; demography; disease association; education; female; health status; human; human experiment; infant mortality; marriage; maternal mortality; negro; normal human; prenatal care; risk factor; socioeconomics; Age Factors; Americas; Biology; Blacks--women; Correlation Studies; Cultural Background; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Ethnic Groups; Infant Mortality--determinants; Logistic Model; Marital Status; Mathematical Model; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; North America; Northern America; Nuptiality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistical Studies; Studies; United States; Whites--women; Adolescent; Adult; Blacks; Comparative Study; Female; Human; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Marital Status; Mothers; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors; United States; Whites",,,,,,,"Bennett, T.; Department of Maternal/Child Health, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States",,,,,,,,00147354,,FPGPA,7867772,"English","FAM.

We studied differences in the incidence of appendiceal perforation in patients with acute appendicitis according to their insurance coverage. Methods. In a retrospective analysis of hospital-discharge data, we examined the likelihood of ruptured appendix among adults 18 to 64 years old who were hospitalized for acute appendicitis in California from 1984 to 1989. Results. After controlling for age, sex, psychiatric diagnoses, substance abuse, diabetes, poverty, race or ethnic group, and hospital characteristics, we found that ruptured appendix was more likely among both Medicaid-covered and uninsured patients with appendicitis than among patients with private capitated coverage (odds ratios, 1.49 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.41 to 1.59] and 1.46 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.39 to 1.54], respectively). After adjustment for the above factors, the risk of appendiceal rupture associated with a lack of private insurance was elevated at both county and other hospitals, but admission to a county hospital was an independent risk factor. In all income groups, appendiceal rupture was more likely with fee-for-service than capitated private coverage (overall odds ratio, 1.20 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.25]). Conclusions. Among patients with appendicitis an increased risk of ruptured appendix may be due to insurance-related delays in obtaining medical care. Both organizational and financial features of Medicaid and various types or levels of private third-party coverage may be involved. The significant association between ruptured appendix and insurance coverage after adjustment for socio- economic differences suggests barriers to receiving medically necessary acute care that should be considered in current deliberations on health policy.",,"acute appendicitis; adult; age; appendix perforation; article; controlled study; ethnic group; female; health insurance; hospital; human; major clinical study; male; medicaid; poverty; priority journal; private health insurance; retrospective study; risk factor; united states; Adolescent; Adult; Appendicitis; California; Confidence Intervals; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Insurance, Hospitalization; Intestinal Perforation; Male; Medicaid; Medically Uninsured; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rupture, Spontaneous; Socioeconomic Factors; United States",,,,,,"Braveman, P.A., Egerter, S., Bennett, T., Showstack, J., Differences in hospital resource allocation among sick newborns according to insurance coverage (1991) JAMA, 266, pp. 3300-3308; Wenneker, M.B., Weissman, J.S., Epstein, A.M., The association of payer with utilization of cardiac procedures in Massachusetts (1990) JAMA, 264, pp. 1255-1260; Hadley, J., Steinberg, E.P., Feder, J., Comparison of uninsured and privately insured hospital patients: Condition on admission, resource use, and outcome (1991) JAMA, 265, pp. 374-379; Woolhandler, S., Himmelstein, D.U., Reverse targeting of preventive care due to lack of health insurance (1988) JAMA, 259, pp. 2872-2874; Hafner-Eaton, C., Physician utilization disparities between the uninsured and insured: Comparisons of the chronically ill, acutely ill, and well nonelderly populations (1993) JAMA, 269, pp. 787-792; Freeman, H.E., Blendon, R.J., Aiken, L.H., Sudman, S., Mullinix, C.F., Corey, C.R., Americans report on their access to health care (1987) Health Aff, 6 (1), pp. 6-8. , Millwood; Braveman, P., Bennett, T., Lewis, C., Egerter, S., Showstack, J., Access to prenatal care following major Medicaid eligibility expansions (1993) JAMA, 269, pp. 1285-1289; Haas, J.S., Udvarhelyi, I.S., Morris, C.N., Epstein, A.M., The effect of providing health coverage to poor uninsured pregnant women in Massachusetts (1993) JAMA, 269, pp. 87-91; Piper, J.M., Ray, W.A., Griffin, M.R., Effects of Medicaid eligibility expansion on prenatal care and pregnancy outcome in Tennessee (1990) JAMA, 264, pp. 2219-2223; Aday, L.A., Fleming, G.V., Andersen, R., (1984) Access to Medical Care in the U.S.: Who Has It, Who Doesn't, , Chicago: Pluribus Press; Billings, J., Teicholz, N., Uninsured patients in District of Columbia hospitals (1990) Health Aff, 9 (4), pp. 158-165. , Millwood; Weissman, J.S., Gatsonis, C., Epstein, A.M., Rates of avoidable hospitalization by insurance status in Massachusetts and Maryland (1992) JAMA, 268, pp. 2388-2394; Stafford, R.S., Cesarean section use and source of payment: An analysis of California hospital discharge abstracts (1990) Am J Public Health, 80, pp. 313-315; Brook, R.H., Ware Jr., J.E., Rogers, W.H., Does free care improve adults' health?

Design. —Retrospective analysis of birth certificates, assessing risks of inadequate prenatal care by insurance, controlling for maternal race/ethnicity, birthplace, age, parity, education, and marital status. Sample. —Singleton live births to California residents occurring in-state in 1990 (N=593 510). Outcome Measures. —Untimely initiation of care, too few visits, and no prenatal care. Results. —Despite major Medicaid expansions, nearly 11% of live births were uninsured for prenatal care. Being uninsured and having Medi-Cal were both risk factors of sizable magnitude, controlling for maternal characteristics. Compared with women who had private fee-for-service coverage, uninsured women were at elevated risk of untimely initiation (odds ratio [OR], 2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.47 to 2.60) and too few visits (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 2.44 to 2.55). Women with Medi-Cal had a high risk of untimely care (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 3.26 to 3.40); their risk of too few visits was also elevated (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.60 to 1.66) but less than for the uninsured. Lack of private insurance was a strong risk factor for no care (OR, 6.70; 95% CI, 6.00 to 7.47). Conclusions. —In spite of major Medicaid expansions, access to prenatal care was limited for women without private insurance. Medicaid was associated with untimely entry but with improved continuity. The findings suggest that financial barriers were salient even when controlling for many factors related to care-seeking behavior. Policy initiatives need to address continuing financial barriers along with other obstacles. © 1993, American Medical Association.

However, the relationship between marital status and birth outcomes varies by maternal race and age. The negative impact of unmarried status is greatest for white women aged 20 and over. High infant mortality rates for married teen mothers challenge the assumption that marriage necessarily provides a protective environment for childbearing. Maternal and child health research and policy have been hindered by a deviance model of out-of-wedlock fertility, which is both biased and outdated. Inconsistencies in the effect of marital status indicate variations in both economic and social resources. Purely behavioral explanations for escalated risks to unmarried mothers are not justified by research findings. Alternative interpretations suggest the need for greater societal involvement in maternal health care created in part by changes in family structure. © 1992.","infant mortality; low birthweight; marital status; maternal and child health; out-of-wedlock birth","birth outcome; birthweight; infant mortality; marital status; mortality rate; population fertility; socio-economic conditions; USA, North Carolina; adolescent; adolescent pregnancy; adult; article; behavior; child health; economic aspect; family; female; health; human; infant; infant mortality; marriage; maternal care; newborn; normal human; pregnancy; race; risk factor; social aspect; Adolescent; Adult; Birth Weight; Female; Human; Illegitimacy; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; North Carolina; Racial Stocks",,,,,,"National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), (1990) Advance Report of Final Natality Statistics, 1988, Monthly Vital Statistics Report, 39. , U.S. Public Health Service, Hyattsville, Maryland, No. 4, Suppl; National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), (1971) Infant Mortality Rates by Legitimacy Status: United States, 1964–1966, Monthly Vital Statistics Report, National Natality and Infant Mortality Surveys: 1964–1966, 20. , U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Rockville, Maryland, Suppl.

Design.—Retrospective analysis of computerized hospital discharge data, comparing resource allocation among newborns according to insurance status, controlling for race/ethnicity, diagnoses, hospital characteristics (ownership, teaching status, nursery level), and disposition. Setting.—All California civilian acute-care hospitals. Patients.—Population-based sample, excluding out-of-hospital and military hospital births. Resource allocation was studied among all newborns discharged in 1987 with evidence of serious problems (N =29 751). Main Outcome Measures.—Length of stay, total charges, and charges per day. Results.—Sick newborns without insurance received fewer inpatient services than comparable privately insured newborns with either indemnity or prepaid coverage. This pattern was observed across all hospital ownership types. Mean stay was 15.7 days for all privately insured newborns (15.6 days for those with indemnity and 15.7 days for those with prepaid coverage), 14.8 days for Medicaid-covered newborns, and 13.2 days for uninsured newborns (P<.001). Length of stay, total charges, and charges per day were 16%, 28%, and 10% less, respectively, for the uninsured than for all privately insured newborns (P<.001). Resources for newborns covered by Medicaid were generally greater than for the uninsured and less than for the privately insured.
