The method uses the Mie theory efficiency parameter for single-particle scattering and absorption, a single-particle extinction parameter. We have previously shown that, by properly screening the scattered light, we can determine the extinction of laser light when the beam transverses as many as ten scattering mean free paths in a dense medium, i.e. in the presence of significant multiple scattering. We present the application of the method to the total extinction due mainly to the excitations of the surface plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. Although the results obtained from measurements in this multiple-particle medium are explained in terms of the single-particle Mie extinction parameter, we find that the optimum particle size for maximum multiple-scattering extinction is smaller than that for the maximum single-particle extinction parameter predicted by the Mie theory.",,"Charged particles; Gold; Laser beam effects; Light scattering; Surface plasmon resonance; Radiative transport equation; Nanostructured materials",,,,,,"Van de Hulst, H.C., (1957) Light Scattering by Small Particles, , New York: Wiley; Chandrasekhar, S., (1960) Radiative Transfer, , New York: Dover; Lenoble, J., (1993) Atmospheric Radiative Transfer, , Hampton, VA: Deepak; Yodh, A., Chance, B., (1995) Phys.

A particle size distribution is constructed from polystyrene and glass spheres with the best available data for particle size distributions in the ocean. A volume scattering function is calculated from the Mie theory for the particles in water and in oil. The refractive-index ratios of particles in water and particles in oil are 1.19 and 1.01, respectively. The ratio 1.19 is comparable to minerals and nonliving diatoms in ocean water, and the ratio 1.01 is comparable to the lower limit for microbes in water. The point-spread functions are measured as a function of optical thickness for both water and oil mixtures and compared with the point-spread functions generated from the small-angle approximation. Our results show that, under conditions that emulate ocean water, the small-angle approximation is valid only for small optical thicknesses.

SPIE 1750, 397 (1992)] performed a simple Michelson interferometric determination of the coherence length of a multimode argon-ion laser after the light passed through a tank of water. As colloidal particles were added to the water the observed coherence length (as measured by twice the distance the mirror moved for fringes to disappear) decreased. Subsequently, a series of careful experiments were performed with a single-mode laser to more accurately measure this change. In these experiments it was found that the 1.5-MHz width of the 514.5-nm line of a single-mode argon-ion laser broadened by as much as 1.3±0.2 MHz when small colloidal particles were added. At first glance such a broadening should not have resulted in any discernible change in the original Michelson experiment because the gain curve for the multimode laser is of the order of a few gigahertz. The zeros in the fringe visibility function depend on the spectral characteristics of the modes. Upon scattering, the spectral characteristics of the individual laser modes change from Voigt functions, containing both Lorentzian and Gaussian components, to primarily Gaussian. It is this change in the statistical properties of the modes, not the broadening, that accounts for the change in the fringe visibility for a multimode source. © 1997 Optical Society of America.",,"Interferometers; Laser modes; Laser optics; Mathematical models; Mirrors; Optical beam splitters; Optical variables measurement; Photodiodes; Water; Fabry-Perot spectrometers; Michelson interferometric; Multimode argon ion laser; Photodiode array; Light scattering",,,,,,"Corney, A., (1977) Atomic and Laser Spectroscopy, p. 260. , Clarendon, Oxford; Swanson, N.L., Coherence loss of laser light propagated through simulated ocean waters (1992) Proc.

Thermal images were acquired with an IR scanning radiometer having a minimum detectable temperature difference of 0.1 degree centigrade and a spectral bandpass of 3-12 microns. Areas of a test runway, at Wright Laboratory, Tyndall AFB, FL, were prepared to assess the capability of detection for small cracks and subsurface voids. We wee able to detect voids that had been excavated beneath six inches of asphalt, millimeter width cracks, holes and other surface anomalies. During periods of diurnal heating and cooling,the surface anomalies radiate more energy than the bulk material and are easily detectable in the thermal images.

Individual camera versions are discussed, as well as global similarities useful in camera modeling. The cameras generally have behaviors that closely match eachother, but differ in sensitivity by factors of up to 12 for equal noise. The implication is that these intensified cameras - being short production-run items - display a great deal of individuality and that each camera must be carefully characterized before use. Reciprocity (product of radiance and exposure) and the variation of noise with radiance were also tested and found to be flat over three orders of magnitude, thus simplifying modeling.",,"Aerial photography; Arsenals; Charge coupled devices; Military engineering; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Spurious signal noise; Video cameras; Mine detectors; Target detection; Multispectral scanners",,,,,,,"Suiter, Harold R.; Naval Surface Warfare Cent., Panama, City, FL, USA",,"SPIE - Int Soc for Opt Engineering, Bellingham, WA USA","Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers, Bellingham, WA, United States","Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines and Minelike Targets II","21 April 1997 through 24 April 1997","Orlando, FL, USA",23061,0277786X,0819424943,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031378606

Light from a single-mode argon-ion laser was collected after scattering through water to which measured amounts of diatomaceous earth or 0.08-μm-diam polystyrene spheres were successively added. The broadening is attributed to coupling between fluctuations in particle concentration and spontaneous thermal fluctuations. Though spontaneous fluctuations exist in all pure fluids, they are very weak in water. However, the presence of the particles induces temperature gradients in the fluid, which in turn induce fluctuations in particle concentration.",,"Coherent light; Colloids; Density (optical); Fabry-Perot interferometers; Gas lasers; Spectrum analysis; Argon ion laser; Particle concentration; Spectral broadening; Light scattering",,,,,,"Crane, R., (1979) Opt.

It has been shown that, for Brownian motion of particles in a scattering medium, the coherence of incident light decreases rapidly with path length and diffusion coefficient. Experiments confirm that laser light scattered by a water column loses both spatial and temporal coherence as a function of path length and water turbidity. The results of an experiment which measures coherence length versus temperature, optical path length, and water quality are reported here. Based on these results and research into the causes of spectral broadening, experiments have been proposed which will measure the coherence loss resulting from each type of broadening mechanism. Also reported here are the results of the first such experiment which measures the loss of temporal coherence due to Doppler broadening.
