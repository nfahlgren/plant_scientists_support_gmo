Viral expression vectors offer a rapid and proven method to provide epigenetic expression of foreign sequences throughout infected plants. Expression of these sequences from viral vectors can lead to gain- or loss-of-function phenotypes, allowing gene function to be determined by phenotypic or biochemical effects in the infected plant. Tobacco mosaic virus and barley stripe mosaic virus expression vectors have been developed to express foreign gene sequences in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous hosts, respectively. Large-scale application of both viral vector systems for gene function discovery in Nicotiana and barley hosts resulted in high infection rates and produced distinctive visual phenotypes in ∼5% of transfected plants. Novel genes expressing potential herbicide target proteins in addition to genes promoting stem elongation, leaf development and apical dominance were identified in the large-scale screening. This report illustrates the adaptability of viral vectors for gene function discovery in higher plants.",,"herbicide; virus vector; barley stripe mosaic virus; gene function; leaf development; Mosaic virus; nonhuman; phenotype; plant disease; priority journal; review; RNA virus; Tobacco mosaic virus; transgenic plant; virus expression; DNA, Antisense; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Library; Genes, Plant; Genetic Vectors; Hordeum; Open Reading Frames; Phenotype; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA Viruses; Tobacco; Tobacco Mosaic Virus; Transcription, Genetic; Barley stripe mosaic virus; Embryophyta; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Nicotiana; Nicotiana tabacum; RNA viruses; Tobacco mosaic virus; vectors",,"DNA, Antisense",,,,"Ashikari, M., Wu, J., Yano, M., Rice gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant gene Dwarf 1 encodes the alpha-subunit of GTP-binding protein (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 10284-10289; Baulcombe, D.C., Fast forward genetics based on virus-induced gene silencing (1999) Curr Opin Plant Biol, 2, pp. 109-113; Baulcombe, D.C., Martin-Hernandez, A.M., (2002) Methods and means for gene silencing.

This powerful, reverse genetic approach, known as virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), has been demonstrated only in dicot plant species, where it has become an important tool for functional genomics. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is a tripartite, positive-sense RNA virus that infects many agriculturally important monocot species including barley, oats, wheat and maize. To demonstrate VIGS in a monocot host, we modified BSMV to express untranslatable foreign inserts downstream of the γb gene, in either sense or antisense orientations. Phytoene desaturase (PDS) is required for synthesizing carotenoids, compounds that protect chlorophyll from photo-bleaching. A partial PDS cDNA amplified from barley was 90, 88 and 74% identical to PDS cDNAs from rice, maize and Nicotiana benthamiana, respectively. Barley infected with BSMV expressing barley, rice or maize PDS fragments became photo-bleached and accumulated phytoene (the substrate for PDS) in a manner similar to plants treated with the chemical inhibitor of PDS, norflurazon. In contrast, barley infected with wild-type BSMV, or BSMV expressing either N. benthamiana PDS or antisense green fluorescent protein (GFP), did not photo-bleach or accumulate phytoene. Thus BSMV silencing of the endogenous PDS was homology-dependent. Deletion of the coat protein enhanced the ability of BSMV to silence PDS. This is the first demonstration of VIGS in a monocot, and suggests that BSMV can be used for functional genomics and studies of RNA-silencing mechanisms in monocot plant species.","Barley stripe mosaic virus; Functional genomics; Monocot; Phytoene desaturase; RNA silencing; VIGS","Chlorophyll; Enzymes; Genes; Genetic engineering; Molecular biology; RNA; Viruses; Genomics; Crops; Base Sequence; Carotenoids; Chlorophyll; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Silencing; Hordeum; Molecular Sequence Data; Mosaic Viruses; Oryza sativa; Oxidoreductases; Plants, Genetically Modified; Poaceae; Pyridazines; RNA Viruses; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Tobacco; Zea mays; Avena; Barley stripe mosaic virus; Dicotyledoneae; Embryophyta; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Liliopsida; Nicotiana; Nicotiana benthamiana; RNA viruses; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","GENBANK: AY062039","Carotenoids, 36-88-4; Chlorophyll, 1406-65-1; DNA, Complementary; norflurazone, 27314-13-2; Oxidoreductases, EC 1.-; phytoene dehydrogenase, EC 1.14.99.-; phytoene, 540-04-5; Pyridazines",,,,"Al-Kaff, N.S., Covey, S.N., Kreike, M.M., Page, A.M., Pinder, R., Dale, P.J., Transcriptional and posttranscriptional plant gene silencing in response to a pathogen (1998) Science, 279, pp. 2113-2115; Altpeter, F., Vasil, V., Srivastava, V., Vasil, I.K., Integration and expression of the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit 1A×1 gene into wheat (1996) Nature Biotechnol., 14, pp. 1155-1159; Angell, S.M., Baulcombe, D.C., Consistent gene silencing in transgenic plants expressing a replicating potato virus X RNA (1997) EMBO J., 16, pp. 3675-3684; Angell, S.M., Baulcombe, D.C., Potato virus X amplicon-mediated silencing of nuclear genes (1999) Plant J., 20, pp. 357-362; Bartley, G.E., Scolnik, P.A., Plant carotenoids: Pigments for photoprotection, visual attraction, and human health (1995) Plant Cell, 7, pp. 1027-1038; Bent, A.F., Arabidopsis in planta transformation.

The N gene confers resistance to TMV by mediating defence responses that function to limit viral replication and movement. We isolated the N gene and determined that N belongs to the nucleotide-binding-site-leucine-rich-repeat (NBS-LRR) class of plant disease resistance genes, and encodes both full-length and truncated proteins. Sequence homologies and mutagenesis studies indicated a signalling role for the N protein similar to that seen for proteins involved in defence responses in insects and mammals. The N gene confers resistance to TMV in transgenic tomato, demonstrating the use of the NBS-LRR class of disease resistance genes in engineering crop resistance. From the pathogen side of this interaction, the TMV 126 kDa replicase protein has been implicated as the avirulence factor that triggers N-mediated defence responses. We employed Agrobacterium-mediated expression strategies to demonstrate that expression of the putative helicase region of the replicase protein is sufficient to elicit N-mediated defences. The thermosensitivity of the N-mediated response to TMV is retained when induced by expression of this replicase fragment. Thus, both components of this gene-for-gene interaction are now available for studies that address the molecular mechanisms involved in N-mediated TMV resistance. © 1999 The Royal Society.","Crop genetic engineering; Gene-for-gene disease resistance; N gene; Plant disease resistance; Plant-pathogen interactions; Tobacco mosaic virus","N protein, Nicotiana glutinosa; vegetable protein; gene transfer; genetics; innate immunity; plant; review; tobacco; Tobacco mosaic virus; tomato; virology; Gene Transfer Techniques; Immunity, Natural; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Proteins; Plants, Toxic; Tobacco; Tobacco Mosaic Virus",,"N protein, Nicotiana glutinosa; Plant Proteins",,,,"Baker, B., Zambryski, P., Staskawicz, B., Dinesh-Kumar, S.P., Signaling in plant-microbe interactions (1997) Science, 276, pp. 726-733; Cao, H., Glazebrook, J., Clarke, J.D., Volko, S., Dong, X., The Arabidopsis NPR1 gene that controls systemic acquired resistance encodes a novel protein containing ankyrin repeats (1997) Cell, 88, pp. 57-63; Carrington, J.C., Jensen, P.E., Schaad, M.C., Genetic evidence for an essential role for potyvirus CI protein in cell-to-cell movement (1998) Plant J., 14, pp. 393-400; Century, K.S., Shapiro, A.D., Repetti, P.P., Dahlbeck, D., Holub, E., Staskawicz, B.J., NDR1, a pathogen-induced component required for Arabidopsis disease resistance (1997) Science, 278, pp. 1963-1965; Csillery, G., Tobias, I., Rusko, J., A new pepper strain of tomato mosaic virus (1983) Acta Phytopathol.

This defence response is characterized by cell death at the site of virus infection and inhibition of viral replication and movement. A previous study indicated that a portion of the TMV replicase containing a putative helicase domain is involved in HR induction. Here, this observation is confirmed and extended by showing that non-viral expression of a 50 kDa TMV helicase fragment (p50) is sufficient to induce the N-mediated HR in tobacco. Like the HR elicited by TMV infection, transgenic expression of p50 induces a temperature-sensitive defence response. We demonstrate that recombinant p50 protein has ATPase activity, as suggested by the presence of conserved sequence motifs found in ATPase/helicase enzymes. A point mutation that alters one of these motifs abolishes ATPase activity in vitro but does not affect HR induction. These results suggest that features of the TMV helicase domain, independent of its enzymatic activity, are recognized by N-containing tobacco to induce TMV resistance.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; amino acid sequence; enzyme mechanism; enzyme structure; helicase; host resistance; pathogenicity; replicase; tobacco mosaic virus; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Genes, Plant; Genes, Viral; Plants, Genetically Modified; Plants, Toxic; Rhizobium; RNA Helicases; RNA Replicase; Temperature; Tobacco; Tobacco Mosaic Virus; Nicotiana obtusifolia; Nicotiana tabacum; Tobacco mosaic virus",,"Adenosine Triphosphatases, EC 3.6.1.-; RNA Helicases, EC 2.7.7.-; RNA Replicase, EC 2.7.7.48; tobacco mosaic virus replicase, EC 2.7.7.-",,,,"Baker, B., Zambryski, P., Staskawicz, B., Dinesh-Kumar, S.P., Signaling in plant-microbe interactions (1997) Science, 276, pp. 726-733; Bevan, M., Binary agrobacterium vectors for plant transformation (1984) Nucl.
