In agriculture and forestry, genetic diversity can enhance production in all agricultural and ecosystem zones. Genetic erosion is the loss of genetic diversity, which is being caused not just at the level of individual genes but at the level of gene combination, which is even more dangerous. The main cause of genetic erosion is varietal replacement. However, there are many traditional varieties that are extremely high yielding and that can, in fact, form a much bigger mix of varieties available in the field than this very narrow approach to increasing productivity would suggest. Genetic erosion is happening at a more rapid pace in developing countries because of the somewhat faulty planning to bring about change and increase productivity. Above all, agrobiodiversity, which is genetic diversity related to agriculture, is threatened not because of overuse but because it is not used .","agriculture; agrobiodiversity; conservation; food; forestry; gender; Genetic diversity; genetic erosion; indigenous knowledge; productivity; social structure; varietal replacement","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; developing world; food production; food security; forestry; gene flow; genetic resource; species diversity; South Asia",,,,,,"(1999) What Is Happening to Agrobiodiversity?, , http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5609e/y5609e02.htm; (2004) Soil Biota and Biodiversity: The ""root"" of Sustainable Agriculture, , http://www.fao.org/ag/agl/agll/soilbiod/docs/SB-brochure-sept.pdf","Sahai, S.; Gene Campaign, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, India",,,,,,,,09715231,,,,"English","South Asian Surv.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650281615

Currently available GM crops are those that were developed for industrialized agriculture in developed countries, complete with their positive and negative traits. At least one of them, the Herbicide Tolerance (HT) trait, is not just irrelevant to our country's needs, it is downright harmful to the agricultural and food systems that strengthen local food security. Using HT crops will reduce the demand for labor in a labor surplus country where agricultural operations such as weeding provide wages, especially for women; it will reduce food and nutrition availability for the poor by eliminating natural leafy greens, it will strike at human and veterinary health by destroying locally available medicinal plants, and it will increase risks of crop failure by making it impossible to engage in mixed cropping, which distributes risk and provides more food and nutrition. © 2008 Springer Netherlands.","agriculture; developing country; GE crops; herbicide tolerance; loss of medicinal plants; loss of nutrition; loss of women's wages",,,,,,,"Baorong, L., Zhiping, S., Jiakuan, C., Can transgenic rice cause ecological risks through transgene escape?

It is deeply concerned about the negative impacts of privatisation on genetic resources through patenting and intellectual property rights. Biological resources are the mainstay of the livelihoods and local economies of communities in developing countries. Ensuring access to these resources is essential to their being able to engage in self-reliant growth. Women who are closely involved with the maintenance of biological resources are also its most sophisticated users, in feeding and looking after their families. The privatisation of these resources would undermine the ability of women to care for their families and seriously jeopardise the health and security of rural and tribal populations.",,"gender issue; gender role; genetic resource; intellectual property rights; resource management; Asia; Eurasia",,,,,,"Balakrishna, P., Moving towards trade negotiations of WTO and its implications on environment and biodiversity (2000) The Training Seminar on 'WTO, UNCTAD and Regionalism: Implications for the Private and Public Sectors in South Asia, , Law and Society Trust, Colombo; (1992), www.biodiv.org/convention/article.asp, Conventional on Biological DiversityTen reasons not to join UPOV (1998) Global Trade and Biodiversity in Conflict, 2. , Gaia Foundation - GRAIN; (1998) Convention of Farmers and Breeders (CoFaB), , Gene Campaign and CEAD a draft treaty presented as an alternative to UPOV, New Delhi; (2001) Gender Relations and Biodiversity, , www.gtz.de/biodiv, GTZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH) Issue Papers BIODIV; (2002) Local Knowledge of Conserving Biodiversity from a Gender Perspective, , www.flora.org.pe, GTZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH) Project Papers BIODIV; Krishna, S., Gender and bio diversity management (1998) Gender Dimensions in Biodiversity Management, , M.S.
