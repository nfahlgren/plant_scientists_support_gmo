In the following joint statement, the claimed consensus is shown to be an artificial construct that has been falsely perpetuated through diverse fora. Irrespective of contradictory evidence in the refereed literature, as documented below, the claim that there is now a consensus on the safety of GMOs continues to be widely and often uncritically aired. For decades, the safety of GMOs has been a hotly controversial topic that has been much debated around the world. Published results are contradictory, in part due to the range of different research methods employed, an inadequacy of available procedures, and differences in the analysis and interpretation of data. Such a lack of consensus on safety is also evidenced by the agreement of policymakers from over 160 countries - in the UN’s Cartagena Biosafety Protocol and the Guidelines of the Codex Alimentarius - to authorize careful case-by-case assessment of each GMO by national authorities to determine whether the particular construct satisfies the national criteria for ‘safe’. Rigorous assessment of GMO safety has been hampered by the lack of funding independent of proprietary interests. Research for the public good has been further constrained by property rights issues, and by denial of access to research material for researchers unwilling to sign contractual agreements with the developers, which confer unacceptable control over publication to the proprietary interests. The joint statement developed and signed by over 300 independent researchers, and reproduced and published below, does not assert that GMOs are unsafe or safe. Rather, the statement concludes that the scarcity and contradictory nature of the scientific evidence published to date prevents conclusive claims of safety, or of lack of safety, of GMOs. Claims of consensus on the safety of GMOs are not supported by an objective analysis of the refereed literature. © 2015, Hilbeck et al.; licensee Springer.",,"assessment method; biosafety; data set; flora; genetically modified organism; literature review; policy making; property rights; research work",,,,,,"Séralini, G.E., Clair, E., Mesnage, R., Gress, S., Defarge, N., Malatesta, M., Hennequin, D., Spiroux de Vendômois, J., Republished study: long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize (2014) Environ Sci Eur, 26 (1), p. 1; Carman, J.A., Vlieger, H.R., Ver Steeg, L.J., Sneller, V.E., Robinson, G.W., Clinch-Jones, C.A., Haynes, J.I., Edwards, J.W., A long-term toxicology study on pigs fed a combined genetically modified (GM) soy and GM maize diet (2013) J Org Syst, 8 (1), pp. 38-54; Frewin, G., (2013) The new “is GM food safe?” meme.

Semi-structured interviews with professionals engaged in the research and management of livestock disease control provide the data for a reading proposing that the real basis of policy relating to socio-technical hazards is deeply political and cannot be purified through 'escape routes' to objectivity. Scientists and risk managers are shown calling, on the one hand, for risk-based policy approaches while on the other acknowledging a range of policy drivers outside the scope of conventional quantitative risk analysis including group interests, eventualities such as outbreaks, historical antecedents, emergent scientific advances and other contingencies. Calls for risk-based policy are presented, following cultural theory, as ideals connected to a reductionist epistemology and serving particular professional interests over others rather than as realistic proposals for a paradigm shift. © 2015 European Society for Rural Sociology.",,"agricultural policy; disease control; livestock farming; risk assessment; theoretical study",,,,,,"Austin, Z., Alcock, R.E., Christley, R.M., Policy, practice and decision making for zoonotic disease management: water and cryptosporidium (2012) Environment International, 40, pp. 70-78; Austin, Z., Christley, R., Fish, R., Lost in translation: assessing knowledge sources, exchange and effectiveness in animal disease control (2012) Rural economy and land use programme policy and practice notes.

They evidence many scientists' desire to help humanity confront the momentous biophysical implications of its own actions. But they also reveal a limited conception of social science and virtually ignore the humanities. They thereby endorse a stunted conception of 'human dimensions' at a time when the challenges posed by global environmental change are increasing in magnitude, scale and scope. Here, we make the case for a richer conception predicated on broader intellectual engagement and identify some preconditions for its practical fulfilment. Interdisciplinary dialogue, we suggest, should engender plural representations of Earth's present and future that are reflective of divergent human values and aspirations. In turn, this might insure publics and decision-makers against overly narrow conceptions of what is possible and desirable as they consider the profound questions raised by global environmental change.© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I argue that the main focus on publics has been developed with insufficient primary attention to problematising what is meant by 'science' in its variable public forms, including discourses. We cannot understand 'publics' in relation to 'science', unless we also ask, searchingly, what is it that they experience as such, in all its multiple self-contradictions and confusions? Thus I reiterate the point made in the inaugural issue, still neglected in mainstream science and policy, that 'science' needs to be critically addressed in several dimensions, as part of public understanding of science research. First, instrumental pragmatic scientific meanings, useful in their own parochial situations, should not be given automatic sovereignty in public issues. Second, public concerns where they exist should not be interpreted and judged against this presumptively entrenched scientistic normative baseline. © The Author(s) 2014.","idolatry; meanings of science; political economy of science; public meanings; reinvented public deficit models; scientism",,,,,,,"Arendt, H., (2005) The Promise of Politics, , New York: Schocken Books; Atkinson, R., Rights and responsibilities in scientific research (1978) Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 34 (10), pp. 10-14; Barnes, B., Bloor, D., (1982) Rationality and Relativism, pp. 1-47. , Hollis MLukes S, ed.;, Oxford: Blackwell; Barnes, B., Shapin, S., (1979) Natural Order, , London: SAGE; Beddington, J., Declare gross intolerance of bad science (2011) Research Fortnight, , http://www.researchresearch.com/index.php?option=com_news&template=rr_2col&view=article&articleId=1032320, 16February.

Metadata capture what happens on the backstage of science, on the trajectory from study conception, design, funding, implementation, and analysis to reporting. Definitions of metadata vary, but they can include the context information surrounding the practice of science, or data generated as one uses a technology, including transactional information about the user. As the pursuit of knowledge broadens in the 21st century from traditional ""science of whats"" (data) to include ""science of hows"" (metadata), we analyze the ways in which metadata serve as a catalyst for responsible and open innovation, and by extension, science diplomacy. In 2015, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will formally come to an end. Therefore, we propose that metadata, as an ingredient of responsible innovation, can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the post-2015 agenda. Such responsible innovation, as a collective learning process, has become a key component, for example, of the European Union's 80 billion Euro Horizon 2020 R&amp;D Program from 2014-2020. Looking ahead, OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology, is launching an initiative for a multi-omics metadata checklist that is flexible yet comprehensive, and will enable more complete utilization of single and multi-omics data sets through data harmonization and greater visibility and accessibility. The generation of metadata that shed light on how omics research is carried out, by whom and under what circumstances, will create an ""intervention space"" for integration of science with its socio-technical context. This will go a long way to addressing responsible innovation for a fairer and more transparent society. If we believe in science, then such reflexive qualities and commitments attained by availability of omics metadata are preconditions for a robust and socially attuned science, which can then remain broadly respected, independent, and responsibly innovative.

While a plurality of knowledge-making processes were deployed to render transgenes visible or invisible, we analyze how a particular in vitro based DNA-centered knowledge came to marginalize other forms of knowledge, thus obscuring other bio-cultural dimensions key to the understanding of gene flow and maize diversity. We show that dominant molecular norms of proof and standards of detection, which co-developed with the world of industrial monocropping and gene patenting, discarded and externalized non-compliant actors (i.e. complex maize genomes, human dimensions of gene flow). Operating in the name of high science, they hence obscured the complex biological and cultural processes that maintain crop diversity and enacted a cultural–political domination over the world of Mexican landraces and indigenous communities. © The Author(s) 2014.","co-production; epistemic cultures; genetically modified organisms; laboratory–field relations; legibility–illegibility; maize biocultures; Mexico’s indigenous landraces; normalization","cultural anthropology; gene flow; genetics; maize; Mexico; politics; transgene; transgenic plant; Culture; Gene Flow; Mexico; Plants, Genetically Modified; Politics; Transgenes; Zea mays",,,,,"ANR, Agence Nationale de la Recherche","Alvarez-Morales, A., Transgenes in maize landraces in Oaxaca: Official report on the extent and implications The 7th international symposium on the biosafety of genetically modified organisms, , .; 2002ISBGMO, Beijing, China; 2002. 78; Aquino, P., Carrión, F., Calvo, R., Flores, D., (2001) CIMMYT 1999–2000 World Maize Facts and Trends.

This raises important questions about the contemporary anatomies of publics, and what count as legitimate expressions of public concern over scientific stakes within the knowledge economy. Implicit in the tension between inclusion and surveillance are concerns over the social meaning and authority of science amongst both scientific practitioners and publics. Bringing science and technology studies (STS) and social movement studies (SMS) into dialogue offers a means to explore the neglected ontological stakes in the framing of scientific imaginaries of publics, and public imaginaries of science. Post-WWII UK science-publics relations have emerged in three significant modalities, with publics imagined: as passive non-entities, circa 1950-1990 (continuing); as incipient threats due to presumed deficits in their grasp of science 1990-2000 (continuing); and, since circa 2000, as politicised threats requiring state control. Each modality is shaped by elite denial of the normative commitments embedded within science as surrogate politics-scientism. In each mode, scientistic elite emphasis on epistemic issues forecloses engagement with broader public meanings expressing legitimate normative and ontological differences. Fusing the more epistemic focus of STS with SMS's emphasis on meaning and democratic process offers a route to deeper democratic forms of public engagement with what is called science, which would also precipitate more accountability in elite discourses around science and technology. © 2013 Copyright Process Press.","collective meanings; deficit models; scientific imaginaries of publics; scientism; Social imaginary; social movements",,,,,,"Cardiff University; ESRC, Economic and Social Research Council","Aho, E., Cornu, J., Georghiou, L., Subira, A., (2006) Creating an Innovative Europe: Report of the Independent Expert Group on R&D and Innovation, , Chaired by E.

Nevertheless, the consensus is that although models are uncertain, some may yet inform effective action. This assumes that the quality of a model can be ascertained in order to evaluate sufficiently model uncertainties, and to decide whether or not, or in what ways or under what conditions, the model should be 'used'. We examined uncertainty in modelling, utilising a range of data: interviews with scientists, policy-makers and advisors, and analysis of policy documents, scientific publications and reports of major inquiries into key livestock epidemics. We show that the discourse of uncertainty in infectious disease models is multi-layered, flexible, contingent, embedded in context and plays a critical role in negotiating model credibility. We argue that usability and stability of a model is an outcome of the negotiation that occurs within the networks and discourses surrounding it. This negotiation employs a range of discursive devices that renders uncertainty in infectious disease modelling a plastic quality that is amenable to 'interpretive flexibility'. The utility of models in the face of uncertainty is a function of this flexibility, the negotiation this allows, and the contexts in which model outputs are framed and interpreted in the decision making process. We contend that rather than being based predominantly on beliefs about quality, the usefulness and authority of a model may at times be primarily based on its functional status within the broad social and political environment in which it acts. © 2013 Christley et al.",,"article; decision support system; discourse analysis; disease model; disease predisposition; disease simulation; foot and mouth disease; functional status; high risk population; human; infection; interview; nonhuman; political system; predictive value; process model; risk assessment; social environment; spatiotemporal analysis; species difference; statistical distribution; uncertainty; Animals; Communicable Diseases; Foot-and-Mouth Disease; Great Britain; Humans; Models, Biological; Uncertainty",,,,,"Defra, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; BBSRC, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; ESRC, Economic and Social Research Council; NERC, Natural Environment Research Council","(2011) Defra's Contingency Plan for Exotic Notifiable Diseases of Animals, , Defra, London: Defra; (2007) Pandemic Flu - A national framework for responding to an influenza pandemic, , Department of Health, London; Morens, D.M., Folkers, G.K., Fauci, A.S., The challenge of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 242-294; Woolhouse, M., Population biology of emerging and re-emerging pathogens (2002) Trends Microbiol, 10, pp. S3-S7; Guitian, J., Pfeiffer, D., Should we use models to inform policy development?

The analysis identifies several substantive factors that influence the credibility of scientific communication. Starting from the now-accepted point that public uptake of science depends primarily upon the trust and credibility public groups are prepared to invest in scientific institutions and representatives, the paper observes that these are contingent upon the social relationships and identities that people feel to be affected by scientific knowledge, which never comes free of social interests or implications. The case study shows laypeople capable of extensive informal reflection upon their social relationships toward scientific experts, and on the epistemological status of their own ""local"" knowledge in relation to ""outside"" knowledge. Public uptake of science might be improved if scientific institutions showed an equivalent reflexive practice in the public domain, where their legitimate authority rightly rests on their trustworthiness. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cesium; Chernobyl; Cumbria; Food contamination; Food safety; Lay knowledge; Participation; Public understanding of science; Radiation protection; Radioactive fallout; Risk communication; Scientific knowledge; Sellafield reprocessing plant; Sheep farming; Windscale reprocessing plant",,,,,,,"Arnold, L., (1992) Windscale 1957: The anatomy of a nuclear accident, , Macmillan, London, New York; Beresford, N.A., Lamp, C.S., Mayes, R.W., Howard, B.J., Colgrove, P.M., The effect of treating pastures with bentonite on the transfer of 137Cs from grazed herbage to sheep (1989) Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, 9, pp. 112-122. , (This paper recognizes the loss of body weight suffered by the sheep in these tests, though it suggests this may be due to the direct effects of the bentonite, and ignores the possible effect of their being fenced in); Burke, P., We the people: popular culture and popular identity in Modern Europe (1991) Modernity and identity, pp. 293-310. , Blackwell, Oxford, Cambridge, Mass, (This capability could be equated with the informal resistance of people in solidary sub cultures to meanings, identities or rationalities imposed on them from 'outside', as in Bailey, F.

Accounts of biomedicalization, biotechnology, biopower, biocapital, and bioeconomy tend to agree that twentieth- and twenty-first-century life sciences transform the object of biology, the biological. Amidst so much transformation, we explore attempts to stabilize the biological through standards. We ask: how do standards handle the biological in transformation? Based on ethnographic research, the article discusses three contemporary postgenomic standards that classify, construct, or identify biological forms: the Barcoding of Life Initiative, the BioBricks Assembly Standard, and the Proteomics Standards Initiative. We rely on recent critical analyses of standardization to suggest that any attempt to attribute a fixed property to the biological actually multiplies dependencies between values, materials, and human and nonhuman agents. We highlight ways in which these biological standards cross-validate life forms with forms of life such as publics, infrastructures, and forms of disciplinary compromise. Attempts to standardize the biological, we suggest, offer a good way to see how a life form is always also a form of life. © The Author(s) 2013.","biology; infrastructures; proteomics; publics; standards; synthetic biology; taxonomy",,,,,,,"Agapakis, C.M., Silver, P.A., Synthetic Biology: Exploring and Exploiting Genetic Modularity through the Design of Novel Biological Networks (2009) Molecular BioSystems, 5 (7), pp. 704-713; Anderson, J.C., Dueber, J.E., Leguia, M., Wu Gabriel, C., Goler, J., Arkin, A.P., Keasling, J.D., BglBricks: A Flexible Standard for Biological Part Assembly (2010) Journal of Biological Engineering, 4 (1), p. 1; Andrianantoandro, E., Basu, S., Karig, D.K., Ron, W., Synthetic Biology: New Engineering Rules for an Emerging Discipline (2006) Molecular Systems Biology, 2 (2006), p. 0028; Democratizing Proteomics Data (2007) Nature Biotechnology, 25 (3), p. 262; Thou Shalt Share your Data (2008) Nature Methods, 5 (3), p. 209; Asara, J.M., Schweitzer, M.H., Freimark, L.M., Phillips, M., Cantley, L.C., Protein Sequences from Mastodon and Tyrannosaurus Rex Revealed by Mass Spectrometry (2007) Science, 316, pp. 280-285; Barsnes, H., Vizcaino, J.A., Eidhammer, I., Martens, L., PRIDE Converter: Making Proteomics Data-sharing Easy (2009) Nature Biotechnology, 27 (7), pp. 598-599; (2010) The BioBricks Foundation, , http://biobricks.org, BBF,Accessed March8, 2010; Billings, L., Endy, D., Synthetic Biology (2008) SEED Magazine, , http://seedmagazine.com/images/uploads/16cribsheet.pdf, Cribsheet No. 16, Accessed 14 January 2013; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (1999) Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bradshaw, R.A., Alma, L., Burlingame, S.C., Aebersold, R., Reporting protein identification data: the next generation of guidelines (2006) Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, 5, pp. 787-788; Brent, R., A Partnership between Biology and Engineering (2004) Nature Biotechnology, 22 (10), pp. 1211-1214; Callon, M., (1986) Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge?, pp. 196-233. , Law John, ed.;, London, UK: Routledge; Cambrosio, A., Keating, P., Schlich, T., Weisz, G., Biomedical Conventions and Regulatory Objectivity: A Few Introductory Remarks (2009) Social Studies of Science, 39 (5), pp. 651-664; Clarke, A.E., Shim, J.K., Mamo, L., Fosket, J.R., Fishman, J.R., Biomedicalization: Technoscientific Transformations of Health, Illness, and U.S. Biomedicine (2003) American Sociological Review, 68 (2), pp. 161-194; Cooper, M., (2008) Life as Surplus: Biotechnology and Capitalism in the Neoliberal Era, , Seattle: University of Washington Press; Costa, F.O., Carvalho, G.R., The Barcode of Life Initiative: Synopsis and Prospective Societal Impacts of DNA Barcoding of Fish (2007) Genomics, Society and Policy, 3 (2), pp. 29-40; Daston, L., Type Specimens and Scientific Memory (2004) Critical Enquiry, 31 (1), pp. 153-182; Ellis, R., Waterton, C., Wynne, B., Taxonomy, Biodiversity and their Publics in 21st Century Barcoding (2009) Public Understanding of Science, 19 (4), pp. 497-512; Endy, D., Foundations for Engineering Biology (2005) Nature, 438 (7067), pp. 449-453; Fortun, M., (2008) Promising Genomics: Iceland and DeCODE Genetics in a World of Speculation, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Grünberg, R., Müller, K.M., Arndt, K.M., (2010) RFC25: Fusion Protein (Freiburg) BioBrick Assembly Standard, , http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/45140, iGEM 2007 Team Freiburg,April 21; Hartwell, L.H., Hopfield, J.J., Leibler, S., Murray, A.W., From Molecular to Modular Cell Biology (1999) Nature, 402 (6761 SUPPL.), pp. C47-C52; Hebert, P.D.N., Cywinska, A., Ball, S.L., deWaard, J.R., Biological Identifications through DNA Barcodes (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 270 (1513), pp. 313-321; Heinemann, M., Panke, S., Synthetic Biology: Putting Engineering into Biology (2006) Bioinformatics, 22 (22), pp. 2790-2799; Helmreich, S., (2009) Alien Ocean: Anthropological Voyages in Microbial Seas, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Helmreich, S., What Was Life?

The fear that species are becoming extinct before they have ever been known fuels barcoders, and the speed, scope, economy and 'user-friendliness( claimed for DNA barcoding, as part of the larger ferment around the 'genomics revolution(, has also encouraged promises that it could inspire humanity to reverse its biodiversity-destructive habits.This book is based on six years of ethnographic research on changing practices in the identification and classification of natural species. Informed both by Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the anthropology of science, the authors analyse DNA barcoding in the context of a sense of crisis - concerning global biodiversity loss, but also the felt inadequacy of taxonomic science to address such loss. The authors chart the specific changes that this innovation is propelling in the collecting, organizing, analyzing, and archiving of biological specimens and biodiversity data. As they do so they highlight the many questions, ambiguities and contradictions that accompany the quest to create a genomics-based environmental technoscience dedicated to biodiversity protection. They ask what it might mean to recognise ambiguity, contradiction, and excess more publicly as a constitutive part of this and other genomic technosciences.Barcoding Nature will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology of science, science and technology studies, politics of the environment, genomics and post-genomics, philosophy and history of biology, and the anthropology of science. © 2013 Claire Waterton, Rebecca Ellis and Brian Wynne.",,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Indigenous knowledge and the politics of classification (2002) International Social Science Journal, 54 (173), pp. 277-281; Allander, T., Emerson, S.U., Engle, R.E., Purcell, R.H., Bukh, J., A virus discovery method incorporating dnase treatment and its application to the identification of two bovine parvovirus species (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 98, pp. 11609-11614; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Arnot, D.E., Roper, C., Bayoumi, R.A., Digital codes from hypervariable tandemly repeated DNA sequences in the plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite gene can genetically barcode isolates (1993) Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology, 61, pp. 15-24; Atkinson, P., Glasner, P., Lock, M., Genetics and society: Perspectives from the twenty-first century (2009) Handbook of Genetics and Society: Mapping the New Genomic Era, pp. 1-14. , in Atkinson, P., Glasner, P. and Lock, M., London: Routledge; Atran, S., Pre-theoretical aspects of aristotelian definition and classification of animals (1985) Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, 16, pp. 111-162; Avise, J., (1994) Molecular Markers, Natural History, and Evolution, , New York, Chapman & Hall; Avise, J., (2004) Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution, , 2nd Edition, Sunderland, MA, Sinauer Associates; Ballard, J., Whitlock, M., The incomplete history of mitochondria (2004) Molecular Ecology, 13 (4), pp. 729-744; Barad, K., Posthumanist performativity: Toward an understanding of how matter comes to matter (2003) Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 28 (3), pp. 801-831; Barad, K.M., (2007) Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Barbieri, M., Biosemiotics: A new understanding of life (2008) Naturwissenschaften, 95, pp. 577-599; Barnes, B., Afterword (2010) Nature after the Genome, , in Parry, S. and Dupre, J, Oxford, Blackwell; Barnes, B., Shapin, S., (1979) Natural Order: Historical Studies of Scientific Culture, , London, California, New York, Sage Publications; Barnes, B., Bloor, D., Henry, J., (1996) Scientific Knowledge: A Sociological Analysis, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Barry, A., (2001) Political Machines: Governing a Technological Society, , London and New York, Athlone Press; Basset, Y., Novotny, V., Miller, S., Weiblen, G., Missa, O., Stewart, A., Conservation and biological monitoring of tropical forests: The role of parataxonomists (2004) Journal of Applied Ecology, 41, pp. 164-174; Bataille, G., (1991) Accursed Share, 1. , R.

By focusing on an episode of major importance in Britain's nuclear history – the Windscale Inquiry, a public hearing about the future of fuel reprocessing – he offers a powerful critique of such judicial procedures and the underlying assumptions of the rationalist approach.This second edition makes available again this classic and still very relevant work. Debates about nuclear power have come to the fore once again. Yet we still do not have adequate ways to make decisions or frame policy deliberation on these big issues, involving true public debate, rather than ritualistic processes in which the rules and scope of the debate are presumed and imposed by those in authority. The perspectives in this book are as significant and original as they were when it was written.The new edition contains a substantial introduction by the author reflecting on changes (and lack of) in the intervening years and introducing new themes, relevant to today’s world of big science and technology, that can be drawn out of the original text. A new foreword by Gordon MacKerron, an expert on energy and nuclear policy, sets this seminal work in the context of contemporary nuclear and related big technology debates. © Brian Wynne, 1982, 2011.

Werner, A., ZALF, Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research, Institute of Land Use Systems, Eberswalder Str. 84, 15374 Müncheberg, Germany","The assessment of the impacts of growing genetically modified (GM) crops remains a major political and scientific challenge in Europe. Concerns have been raised by the evidence of adverse and unexpected environmental effects and differing opinions on the outcomes of environmental risk assessments (ERA). The current regulatory system is hampered by insufficiently developed methods for GM crop safety testing and introduction studies. Improvement to the regulatory system needs to address the lack of well designed GM crop monitoring frameworks, professional and financial conflicts of interest within the ERA research and testing community, weaknesses in consideration of stakeholder interests and specific regional conditions, and the lack of comprehensive assessments that address the environmental and socio-economic risk assessment interface. To address these challenges, we propose a European Network for systematic GMO impact assessment (ENSyGMO) with the aim directly to enhance ERA and post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) of GM crops, to harmonize and ultimately secure the long-term socio-political impact of the ERA process and the PMEM in the EU. These goals would be achieved with a multi-dimensional and multi-sector approach to GM crop impact assessment, targeting the variability and complexity of the EU agro-environment and the relationship with relevant socio-economic factors. Specifically, we propose to develop and apply methodologies for both indicator and field site selection for GM crop ERA and PMEM, embedded in an EU-wide typology of agro-environments. These methodologies should be applied in a pan-European field testing network using GM crops. The design of the field experiments and the sampling methodology at these field sites should follow specific hypotheses on GM crop effects and use state-of-the art sampling, statistics and modelling approaches.

Using the 2009 German ban of genetically modified maize MON810 and debates concerning the quality of science cited to support it, the paper highlights how values are tacitly embedded in science for policy and how ethical questions permeate the way this science is developed, quality-controlled, and given authority in the European regulation of biotechnology. We argue that a lack of recognition and inadequate treatment of such value-commitments influencing science, and through this policy, impinges upon and weakens the ethical standards involved. This has particular significance as Europe debates genetically modified crop legislative reform. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"agricultural policy; biotechnology; crop production; genetically modified organism; governance approach; maize; policy reform; Europe; Zea mays",,,,,,"Albo, A.G., Mila, S., Digilio, G., Motto, M., Aime, S., Corpillo, D., Proteomic analysis of a genetically modified maize flour carrying Cry1Ab gene and comparison to the corresponding wild-type (2007) Maydica, 53, pp. 443-455; Andow, D.A., Hilbeck, A., Science-based risk assessment for nontarget effects of transgenic crops (2004) BioScience, 54, pp. 637-649; Barnes, B., Edge, D., (1982) Science in context: Readings in the sociology of science (Milton Keynes: Open University Press), , (Eds); Barros, E., Lezar, S., Anttonen, M.J., van Dijk, J.P., Röhlig, R.M., Kok, E.J., Engel, K.H., Comparison of two GM maize varieties with a near-isogenic non-GM variety using transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics (2010) Plant Biotechnology Journal, 8, pp. 436-451; Batista, R., Oliveira, M., Plant natural variability may affect safety assessment data (2010) Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, 58, pp. 8-12; Bossdorf, O., Richards, C., Pigliucci, M., Epigenetics for ecologists (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 106-115; Bøhn, T., Primicerio, R., Hessen, D.O., Traavik, T., Reduced fitness of Daphnia magna fed a Bt-transgenic maize variety (2008) Archives of Environmental Contamination Toxicology, 55, pp. 584-592; Diels, J., Cunha, M., Manaia, C., Sabugosa-Madeira, B., Silva, M., Association of financial or professional conflict of interest to research outcomes on health risks or nutritional assessment studies of genetically modified products (2011) Food Policy, 36, pp. 197-203; Doubleday, R., Wynne, B., Despotism and democracy in UK science: Experiments in reframing citizenship (2011) Reframing rights: Bioconstitutionalism in the genetic age, pp. 239-261. , In: Jasanoff S., editors Cambridge, Cambridge,: MIT Press; (2010) Proposal amending directive 2001/18/EC as regards the possibility for the members states to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in their territory COM(2010) 375, , http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/docs/proposal_en.pdf, EC.

At the same time, it is not clear what ethical expertise consists in and what its political status in modern democracies can be. Starting from the ""participatory turn"" in recent social research and policy, we will argue that bioethical reasoning has to include public views of and attitudes towards biomedicine. We will sketch the outlines of a bioethical conception of ""public understanding of ethics,"" addressing three different issues: (a) the methodological relevance of moral questions and problems raised by lay persons in everyday life regarding biomedicine and technology, (b) the normative relevance of such lay moralities for the justification of ethical decisions, and (c) the necessity of public deliberation in this context. Finally, we draw conclusions in view of the concepts and methods such a conception of ""public understanding of ethics"" should employ. © 2011 The Author(s).","Deliberation; Ethics expertise; Lay moralities; Participation; Public understanding of science; Qualitative social research","article; bioethics; ethics; human; medical ethics; morality; philosophy; policy; public opinion; Bioethical Issues; Ethical Analysis; Ethics, Medical; Humans; Morals; Philosophy, Medical; Public Opinion; Public Policy",,,,,,"Bauer, M.W., Allum, N., Miller, S., What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research?

However, the criteria and timing for policy response and the resulting management decisions are often altered when a disease outbreak occurs and captures full media attention. In the case of waterborne disease, such as the robust protozoa, Cryptosporidium spp, exposure can cause significant human health risks and preventing exposure by maintaining high standards of biological and chemical water quality remains a priority for water companies in the UK. Little has been documented on how knowledge and information is translated between the many stakeholders involved in the management of Cryptosporidium, which is surprising given the different drivers that have shaped management decisions. Such information, coupled with the uncertainties that surround these data is essential for improving future management strategies that minimise disease outbreaks. Here, we examine the interplay between scientific information, the media, and emergent government and company policies to examine these issues using qualitative and quantitative data relating to Cryptosporidium management decisions by a water company in the North West of England. Our results show that political and media influences are powerful drivers of management decisions if fuelled by high profile outbreaks. Furthermore, the strength of the scientific evidence is often constrained by uncertainties in the data, and in the way knowledge is translated between policy levels during established risk management procedures. In particular, under or over-estimating risk during risk assessment procedures together with uncertainty regarding risk factors within the wider environment, was found to restrict the knowledge-base for decision-making in Cryptosporidium management. Our findings highlight some key current and future challenges facing the management of such diseases that are widely applicable to other risk management situations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Catchment management; Disease risk; Drinking water; Knowledge transfer; Public health; Waterborne outbreaks","Catchment management; Disease risk; Knowledge transfer; Public health; Waterborne outbreaks; Catchments; Diseases; Industry; Knowledge management; Potable water; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Water quality; Health risks; catchment; decision making; disease control; drinking water; health risk; public health; risk assessment; risk factor; stakeholder; water quality; waterborne disease; article; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; decision making; epidemic; government regulation; health care management; mass medium; politics; priority journal; risk assessment; risk management; United Kingdom; water contamination; water supply; Cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; Decision Making; Disease Outbreaks; Drinking Water; England; Environment; Environmental Policy; Humans; Policy; Politics; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Water Supply; England; United Kingdom; Cryptosporidium; Protozoa",,"Drinking Water",,,,"(2006), Anglesey County Council; Anglesey Local Health Board; Centre for Research into Environment and Health; Dwr Cymru; Environment Agency Wales; Gwynedd County Council; Gwynedd Local Health Board; National Public Health Service for Wales.

These have been developed from STS researchers' involvement in practical engagement processes and research with scientists, science funders, policy and other public stakeholders. The strategic aim of this specific method, to develop what is termed second-order reflexivity amongst scientist-technologists, builds upon and advances earlier more general STS work. However this method is focused and structured so as to help generate such reflexivity-over the 'upstream' questions which have been identified in other STS research as important public issues for scientific research, development and innovation-amongst practising scientists-technologists in their specialist contexts (public or private, in principle). This is a different focus from virtually all such previous work, and offers novel opportunities for those key broader issues to be opened up. The further development of these promising results depends on some important conditions such as identifying and engaging research funders and other stakeholders like affected publics in similar exercises. Implementing these conditions could connect the productive impacts of midstream modulation with wider public engagement work, including with 'uninvited' public engagement with science. It would also generate broader institutional and political changes in the larger networks of institutional actors which constitute contemporary technoscientific innovation and governance processes.

In this paper, an interdisciplinary framework for representing strategies of containment, and analysing how uncertainties are embedded and propagated through them, is developed and illustrated. Analysis centres on persistent, periodic and emerging disease threats, with a particular focus on cryptosporidiosis, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza. Uncertainty is shown to be produced at strategic, tactical and operational levels of containment, and across the different arenas of disease prevention, anticipation and alleviation. The paper argues for more critically reflexive assessments of uncertainty in containment policy and practice. An interdisciplinary approach has an important contribution to make, but is absent from current real-world containment policy. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Animal disease; Containment; Interdisciplinarity; Policy; Uncertainty","agricultural policy; avian influenza; disease control; disease incidence; foot and mouth disease; governance approach; interdisciplinary approach; policy approach; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; animal; animal disease; article; avian influenza; biological model; bird; communicable disease; cryptosporidiosis; decision making; interdisciplinary communication; legal aspect; policy; uncertainty; United Kingdom; Animals; Birds; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Cryptosporidiosis; Decision Making; Great Britain; Influenza in Birds; Interdisciplinary Communication; Models, Biological; Public Policy; Uncertainty; Animalia; Aves",,,,,,"Wynne, B., Uncertainty and environmental learning: Reconceiving science and policy in the preventive paradigm (1992) Global Environ.

Our approach to the issue of publics differs from that of conventional public understanding of or engagement with science work. Combining science and technology studies with critical political theory allows us to examine the discursive and material formation of publics occurring within the science of DNA barcoding. Co-productionist theory suggests BOLI to be actively crafting its prospective publics imaginatively, as an integral part of its self-composition as public science. Drawing on the work of Laclau's On Populist Reason, we examine how such normatively weighted abstract publics are necessarily chronically incomplete, with an unavoidable tension between the universal and the particular. © 2010 The Author(s).",,"article; biodiversity; classification; DNA sequence; policy; species difference; Biodiversity; Classification; Public Policy; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity",,,,,,"Ackrich, M., User Representations: Practices, Methods and Sociology (1995) Managing Technology in Society: The Approach of Constructive Technology Assessment, pp. 167-184. , in Arie Rip, Thomas Misa and Johan Schot (eds), London: Pinter; Avise, J.C., (1994) Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution, , New York: Chapman and Hall; Barber, B., Foundationalism and Democracy (1996) Democracy and Difference: Contesting the Boundaries of the Political, pp. 348-360. , in S.

This article places such propositional concerns in the perspective of a different understanding of the relationships between scientific knowledge and public policy issues from the conventional 'translation' model, in which prior scientific research and understanding is communicated and translated into corresponding policies - or not, if it remains disputed and overly uncertain. Explaining some of the key contingencies and bases for uncertainty in IPCC climate projections and human influences, I show how social and technical analysis of climate science is not about denial of the scientific propositional claims at issue, but about understanding the conditional and essentially ambiguous epistemic character of any such knowledge, however technically sophisticated and robust it may be. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is entirely plausible that existing scientific representations of climate change and its human causes may understate the risks induced by prevailing social-economic processes rather than exaggerate them. As the article shows, the public meanings given to climate science, and to 'the climate problem', and thus also the public culture which that knowledge is supposed to inform, are themselves already in key respects presumed and (attemptedly) imposed by the science and its framing. This gives rise to perverse effects on public readiness to take informed democratic responsibility for 'the global climate problem', and associated cross-cutting issues which existing scientific framings of public policy erase from view. © 2010 SAGE.","Climate-models; Co-production; Imagined publics; Long-term climate prediction; Risk and public meaning; Uncertainty",,,,,,,"Arendt, H., (2005) The Promise of Politics, , New York: Schocken Books; Brooks, H., Technology Assessment in Retrospect (1976) Newsletter on Science, Technology, & Human Values, 17, pp. 17-29. , (Oct.); Brooks, H., Cooper, C., (1987) Science for Public Policy, , Dordrecht: Elsevier; (1994) The Right Tools for the Job: At Work in Twentieth-Century Life Sciences, , Clarke, A. and J.

In an article titled ""Is Science a Public Good?"" Callon contributed to the debate about the commercialization of science by suggesting that commercialization and the public good need not be incompatible. Moving away from arguments that center on the effects (positive or negative) of business involvement in science, he suggested that analysts use another model, centered on ""diversity."" This model allows us to ask what society might want from science, what public good science might look like, and how public good science can be ensured while also recognizing that science cannot be easily separated from the market. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Commercialization; Diversity; Plant genomics; Public good",,,,,,,"(2004) Research Agendas Work Stream: Information Summary and Analysis Paper, , Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission.

Whilst the development of new technology is cast as providing contributions to both quality of life and national competitiveness, what has been termed a 'legitimacy crisis' is seen as threatening the vitality of this process. However in contrast to the risk debates that dominated the technological controversies of the late 1990s the vitality of technological innovation is now cast as vulnerable to lack of public confidence and trust in the regulatory and governance structures upon which such innovation depends. In order to address this deficit in public trust, science policy has increasingly turned to the social sciences, suggesting that public values might be incorporated into the development of nanotechnology at an early stage. Public ambivalence therefore constitutes the problem addressed by the increasingly central role that public engagement and participation play in contemporary science policy. Although the recent proliferation of public engagement activities is premised on the need to address this ambivalence through direct engagement, we re-interpret ambivalence as an engaged - rather than passive - mode of relating to technological determinism. Whilst the move toward forms of direct public engagement might be regarded as symptomatic of the emergence of affective mode of governance we interpret public ambivalence as a nested set of enthusiasms and anxieties.

This commentary raises some questions about this approach. First, I note that manifest influence in science or policy or both should not become - by default, or deliberately - a criterion of intellectual quality for STS research work. I distinguish between (1) reflective historical work, which delineates the contingent ways in which existing policy and technoscientific cultures have become entrenched as such inscribed and perhaps dysfunctional institutional habit; and (2), work of the kind that Webster's three case studies exemplify, that is, geared to influence policy-decision outcomes. I suggest that many of the important issues facing STS - and ""policy"" - are not explicit ""policy-decision issues"" as such, but implicit ""policy syndromes"" that need naming, diagnosing and open, if enforced, institutional reflection. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Imagined users; Institutional reflexivity; Instrumental influence as epistemic criterion; Policy cultural syndrome; Policy engagement as fieldwork and theory development",,,,,,,"Aho, E., (2006) Creating an Innovative Europe, , Report of the Independent Expert Group on R&D and Innovation appointed following the Hampton Court Summit and chaired by Mr. Esko Aho.

Noting how previously discredited and supposedly abandoned public deficit explanations of 'mistrust' have actually been continually reinvented, it argues that this is a symptom of a continuing failure of scientific and policy institutions to place their own science-policy institutional culture into the frame of dialogue, as possible contributory cause of the public mistrust problem.

By examining today's plant and human genomics sciences, I question this from both ends: first suggesting that typical public culture was already aware of particular salient forms of complexity, such as limits to predictive knowledge (which are often denied by scientific cultures themselves); second, showing how up-to-date genomics science expresses both complexity and its opposites, predictive determinism and reductionism, as coexistent representations of nature and scientific knowledge. I suggest we can understand this self-authored epistemic confusion in modern science by avoiding 'the usual suspects' - fading simpler discourses left over from previous scientific times; media oversimplifications; or the need to 'simplify' to essentials, for ignorant publics - and looking instead at the silent imaginations of extra-scientific reference groups reflected and projectively performed in scientific discourses-practices themselves. Thus contradictions of complex scientific understandings are systematically created by science's own embodiment of epistemic commitments influenced by commercial cultures, and by imagined publics who are important new constructed objects of institutional scientific concerns - over authority and trust. New dimensions of complexity thus come alive through paying attention to neglected tacit dimensions of science-society interrelations.","Complexity; Epistemic culture; Genomics; Imagined publics; Prediction-control; Reduction; Reflexivity; Systems biology",,,,,,,"Ast, G., How did alternative gene-splicing evolve?

Climate change policy faces at least three major challenges: (1) what is known – or not known – about climate change, in particular regarding the relative importance of anthropogenic factors; (2) what can and should be done; and (3) who should do something about it? Since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, these challenges have been addressed in several ways: (a) by increasing research and international sharing and integration of expertise on climate change (e.g., the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change); (b) by developing international agreements on issues such as the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions; and (c) by promoting national/local strategies to fulfil international agreements (e.g., Local Agenda 21 – community defined strategies for sustainable development arising from the first “Earth Summit” held in Rio in 1992). These challenges all include policy and scientific aspects but also raise questions over the interpretation of Local Agenda 21 (Tuxworth 1996; Selman and Parker 1997; Voisey et al. 1996; Young 1996; Young 1997). How local is “local”? What kind of “agenda” is “Agenda 21”? Whose “agenda” is it? Answers to these questions vary according to the perspectives and purposes of those asking the questions in the first place. © Cambridge University Press 2003.All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9780511490972; 0521818184; 9780521818186,,,"English","Public Participation in Sustainability Science.

Based on empirical material gathered through in-depth groups in Venice (Italy) and citizens' panels in St. Helens (UK), the paper explores: (1) some of the challenges and opportunities of qualitative and comparative research on climate change; and (2) the similarities and differences in citizens' environmental assessment in two European cities facing economic, urban and social re-structuring. The authors research reveals a general willingness to participate, albeit conditional, despite initial scepticism and interrogation about the objectives. During the process, participants in both cities show: (a) a broad contextual understanding of uncertainties and complexities; (b) how important interpersonal skills between lay and expert publics are; and (c) that precaution should generally apply in the case of uncertainties concerning global environmental change.

The survey is based largely on the responses of 19 climate modellers to several questions and a discussion document circulated in 1995. We interpret the responses in terms of the following factors: the implicit assumptions which scientists hold about how the environmental policy process deals with scientific uncertainty over human-related global warming; the different scientific styles that exist in climate research; and the influence of organisations, institutions, and policy upon research agendas. We find evidence that scientists' perceptions of the policy process do play a role in shaping their scientific practices. In particular, many of our respondents expressed a preference for keeping discussion of the issue of flux adjustments within the climate modeling community, apparently fearing that climate contrarians would exploit the issue in the public domain. While this may be true, we point to the risk that such an approach may backfire. We also identify assumptions and cultural commitments lying at a deeper level which play at least as important a role as perceptions of the policy process in shaping scientific practices. This leads us to identify two groups of scientists, 'pragmatists' and 'purists', who have different implicit standards for model adequacy, and correspondingly are or are not willing to use flux adjustments.",,"climate change; climate modeling; general circulation model; policy analysis",,,,,,"Jasanoff, S., (1990) The Fifth Branch: Science Advisers as Policymakers, , Harvard University Press, Harvard; Ezrahi, Y., (1990) The Descent of Icarus, , Harvard University Press, Harvard; (1994) Science and Judgement in Risk Assessment, , National Academy Press, Washington D.C; Stern, P., Fineberg, H., (1996) Understanding Risk: Informing Decisions in a Democratic Society, , National Academy Press, Washington D.C; Brown, G.E., Environmental Science under Siege in the U.S. Congress (1997) Environment, 39 (2), pp. 13-20; Edwards, P.N., Schneider, S., The IPCC 1995 Report: Broad Consensus or ""Scientific Cleansing""?

The discussion draws substantially on the findings of a research project which has investigated public perceptions of the risks from major accident hazards in seven communities in the UK. Implications for the Directive's requirements on emergency information provision, public access to safety reports and consultation on emergency plans are considered. Our conclusions stress the need for risk communication to be seen as a long term and ongoing process, involving active listening to public reasoning about risk and a sensitivity to the context in which communication is taking place. In meeting both needs and rights to information and encouraging and enabling public participation, we conclude that the Directive should contribute in some degree to an improved environment for dialogue and the building of trust.

Following other studies about public perceptions of expert/scientific knowledge, it is unclear why the public should - or even want to - approach issues (such as climate change) from the epistemologically privileged expert-framed perspectives of IA. The objective of this paper is to reverse the order and re-centre the problematique of public participation and IA toward a public-centred perspective, toward a `folk integrated assessment'. In order to undertake this task, illustrations of how groups of lay members of the public perceive and think about issues such as climate change are presented and analyzed.

We describe how the apical position of General Circulation Models (GCMs) appears to follow 'logically' both from conventional understandings of scientific representation and the use of knowledge, so acquired, in decision-making. We argue, however, that both of these particular understandings are contestable. In addition to questioning their current policy-usefulness, we draw upon existing analyses of GCMs which discuss model trade-offs, errors, and the effects of parameterisations, to raise questions about the validity of the conception of complexity in conventional accounts. An alternative approach to modelling, incorporating concepts of uncertainty, is discussed, and an illustrative example given for the case of the global carbon cycle. In then addressing the question of how C-CMs have come to occupy their dominant position, we argue that the development of global climate change science and global environmental 'management' frameworks occurs concurrently and in a mutually supportive fashion, so uniting GCMs and environmental policy developments in certain industrialised nations and international organisations. The more basic questions about what kinds of commitments to theories of knowledge underpin different models of 'complexity' as a normative principle of 'good science' are concealed in this mutual reinforcement. Additionally, a rather technocratic policy orientation to climate change may be supported by such science, even though it involves political choices which deserve to be more widely debated.",,"atmospheric modelling; climate change; environmental planning; GCMs; general circulation model; modelling approach; uncertainty",,,,,,"Lavins, R., The Strategy of Model Building in Population Biology (1966) Amer.

The uncertainty in each of the deterministic exercises is due to the following: variation between different models; variation in one model due to different assumptions about feedbacks; and limited parametric uncertaintyThe uncertainty (66% confidence limits) of the pre-industrial level of CO2, (pa)Pi is thus reduced from 275 ±15 ppmv to 275 ±7,5 ppmv which is closer to the uncertainty discussed by Schimel et al.

We show how the maintained consensus about the quantitative estimate of a central scientific concept in the anthropogenic climate-change field - namely, climate sensitivity -operates as an 'anchoring device' in 'science for policy'. In international assessments of the climate issue, the consensus-estimate of 1.5°C to 4.5°C for climate sensitivity has remained unchanged for two decades. Nevertheless, during these years climate scientific knowledge and analysis have changed dramatically. We identify several ways in which the scientists achieved flexibility in maintaining the same numbers for climate sensitivity while accommodating changing scientific ideas. We propose that the remarkable quantitative stability of the climate sensitivity range has helped to hold together a variety of different social worlds relating to climate change, by continually translating and adapting the meaning of the 'stable' range. But this emergent stability also reflects an implicit social contract among the various scientists and policy specialists involved, which allows 'the same' concept to accommodate tacitly different local meanings. Thus the very multidimensionality of such scientific concepts is part of their technical imprecision (which is more than just analytical lack of resolution); it is also the source of their resilience and value in bridging (and perhaps reorganizing) the differentiated social worlds typical of modern policy issues. The varying importance of particular dimensions of knowledge for different social groups may allow cohesion to be sustained amidst pluralism, and universality to coexist with cultural distinctiveness.",,,,,,,,"Parson, E.A., Integrated assessment and environmental policy making, in pursuit of usefulness (1995) Energy Policy, 23 (4-5), pp. 463-475. , April/May; (1979) Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment, , Washington, DC: Climate Research Board, NAS; (1983) Changing Climate, Report of the Carbon Dioxide Assessment Committee, , Washington, DC: Board on Atmospheric Sciences & Climate, Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Resources, National Research Council; Bolin, B., Döös, B.R., Jäger, J., Warrick, R.A., (1986) The Greenhouse Effect, Climatic Change and Ecosystems, , Chichester, Hants.: John Wiley & Sons, SCOPE Report No. 29, SCOPE is the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment of the International Council of Scientific Unions [ICSU]; The World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security; Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J.J., (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Houghton, J.T., Callander, B.A., Varney, S.K., (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Houghton, Meira Filho, L.G., Bruce, J.P., Lee, H., Callander, Haites, E., Harris, N., Maskell, K., (1995) Climate Change 1994: Radiative Forcing of Climate Change and an Evaluation of the IPCC IS'92 Emission Scenarios, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Houghton, J.T., Meira Filho, L.G., Callander, B.A., Harris, N., Kattenberg, A., Maskell, K., (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Victor, D.G., Clark, W.C., (1991) The Greenhouse Effect in the US: A History of Science Up to 1985, , contribution I-2 to the Project on Social Learning in the Management of Global Environmental Risks, Science, Technology & Public Policy Program, John F.

In this paper we argue to the contrary that in the case of Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) ambiguity in their precise meaning is a major reason why they have been developed and continue as scientific policy tools [although this is not how they are commonly represented in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]. We survey and analyse the range of opinion on GWPs with respect to their scientific stability and comprehensiveness and argue that the utility of GWPs has to be evaluated in terms of their symbolic, interactional and heuristic effects as well as with respect to their direct instrumental uses. In addition, we argue that scientific discussion of GWPs commonly incorporates elements of the social and policy contexts of their application and provide several examples from detailed discussions at the IPCC. We endeavour to account for the ambiguous identity of GWPs and draw out several implications from the findings of the paper for the construction and use of scientific tools in policy.",,"climate change; environmental policy; global warming; Global Warming Potentials; policy; policy making; scientific ambiguity",,,,,,,"Shackley, S.; Ctr Study Evmtl Change, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YN, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031430919

However, it does so with a wider interest in mind, namely the putative building of a European political culture. In order to do so it attempts to identify some underlying cultural dimensions of scientific discourses for policy - of standardization, comparability and objectivity. We analyse one case in detail, that of nature classification under the European CORINE1 environmental information system. We argue that some basic assumptions made in the construction of this environmental information system have implications not only for science and policy in the sphere of the environment, but for broader debates about identifications with European political culture. © 1996 Routledge.","CORINE; EEA; Environmental policy; Europe; Standardization",,,,,,,"Ammer, U., (1976) Ecological Mapping of the Community: Report and Recommendations for A Method, , (English translation), München: Arbeittsgruppe Landschaftstechnik an der Universitat; Bayliss, D., Walker, G., Environmental monitoring in the European Union (1994) European Environment, 4 (1), pp. 14-18; Beck, U., (1986) Risk Society: Towards A New Modernity, , London: Sage; Boehmer-Christiansen, S., Skea, J., (1991) Acid Politics, , London: Belhaven; Bowker, G., Starr, S.L., Situations vs. standards in long-term, wide-scale decision-making: The case of the international classification of diseases (1991) System Science 24th International Conference Proceedings HICSS-24, 4, pp. 73-81. , January; Buller, H., Lowe, P., Flynn, A., National responses to the Europeanisation of environmental policy: A selective view of comparative research (1993) European Integration and Environmental Policy, , J.D.

Revisiting several case studies helps to illustrate the point that complexity, now or in the past, resides especially in the social relationships within and between institutions and agents. Much current thinking about complexity is moving towards development of ever more sophisticated methodologies with which to probe complex systems, hence to facilitate their management and control. We argue that such methodological elaboration frequently acts as a direct substitute for institutional development and reflexivity, and we urge instead for exploration of new forms of institutional mediation.

Uncertainty tends to challenge the authority of climate science, especially if it is used for policy making, but the relationship between authority and uncertainty is not simply an inverse one. In policy contexts, many scientists are compelled to talk about uncertainty but do not wish to imply that uncertainty is a serious challenge to the authority of scientific knowledge or to its substantial use in policy making. ""Boundary-ordering devices,"" the contextual discursive attempts to reconcile uncertainty and authority in science, depend critically for their success on their ""dual"" interpretation: at a general level across a boundary and differently on either side of it. The authors empirically identify a range of such boundary-ordering devices in the climate field.",,,,,,,,"Apling, A., Rationale to greenhouse concerns (1993) Conference on ""The Chemistry of Global Warming,"", , London, 17 February; Balling, R.C., (1992) The Heated Debate: Greenhouse Predictions Versus Climate Reality, , San Francisco: Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy; Balmer, B., (1993) Mutations in the Research System?, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of Sussex; Bengtsson, L., Climate system modeling prospects (1992) Climate System Modeling, pp. 705-724. , edited by K.

This preliminary analysis has significant potential implications for scientific practices, and for future research and environmental policies, not least because mutual construction may now risk inadvertently foreclosing consideration of potentially significant alternative scientific research and policy approaches in the climate-change and related environmental fields. -Authors",,"climate change; climatic change; environmental policy; mutual construction; policy; policy making; research; science role",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029539889

Using the idea of a 'certainty trough' from sociology of science, and employing crop models as an example, it explores the sometimes terse relationship between climate modellers and the climate impacts community. The pressures to develop a more holisitic analysis are discussed, but we argue that much integrated assessment modelling still exhibits an implicit and acultural reductionism, and frequently misconstrues the character and significance of uncertainty as well as the role of analytical knowledge in policy making. © 1995.",,"climate change; climate impact; climate model; climatic change; conceptual approach; holistic analysis; integrated assessment; knowledge integration; knowledge net; knowledge pyramid; man- environment relations; methodological evaluation; climate; climate change; community; environment; human; management; model; sociology",,,,,,"Schneider, CO2, climate and society: a brief overview (1983) Social Science Research and Climate Change: An Interdisciplinary Appraisal, pp. 9-15. , This is how some authors have previously used the pyramid metaphor, R Chen, E Boulding, S Schneider, D Reidel, Dordrecht; Kellogg, Schware, (1981) Climate Change and Society, , Also, Westview Press, Boulder, CO; Carter, Parry, Nishioka, Harasawa, (1992) Preliminary Guidelines for Assessing Impacts of Climate Change, , The schemata of the knowledge pyramid and knowledge net share some similarities with the different approaches to impact assessment discussed by; Kates, The Interaction of Climate and Society (1985) Climate Impact Assessment: Studies of the Interaction of Climate and Society, pp. 3-36. , and by, Robert Kates, Jesse Ausubel, Mimi Berberian, Wiley, Chichester; Latour, (1987) Science in Action, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, [1992]; Stewart, Cohen, Why are there simple rules in a complicated universe?

In this sense, the knowledge pyramid may perhaps be better characterized as a ‘knowledge hour glass’ since a large body of climatological and physical knowledge from many different (sub)disciplines gets crystallised in the GCM framework, as a precondition for generating GCM output for impacts work.

Examples to support both camps can be found. There are major questions concerning the propagation of model errors and the sheer absence of key variables in particular sub-models of lAMs (for example, irrigation is not included separately in the appropriate submodel of IMAGE). But to imagine that there is some threshold beyond which the uncertainties arising from integrating models becomes unacceptable is to: (a) underplay the large uncertainties in many individual models prior to integration; and (b) to assume that the interactions between included and non-included model components are not significant whereas this is [[Truncated]]Zukin, DiMaggio, (1990) Structures of Capital: The Social Organisation of the Economy, pp. 14-23. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Economics has a notoriously impoverished account of human values and agency; Douglas, (1992) Risk and Blame, , HMSO, London; Technological change should be seen as a sociocultural process as well as a techno-economic one and is, according to some analysts, a key variable in understanding socioeconomic change even though it is treated as an exogenous variable in most economic modelsBijker, Hughes, Pinch, (1990) The Social Construction of Technological Systems, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Coombs, Saviotti, Walsh, (1987) Economics and Technological Change, , HMSO, London; Douglas, Hull, (1992) How Classification Works, , Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh; Stehr, von Storch, The Social Construction of Climate and Climate Change (1994) Max-Planck-Institut für Meteorologie, Report No 137, , Hamburg; Parry, (1978) Climatic Change, Agriculture and Settlement, p. 119. , Dawson and Archon Books, Folkestone, especially chapters 5 and 6.

However good the GCMs, the simulation of future regional climate change will be limited by the indeterminacy of socioeconomic and technical developments which will govern where sulphate emissions occur; Many of the studies which have considered climate change in the wider context of the extended knowledge pyramid have found that climate change becomes only one of a number of significant future changes (others including population growth and liberalization of agricultural trade), for exampleThis, and other impressions, are based on interviews and discussions with impacts scientists and GCM modellers in the USA in March and April 1994, and in the UK throughout 1993 and 1994.

However, attempts to establish EC policy on global warming have coincided with intensifying conflict over moves to greater monetary and political union. The roles of The Netherlands, Germany, and the UK are contrasted in some detail, especially in relation to degrees of interventionism. The study concludes that a proposed carbon tax is likely to be favoured as leaving the least footprint of central political authority. However, the Community has also developed considerable informal sophistication to compensate for the formal limitations of its authority over member states.

A structural model of the general system of waste production, handling, and final disposal is needed to define the uncertainties and regulatory options. Current regulatory initiatives are then described and analysed against the foregoing structural analysis. Finally, it is suggested that when one takes into account the scale and particular quality of the uncertainties in hazardous waste life-cycles, the only viable regulatory strategy is one which focuses more attention on the point of production of the wastes and on the organisational milieux. Documentary notification systems are unrealistic; export ban proposals have lacked details.

It analyses the role of formal global energy models in the scenarios and policy conclusions as described in the IIASA Energy System Program's (ESP) own statements. It finds inconsistencies which have confused external audiences, including modelers, as to the importance of properties of formal models in generating authority for policy conclusions. The analysis finds two contradictory images of scientific authority pervading the ESP's published accounts. This article argues that models are more symbolic vehicles for gaining authority than objective technical frameworks. Whilst this is in principle legitimate, it means that the internal processes (and not just the products) of modeling projects are a legitimate subject of public evaluation. Due attention must therefore be paid to the quality and disclosure of such processes. The institutional process of analysis reflects a particular policy style itself and constrains what policies are even conceivable. Claims to scientific analysis and definition of policy problems are themselves symptomatic of a policy framework which is biased at a deeper level than that of specific prescriptions. © 1984 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.",,,,,,,,"Archibald, K., The pitfalls of language or analysis through the looking glass (1980) The Pitfalls of Analysis, , G., Majone, E., Quade, Wiley, Chichester; Atom, (1981).

Okrent restricts himself to what we might call “collective physical risk on a large scale”—eg an airliner crashing rather than a single seaterOkrent, Comment on societal risk (1980) Science, 208, pp. 372-375. , In an entirely different perspective, multinational corporations operating in political environments which pose threats to their operations have demanded ‘political risks’ funds from governments in case those threats materialize. I am talking about the risks of unacceptable social and political changes arising from technological commitments. In his discussion of the intuitive elements of risk perception, Starr identifies the two main aspects as ‘catastrophic potential and lack of control’, the latter apparently meaning large uncertainty and divided expert opinion, von Winterfeldt and Otway have given a more complete and genuinely sociological outline of possible risks (see reference 17) and similar factors have been discussed by K.

However the consequences of excessive dogma in science are usually less directly harmful and politically provocative than the same processes in a technological communityKuhn, (1978) The Essential Tension, , University of Chicago Press; Pfeffer, Management as symbolic action: the creation and maintenance of organisational paradigm (1980) Research in Organisational Behaviour, 3, pp. 1-52. , L.

Is there a form of accountability where feedback from the effects of social alienation leads to its reduction? I am grateful to Mike Thompson and Jim Vaupel for raising this issue. My own feelings are perhaps less sanguine than theirs, in that although there may be periodic fluctuations brought about by such events, the flow of all the other pressures will tend to make these temporary, and the other consequences such as mistrust only likely to cancel them out; Daly, Specters of technicism (1970) Psychiatry, 33, pp. 417-431. , For interesting discussions of these psychological or spiritual dimensions of popular attitudes, see; Price, Political frameworks for the control of technology: an assessment (1980) Directing Technology, , P. Gummet, R. Johnston, Croom Helm, London, In analysing the public response to technological decisions it might be useful to think in terms of the disorientation which people experience in total institutions, such as prisons, mental hospitals etc. In such circumstances the inmate's identity is destroyed by various rituals and there results the strong tendency for the inmate to become morally subsumed—completely malleable to the institution. The analogy breaks down to the extent to which the decisionmaking system on which I am focusing is more obscure and unintelligible, leading to fundamental disorientation; Goffman, (1969) Asylums, , See eg, Penguin, Harmondsworth; Pomato, Seveso-safety in numbers?

There is a potentially important though as yet unrealized correspondence between many of the insights from the psychological research which has influenced risk analysis and the sociological analysis of scientific rationality. The tendency in the literature is to regard bias or mistakes as individual and isolated in origin, which suggests that ideal objective scientific knowledge can be attained in professional practice and as an input to policy issues.",,"ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION - Legislation; ANTHROPOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS; EXPERTISE ROLE; POLITICAL FACTORS; PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH; RISK PERCEPTIONS; SCIENCE MODEL IMPLICATIONS; ACCIDENT PREVENTION",,,,,,,"Wynne, Brian; Univ of Lancaster, Lancaster, Engl, Univ of Lancaster, Lancaster, Engl",,"Int Inst for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria","Springer-Verlag, Berlin, West Ger","Risk Analysis Controversy: An Institutional Perspective, Proceedings of a Summer Study on Decision Processes and Institutional Aspects of Risk.",,"Laxenberg, Austria",4606,,3540120122,,,"English",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020219310
