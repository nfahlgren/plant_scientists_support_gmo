We show here that this expanded tropism of oncolytic vaccinia virus to the endothelial compartment is a consequence of VEGF-mediated suppression of the intrinsic antiviral response. VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling through Erk1/2 and Stat3 leads to upregulation, nuclear localization, and activation of the transcription repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp1. PRD1-BF1 does not contribute to the mitogenic effects of VEGF, but directly represses genes involved in type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling. In vivo suppression of VEGF signaling diminishes PRD1-BF1/Blimp1 expression in tumor vasculature and inhibits intravenously administered oncolytic vaccinia delivery to and consequent spread within the tumor. Arulanandam et al. show that VEGFR2 signaling in remodelling vessels induces the transcription repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp1, which represses the expression of genes involved in type I interferon-mediated antiviral signaling, thus allowing oncolytic virus to infect tumor vasculatures to further spread within tumors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,"B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1; bevacizumab; brivanib; caspase 3; interferon; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; monoclonal antibody DC101; oncolytic virus; recombinant vasculotropin; STAT1 protein; STAT3 protein; vasculotropin 165; adaptive immunity; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral activity; Article; cancer immunotherapy; cell activation; cell differentiation; colon carcinoma; controlled study; drug delivery system; endothelium cell; enzyme activation; enzyme repression; gene ontology; gene silencing; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; human; human cell; immune response; immunomodulation; immunosuppressive treatment; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein DNA binding; protein expression; protein induction; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein secretion; signal transduction; tumor vascularization; umbilical vein endothelial cell; upregulation; vaccinia; Vaccinia virus; vascular remodeling; viral tropism; virus inhibition; virus replication; virus virulence; wound healing; Vaccinia virus",,"bevacizumab, 216974-75-3; brivanib, 649735-46-6; caspase 3, 169592-56-7; mitogen activated protein kinase 1, 137632-08-7; mitogen activated protein kinase 3, 137632-07-6",,,,"Assi, H.H., Paran, C., VanderVeen, N., Savakus, J., Doherty, R., Petruzzella, E., Hoeschele, J.D., Mikkelsen, T., Preclinical characterization of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 small molecule inhibitors for primary and metastatic brain cancer therapy (2014) J.

Oncogenes such as the middle Tumor antigen of polyoma virus (mT) are known to suppress gap junctional, intercellular communication (GJIC). mT associates with and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by cSrc family members. Specific mT phosphotyrosines provide docking sites for the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc (mT-tyr250) or the SH2 domain of the regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3k, mT-tyr315). Binding results in the activation of their downstream signaling cascades, Ras/Raf/Erk and PI3 kinase/Akt, respectively, both of which are needed for full neoplastic transformation.To examine the effect of mT-initiated pathways upon gap junctional communication, GJIC was quantitated in rat liver epithelial T51B cells expressing mT-mutants, using a novel technique of in situ electroporation. The results demonstrate for the first time that, although even low levels of wild-type mT are sufficient to interrupt gap junctional communication, GJIC suppression still requires an intact tyr-250 site, that is activation of the Ras pathway. In sharp contrast, activation of the PI3k pathway is not required for GJIC suppression, indicating that GJIC suppression is independent of full neoplastic conversion and the concomitant morphological changes. Interestingly, expression of a constitutively active, myristylated form of the catalytic subunit of PI3k, p110, or the constitutively active mutants E545K and H1047R increased GJIC, while pharmacological inhibition of PI3k eliminated communication. Therefore, although PI3k is growth promoting and in an activated form it can act as an oncogene, it actually plays a positive role upon gap junctional, intercellular communication. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Electroporation in situ; Gap junctions; Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; Polyoma virus transformation; Ras pathway; Src","phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; tumor antigen; 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; androstane derivative; chromone derivative; morpholine derivative; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein binding; protein p21; virus T antigen; wortmannin; animal cell; Article; cell communication; controlled study; electroporation; enzyme active site; epithelium cell; gap junction; liver cell; mutant; nonhuman; oncogene; Polyomavirus; priority journal; rat; wild type; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; cell communication; cell line; cell transformation; cytology; gap junction; genetics; liver; metabolism; mutation; signal transduction; Polyomavirus; Rattus; Androstadienes; Animals; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Cell Communication; Cell Line; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Chromones; Electroporation; Gap Junctions; Liver; Morpholines; Mutation; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Binding; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Rats; Signal Transduction",,"phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; protein p21, 85306-28-1; wortmannin, 19545-26-7; 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; Androstadienes; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Chromones; Morpholines; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); wortmannin",,,,"Aleshin, A., Finn, R.S., SRC: a century of science brought to the clinic (2010) Neoplasia, 12, pp. 599-607; Anagnostopoulou, A., Cao, J., Vultur, A., Firth, K.L., Raptis, L., Examination of gap junctional, intercellular communication by in situ electroporation on two co-planar indium-tin oxide electrodes (2007) Mol.

A variety of molecules, such as peptides or oligonucleotides can be introduced into essentially 100% of the cells in a non-traumatic manner. Here, we describe how it can be used to study intercellular, gap junctional communication. Lucifer yellow penetrates into the cells when an electric pulse, applied to the conductive surface on which they are growing, causes pores to form through the cell membrane. This is electroporation Cells growing on the nonconductive glass surface immediately adjacent to the electroporated region do not take up Lucifer yellow by electroporation but do acquire the fluorescent dye as it is passed to them via gap junctions that link them to the electroporated cells. The results of the transfer of dye from cell to cell can be observed microscopically under fluorescence illumination. This technique allows for precise quantitation of gap junctional communication. In addition, it can be used for the introduction of peptides or other non-permeant molecules, and the transfer of small electroporated peptides via gap junctions to inhibit the signal in the adjacent, non-electroporated cells is a powerful demonstration of signal inhibition. © JoVE 2006-2014.

A reduction in gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) correlates with high cell proliferation, while oncogene products such as Src suppress GJIC, through the Ras/Raf/Erk and other effector pathways. High Src activity was found to correlate with high levels of the Src effector, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (Stat3) in its tyrosine-705 phosphorylated, i.e., transcriptionally activated form, in the majority of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer lines examined. However, Stat3 inhibition did not restore GJIC in lines with high Src activity. In the contrary, Stat3 inhibition in normal cells or in lines with low Src activity and high GJIC eliminated gap junctional communication. Therefore, despite the fact that Stat3 is growth promoting and in an activated form acts like an oncogene, it is actually required for junctional permeability.","Connexin43; Gap junctions; Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3","connexin 43; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein tyrosine kinase; Raf protein; Ras protein; STAT3 protein; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cell activity; cell communication; cell density; cell interaction; cell proliferation; cell transformation; gap junction; gene activation; gene activity; gene product; human; lung alveolus epithelium; lung non small cell cancer; nonhuman; oncogene src; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; review; signal transduction; transcription initiation; transcription regulation; upregulation",,"mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; protein tyrosine kinase, 80449-02-1",,,,"Sohl, G., Willecke, K., An update on connexin genes and their nomenclature in mouse and man (2003) Cell Commun.

The constitutive activation of STAT3 is present in several cancers, including gliomas (GBMs), and is associated with poor therapeutic responses. Phosphorylation of STAT3 triggers its dimerization and nuclear transport, where it promotes the transcription of genes that stimulate tumor growth. In light of this role, inhibitors of the STAT3 pathway are attractive therapeutic targets for cancer. To this end, we evaluated the STAT3-inhibitory activities of three compounds (CPA-7 [trichloronitritodiammineplatinum(IV)], WP1066 [(S,E)-3-(6-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2- cyano-N-(1-phenylethyl)acrylamide, C17H14BrN 3O], and ML116 [4-benzyl-1-{thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl}piperidine, C18H19N3S]) in cultured rodent and human glioma cells, including GBM cancer stem cells. Our results demonstrate a potent induction of growth arrest in GBM cells after drug treatment with a concomitant induction of cell death. Although these compounds were effective at inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation, they also displayed variable dose-dependent inhibition of STAT1, STAT5, and nuclear factor κ light-chain enhancer of activated B cells. The therapeutic efficacy of these compounds was further evaluated in peripheral and intracranial mouse tumor models. Whereas CPA-7 elicited regression of peripheral tumors, both melanoma and GBM, its efficacy was not evident when the tumors were implanted within the brain. Our data suggest poor permeability of this compound to tumors located within the central nervous system. WP1066 and ML116 exhibited poor in vivo efficacy. In summary, CPA-7 constitutes a powerful anticancer agent in models of peripheral solid cancers. Our data strongly support further development of CPA- 7-derived compounds with increased permeability to enhance their efficacy in primary and metastatic brain tumors.

Since a number of oncogenes besides SRC can affect GJIC, here we examined the actual contribution of the SRC/STAT3 axis to GJIC suppression. Materials and Methods: SRC and STAT3 activity levels were examined in SK-LuCi-6, LC-T, QU-DB, SW-1573, BH-E, Calu-6, FR-E, SK-MES, H1299, BEN, WT-E, A549 and SHP-77 cells by western blott analysis, probing with antibodies specific for SRC-ptyr418 or STAT3-ptyr705. GJIC was examined by in situ electroporation. Results: Confluence of all cultured NSCLC cells tested induces a dramatic increase in STAT3 activity, which is independent of SRC action. In addition, the LC-T line had high STAT3-705, despite the fact that SRC-418 expression was low, indicating that other, SRC-independent factors must be responsible for STAT3 activation and GJIC suppression in these cells; however, BH-E and SHP-77 cells with low GJIC, both SRC-418 and STAT3-705 expression were low, indicating that GJIC suppression can be independent of the SRC/STAT3 axis altogether. Our results also show that STAT3 inhibition does not restore GJIC in any of the examined lines, while in the non-transformed rat F111 fibroblast line which has extensive GJIC, STAT3 inhibition actually eliminated junctional permeability. Conclusion: Our results indicate a further level of complexity in the relationship between SRC, STAT3 and GJIC in NSCLC than what has been previously demonstrated. In addition, STAT3 is actually required for, rather than suppressing GJIC.","Gap junctions; In situ electroporation; Lung cancer; SRC; STAT3","dasatinib; oncoprotein; SRC protein; STAT3 protein; tyrosine kinase receptor;

We recently demonstrated that engagement of E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent, cell to cell adhesion molecule which is often required for cells to remain tightly associated within the epithelium, also activates Stat3. We now examined the effect of two other classical cadherins, cadherin-11 and N-cadherin, whose expression often correlates with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition occurring in metastasis of carcinoma cells, upon Stat3 phosphorylation and activity. Our results indicate that engagement of these two cadherins also, can trigger a dramatic surge in Stat3 activity. This activation occurs through upregulation of members of the IL6 family of cytokines, and it is necessary for cell survival, proliferation and migration. Interestingly, our results also demonstrate for the first time that, in sharp contrast to Stat3, the activity of Erk (Extracellular Signal Regulated kinase) was unaffected by cadherin-11 engagement. Further examination indicated that, although IL6 was able to activate Erk in sparsely growing cells, IL6 could not induce an increase in Erk activity levels in densely growing cultures. Most importantly, cadherin-11 knock-down did allow Erk activation by IL6 at high densities, indicating that it is indeed cadherin engagement that prevents Erk activation by IL6. The fact that the three classical cadherins tested so far, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and cadherin11, which are present in essentially all tissues, actually activate Stat3 regardless of their role in metastasis, argues for Stat3 as a central survival, rather than invasion factor. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Cadherin; Epithelial cell; Rho GTPase; Signal transduction; Stat3","cadherin; cadherin 11; glycoprotein gp 130; interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; nerve cell adhesion molecule; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; animal cell; article; carcinoma cell; cell culture; cell density; cell growth; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene silencing; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; upregulation; Animals; BALB 3T3 Cells; Cadherins; cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein; Cell Adhesion; Cell Division; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Survival; Cytokine Receptor gp130; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinases; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Neuropeptides; NF-kappa B; rac GTP-Binding Proteins; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Up-Regulation",,"mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; uvomorulin, 112956-45-3; Cadherins; Cdc42 protein, mouse; Cdh2 protein, mouse; Cytokine Receptor gp130, 133483-10-0; GTP Phosphohydrolases, 3.6.1.-; Il6st protein, mouse; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinases, 2.7.10.2; NF-kappa B; Neuropeptides; Rac1 protein, mouse; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Stat3 protein, mouse; cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein, 3.6.5.2; osteoblast cadherin, 156621-71-5; rac GTP-Binding Proteins, 3.6.5.2",,,,"Stemmler, M.P., Cadherins in development and cancer (2008) Mol.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed high Src activity in NSCLC biopsy samples compared to normal tissues. Here we explored the potential effect of Src and Stat3 upon GJIC, by assessing the levels of tyr418-phosphorylated Src and tyr705-phosphorylated Stat3, respectively, in a panel of NSCLC cell lines.Methods: Gap junctional communication was examined by electroporating the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow into cells grown on a transparent electrode, followed by observation of the migration of the dye to the adjacent, non-electroporated cells under fluorescence illumination.Results: An inverse relationship between Src activity levels and GJIC was noted; in five lines with high Src activity GJIC was absent, while two lines with extensive GJIC (QU-DB and SK-LuCi6) had low Src levels, similar to a non-transformed, immortalised lung epithelial cell line. Interestingly, examination of the mechanism indicated that Stat3 inhibition in any of the NSCLC lines expressing high endogenous Src activity levels, or in cells where Src was exogenously transduced, did not restore GJIC. On the contrary, Stat3 downregulation in immortalised lung epithelial cells or in the NSCLC lines displaying extensive GJIC actually suppressed junctional permeability.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that although Stat3 is generally growth promoting and in an activated form it can act as an oncogene, it is actually required for gap junctional communication both in nontransformed lung epithelial cells and in certain lung cancer lines that retain extensive GJIC. © 2012 Geletu et al.;

A reduction in gap junctional, intercellular communication (GJIC) often correlates with increased growth and neoplastic transformation. Cx43 is a widely expressed connexin which can be phosphorylated by the Src oncoprotein tyrosine kinase on tyr247 and -265, and this reduces communication. However, Src activates multiple signalling pathways such as the Ras/Raf/Erk and PLCγ/protein kinase C, which can also phosphorylate Cx43 and interrupt communication. In addition, the Src effector Cas, which has an adaptor function, binds Cx43 to suppress gap junctional communication. In sharp contrast, activation of a different Src effector, the cytoplasmic transcription factor Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) is not required for the Src-mediated, GJIC suppression. In fact, Stat3 is actually required for the maintenance of gap junctional communication in normal cells with high GJIC.","Cx43; Gap junctional intercellular communication; Src oncogene","connexin 43;

One roadblock is the lack of semi-quantitative methods which reliably measure biomarker expression. Our study assesses reliability of automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring compared to manual scoring of five selected biomarkers in a tissue microarray (TMA) of 63 human breast cancer cases, and correlates these markers with clinico-pathological data. TMA slides were scanned into an Ariol Imaging System, and histologic (H) scores (% positive tumor area x staining intensity 0-3) were calculated using trained algorithms. H scores for all five biomarkers concurred with pathologists' scores, based on Pearson correlation coefficients (0.80-0.90) for continuous data and Kappa statistics (0.55-0.92) for positive vs. negative stain. Using continuous data, significant association of pERK expression with absence of LVI (p = 0.005) and lymph node negativity (p = 0.002) was observed. p53 over-expression, characteristic of dysfunctional p53 in cancer, and Ki67 were associated with high grade (p = 0.032 and 0.0007, respectively). Cyclin D1 correlated inversely with ER/PR/HER2-ve (triple negative) tumors (p = 0.0002). Thus automated quantitation of immunostaining concurs with pathologists' scoring, and provides meaningful associations with clinico-pathological data. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Automated image analysis; Breast cancer; Clinico-pathological parameters; P53/cyclin D1/Ki67/pERK; Tissue microarray","cyclin D1; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; Ki 67 antigen; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein p53; tumor marker; accuracy; adult; article; autoanalysis; breast cancer; cancer grading; cancer staging; controlled study; disease association; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; intermethod comparison; lymph node; major clinical study; pathologist; prediction; protein analysis; protein expression; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; tissue microarray; tumor volume; validation process",,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2, 137632-09-8; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5",,,,"Dancey, J.E., Chen, H.X., Strategies for optimizing combinations of molecularly targeted anticancer agents (2006) Nat.

Overactivation of Stat3 is detected with high frequency in human cancer and is considered a molecular abnormality that supports the tumor phenotype. Despite concerted investigative efforts, the molecular mechanisms leading to the aberrant Stat3 activation and Stat3-mediated transformation and tumorigenesis are still not clearly defined. Recent evidence reveals a crosstalk close relationship between Stat3 signaling and members of the Rho family of small GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA. Specifically, Rac1, acting in a complex with the MgcRacGAP (male germ cell RacGAP), promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 by the IL6-receptor family/Jak kinase complex, as well as its translocation to the nucleus. Studies have further revealed that the mutational activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 results in Stat3 activation, which occurs in part through the upregulation of IL6 family cytokines that in turn stimulates Stat3 through the Jak kinases. Interestingly, evidence also shows that the engagement of cadherins, cell to cell adhesion molecules, specifically induces a striking increase in Rac1 and Cdc42 protein levels and activity, which in turn results in Stat3 activation. In this review we integrate recent findings clarifying the role of the Rho family GTPases in Stat3 activation in the context of malignant progression. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","MgcRacGAP; Rho GTPases; Stat3","cadherin; interleukin 6; protein Cdc42; Rac1 protein; Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; STAT3 protein; carcinogenesis; cell adhesion; cytoplasm; genetic transcription; macrophage; mutation; neoplasm; phenotype; priority journal; protein binding; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein transport; review; signal transduction; Animals; Cytokines; Humans; Models, Biological; Neoplasms; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; STAT3 Transcription Factor",,"Cytokines; STAT3 Transcription Factor; rho GTP-Binding Proteins, 3.6.5.2",,,,"Anagnostopoulou, A., Vultur, A., Arulanandam, R., Cao, J., Turkson, J., Jove, R., Kim, J.S., Raptis, L., Differential effects of Stat3 inhibition in sparse vs confluent normal and breast cancer cells (2006) Cancer Lett., 242, pp. 120-132; Arulanandam, R., Geletu, M., Feracci, H., Raptis, L., RacV12 requires gp130 for Stat3 activation, cell proliferation and migration (2010) Exp.

We identified two phosphorylated forms of TRIM59 (p53 and p55) and characterized them using purified TRIM59 proteins from mouse prostate cancer models at different stages with wild-type mice and NIH3T3 cells as controls. p53/p55-TRIM59 proteins possibly represent Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphorylation modifications, respectively. Quantitative measurements by ELISA showed that the p-Ser/Thr TRIM59 correlated with tumorigenesis, whereas the p-Tyr-TRIM59 protein correlated with advanced cancer of the prostate (CaP). The function of TRIM59 was elucidated using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of the gene in human CaP cells, which caused S-phase cell-cycle arrest and cell growth retardation. A hit-and-run effect of TRIM59 shRNA knockdown was observed 24 hours posttransfection. Differential cDNA microarrray analysis was conducted, which showed that the initial and rapid knockdown occurred early in the Ras signaling pathway. To confirm the proto-oncogenic function of TRIM59 in the Ras signaling pathway, we generated a transgenic mouse model using a prostate tissue - specific gene (PSP94) to direct the upregulation of the TRIM59 gene. Restricted TRIM59 gene upregulation in the prostate revealed the full potential for inducing tumorigenesis, similar to the expression of SV40 Tag, and coincided with the upregulation of genes specific to the Ras signaling pathway and bridging genes for SV40 Tag - mediated oncogenesis. The finding of a possible novel oncogene in animal models will implicate a novel strategy for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy for cancer. ©2011 AACR.",,"beta microseminoprotein; complementary DNA; oncoprotein;

Recently, TAZ has also been identified as a major component of the novel Hippo-LATS tumor suppressor pathway and to function as an oncogene in breast cancer. We show for the first time that TAZ is an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our results show that TAZ is overexpressed in NSCLC cells and that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of TAZ in HBE135 immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells causes increased cell proliferation and transformation, which can be restored back to its original levels by knockdown of TAZ. In addition, short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of TAZ expression in NSCLC cells suppresses their proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and tumor growth in mice in vivo, which can be reversed by re-introduction of shRNA-resistant TAZ into TAZ-knockdown NSCLC cells. These results indicate that TAZ is an oncogene and has an important role in tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells. Therefore, TAZ may present a novel target for the future diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of lung cancer. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","cell proliferation; Hippo-LATS pathway;

In addition to activating hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), cells also respond to hypoxia by globally inhibiting protein synthesis via serine 51 phosphorylation of translation eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). In this study, we investigated potential roles for stress-activated eIF2α kinases in regulation of HIF-1α. Our investigations revealed that the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) plays a significant role in suppressing HIF-1α expression, acting specifically at the level of transcription. HIF-1α transcriptional repression by PKR was sufficient to impair the hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1α and transcriptional induction of HIF-1α-dependent target genes. Inhibition of HIF-1A transcription by PKR was independent of eIF2α phosphorylation but dependent on inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Furthermore, HIF-1A repression required the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, which acts downstream of PKR, to suppress Stat3.

K7L 3N6, Canada","Rac1 (Rac) is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases which controls cell migration by regulating the organization of actin filaments. Previous results suggested that mutationally activated forms of the Rho GTPases can activate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (Stat3), but the exact mechanism is a matter of controversy. We recently demonstrated that Stat3 activity of cultured cells increases dramatically following E-cadherin engagement. To better understand this pathway, we now compared Stat3 activity levels in mouse HC11 cells before and after expression of the mutationally activated Rac1 (RacV12), at different cell densities. The results revealed for the first time a dramatic increase in protein levels and activity of both the endogenous Rac and RacV12 with cell density, which was due to inhibition of proteasomal degradation. In addition, RacV12-expressing cells had higher Stat3, tyrosine-705 phosphorylation and activity levels at all densities, indicating that RacV12 is able to activate Stat3. Further examination of the mechanism of Stat3 activation showed that RacV12 expression caused a surge in mRNA of Interleukin-6 (IL6) family cytokines, known potent Stat3 activators. Knockdown of gp130, the common subunit of this family reduced Stat3 activity, indicating that these cytokines may be responsible for the Stat3 activation by RacV12. The upregulation of IL6 family cytokines was required for cell migration and proliferation induced by RacV12, as shown by gp130 knockdown experiments, thus demonstrating that the gp130/Stat3 axis represents an essential effector of activated Rac for the regulation of key cellular functions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism by which Src and p53 play antagonistic roles in cell invasion is unknown. Here we show that the Stat3 oncogene is a required downstream effector of Src in inducing podosome structures and related invasive phenotypes. Stat3 promotes Src phenotypes through the suppression of p53 and the p53-inducible protein caldesmon, a known podosome antagonist. In contrast, enhanced p53 attenuates Stat3 function and Srcinduced podosome formation by upregulating the tumor suppressor PTEN. PTEN, through the inactivation of Src/Stat3 function, also stabilizes the podosome-antagonizing p53/caldesmon axis, thereby further enhancing the anti-invasive potential of the cell. Furthermore, the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN plays a major role in the negative regulation of the Src/Stat3 pathway and represses podosome formation. Our data suggest that cellular invasiveness is dependent on the balance between two opposing forces: the proinvasive oncogenes Src-Stat3 and the anti-invasive tumor suppressors p53-PTEN.

Materials and Methods: cSrc activity was measured in cells expressing wildtype or mutant TAg and compared to the parental line. Results: The results indicated that TAg expression in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts causes a dramatic increase in cSrc activity, a finding which establishes TAg as a cSrc activator. This ability depended upon a TAg, intact retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product (Rb) family-binding site. In addition, genetic ablation of pRb in mouse fibroblasts increased cSrc activity, suggesting that pRb inactivation by TAg might be responsible for the observed cSrc activation. Furthermore, down-regulation or genetic ablation of cSrc alone, or together with the Src family members, Yes and Fyn, caused a dramatic reduction in the ability of TAg to transform mouse fibroblasts. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest for the first time that cSrc is part of an important pathway emanating from TAg and leading to neoplastic conversion.","cSrc; Neoplastic transformation;

In this review, we discuss recent evidence of dramatic changes in the activity of an important signal transducer found to be profoundly affected by cell to cell adhesion, the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3). Direct cadherin engagement, growth of cells to postconfluence, or formation of multicellular aggregates were found to induce a striking increase in the levels of Stat3 activity, Racl/Cdc42, and members of the IL6 receptor family in different settings. This activation was specific to Stat3, in that the levels of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erkl/2), a signal transducer often coordinately activated with Stat3 by a number of growth factors or oncogenes, remained unaffected by cell density. Density-dependent Stat3 activation may play a key role in survival, and could contribute to the establishment of cell polarity. It is clear that at any given time the total Stat3 activity levels in a cell are the sum of the effects of cell to cell adhesion plus the conventional Stat3 activating factors present.","Cell survival; E-cadherin; Racl/Cdc42; Signal transduction; Stat3","Activity levels; Cell density; Cell polarity; Cell survival; Cellular process; Density-dependent; E-cadherin; E-cadherins; Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Growth factor; Growth of cells; Normal tissue; Signal transducers; Adhesion; Agglomeration; Bacteriophages; Cell adhesion; Chemical activation; Enzyme activity; Oncogenic viruses; Transducers; Signal transduction; cadherin; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein Cdc42; Rac1 protein; STAT3 protein; cell adhesion; cell density; cell differentiation; cell polarity; epithelium cell; human; nonhuman; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; short survey; signal transduction; Animals; Autocrine Communication; Cadherins; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinase 1; rac1 GTP-Binding Protein; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor",,"mitogen activated protein kinase 1, 137632-08-7; mitogen activated protein kinase 3, 137632-07-6; Cadherins; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinase 1, 2.7.10.1; STAT3 Transcription Factor; rac1 GTP-Binding Protein, 3.6.5.2",,,,"Alattia, J.R., Ames, J.B., Porumb, T., Tong, K.I., Heng, Y.M., Ottensmeyer, P., Lateral self-assembly of E-cadherin directed by cooperative calcium binding (1997) FEBS Lett, 417 (3), pp. 405-408. , PMID:9409761, doi:10.1016/50014-5793(97)01333-1; Amin, H.M., McDonnell, T.J., Ma, Y., Lin, Q., Fujio, Y., Kunisada, K., Selective inhibition of STAT3 induces apoptosis and G(1) cell cycle arrest in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (2004) Oncogene, 23 (32), pp. 5426-5434. , PMID:15184887, doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1207703; Anagnostopoulou, A., Vultur, A., Arulanandam, R., Cao, J., Turkson, J., Jove, R., Differential effects of Stat3 inhibition in sparse vs confluent normal and breast cancer cells (2006) Cancer Lett, 242 (1), pp. 120-132. , PMID:16377083, doi:10.1016/j.canlet.2005.10.047; Arulanandam, R., Vultur, A., Cao, J., Carefoot, E., Elliott, B.E., Truesdell, P.F., Cadherin-cadherin engagement promotes cell survival via Rac1/Cdc42 and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (2009) Mol.

In the present report, we show that Stat3 can also be activated through homophilic interactions by the epithelial (E)-cadherin. Indeed, by plating cells onto surfaces coated with fragments encompassing the two outermost domains of this cadherin, we clearly show that cadherin engagement can activate Stat3, even in the absence of direct cell-to-cell contact. Most importantly, our results also reveal for the first time an unexpected and dramatic surge in total Rac1 and Cdc42 protein levels triggered by cadherin engagement and an increase in Rac1 and Cdc42 activity, which is responsible for the Stat3 stimulation observed. Inhibition of cadherin interactions using a peptide, a soluble cadherin fragment, or genetic ablation induced apoptosis, points to a significant role of this pathway in cell survival signaling, a finding that could also have important therapeutic implications.

One of the Src effector pathways leading to GJIC suppression and transformation is the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk, so that inhibition of this pathway in vSrc-transformed cells restores GJIC. A distinct Src downstream effector required for neoplasia is the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3). To examine the role of Stat3 upon the Src-mediated, GJIC suppression, Stat3 was downregulated in rat liver epithelial cells expressing activated Src through treatment with the CPA7, Stat3 inhibitor, or through infection with a retroviral vector expressing a Stat3-specific shRNA. GJIC was examined by electroporating the fluorescent dye, Lucifer yellow, into cells grown on two coplanar electrodes of electrically conductive, optically transparent, indium-tin oxide, followed by observation of the migration of the dye to the adjacent, nonelectroporated cells under fluorescence illumination. The results demonstrate that, contrary to inhibition of the Ras pathway, Stat3 inhibition in cells expressing activated Src does not restore GJIC. On the contrary, Stat3 inhibition in normal cells with high GJIC levels eliminated junctional permeability. Therefore, Stat3's function is actually required for the maintenance of junctional permeability, although Stat3 generally promotes growth and in an activated form can act as an oncogene. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2009.",,"luciferase;

Although the introduction of DNA is a common use, the technique of electroporation in situ is valuable for studying many aspects of signal transduction. This is because, under the appropriate conditions, in situ electroporation can be remarkably nontraumatic, while a large variety of molecules, such as peptides, oligonucleotides, or drugs, are introduced instantly and into essentially 100% of the cells, making this technique especially suitable for kinetic studies of effector activation. Following the introduction of the material, the cells can be either extracted or biochemically analyzed, or their morphology and gene expression can be examined by immunocytochemistry. In this chapter, we describe the introduction of a peptide blocking the Src-homology 2 domain of the adaptor Grb2 to inhibit the activation of the downstream effector Erk1/2 by EGF. The setup includes nonelectroporated, control cells growing side by side with the electroporated ones on the same type of ITO-coated surface. In a modified version, this assembly can be used very effectively for studying intercellular, junctional communication: cells are grown on a glass slide half of which is ITO-coated. An electric pulse is applied in the presence of the fluorescent dye lucifer yellow, causing its penetration into the cells growing on the conductive part of the slide, and the migration of the dye to the nonelectroporated cells growing on the nonconductive area is microscopically observed under fluorescence illumination.",,"biomaterial; fluorescent dye; Grb2 protein, mouse; growth factor receptor bound protein 2; indium tin oxide; isoquinoline derivative; lucifer yellow; peptide; tin derivative; animal; article; cell adhesion; cell communication; cell junction; cell strain 3T3; chemistry; drug antagonism; drug effect; electrode; electroporation; instrumentation; methodology; mouse; physiology; signal transduction; Src homology domain; Animals; Cell Adhesion; Cell Communication; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Electrodes; Electroporation; Fluorescent Dyes; Gap Junctions; GRB2 Adaptor Protein; Isoquinolines; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; NIH 3T3 Cells; Peptides; Signal Transduction; src Homology Domains; Tin Compounds",,"growth factor receptor bound protein 2, 148266-08-4; lucifer yellow, 67769-47-5, 82446-52-4; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Fluorescent Dyes; GRB2 Adaptor Protein; Grb2 protein, mouse; indium tin oxide, 71243-84-0; Isoquinolines; lucifer yellow, 77944-88-8; Peptides; Tin Compounds",,,,,"Raptis, L.",,,,,,,,10643745,,,18370198,"English","Methods Mol.

Different configurations were subsequently developed for the electroporation of adherent cells in situ, while the cells were growing on nonconductive surfaces or a gold-coated, conductive support. We developed an assembly where the cells grow and are electroporated on optically transparent, electrically conductive indium-tin oxide (ITO). This material promotes excellent cell adhesion and growth, is inert and durable, and does not display spontaneous fluorescence, making the examination of the electroporated cells by fluorescence microscopy possible. The molecules to be electroporated are added to the cells and introduced through an electrical pulse delivered by an electrode placed on top of the cells. We describe several electrode and slide configurations which allow the electroporation of large numbers of cells for large-scale biochemical experiments or for the detection of changes in cell morphology and biochemical properties in situ, with control, nonelectroporated cells growing on the same type of ITO-coated surface, side by side with the electroporated ones.

We previously described a powerful technique where gap junctional, intercellular communication (GJIC) of adherent cells can be examined by in situ electroporation on a slide, part of which is coated with electrically conductive and transparent indium-tin oxide. An electric pulse is applied through an electrode placed on the cells in the presence of the tracking dye, Lucifer yellow (LY). The pulse causes LY's penetration into the cells growing on the conductive part of the slide, and the subsequent migration of the dye to the non-electroporated cells growing on the non-conductive area is microscopically observed under fluorescence illumination. Although this technique is adequate for a number of cell lines, the turbulence generated as the electrode is removed can cause cell detachment, which makes GJIC examination problematic. In this communication, we describe a slide configuration where junctional communication can be examined in the absence of an upper electrode: Cells are grown on two co-planar electrodes separated by a barrier which diverts the electric field, rendering it vertical to the cell layer. The elimination of an upper electrode is especially valuable for the electroporation of sensitive cells, such as terminally differentiated adipocytes. This technique can also be used for the introduction of other non-permeant molecules such as peptides or siRNA, followed by examination of the cellular phenotype or gene expression levels in situ. © 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.","Adherent cells; Adipocytes; Electroporation; Gap junctions","lucifer yellow; adipocyte; article; cell communication; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell membrane permeability; cell migration; conductance; electric field; electroporation; fluorescence; gap junction; human; human cell; illumination; microscopy; priority journal; 3T3-L1 Cells; Animals; Cell Communication; Electrodes; Electroporation; Fluorescent Dyes; Gap Junctions; Humans; Isoquinolines; Mice; Tin Compounds",,"lucifer yellow, 67769-47-5, 82446-52-4; Fluorescent Dyes; Isoquinolines; Tin Compounds; indium tin oxide, 71243-84-0; lucifer yellow, 77944-88-8",,,,"Anagnostopoulou, A., Vultur, A., Arulanandam, R., Cao, J., Turkson, J., Jove, R., Kim, J.S., Raptis, L., Differential effects of Stat3 inhibition in sparse vs confluent normal and breast cancer cells (2006) Cancer Lett., 242, pp. 120-132; Azarnia, R., Russell, T.R., Cyclic AMP effects on cell-to-cell junctional membrane permeability during adipocytic differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (1985) J.

Progressively higher levels were accompanied by apoptosis induction. To examine the role of the cellular Ras protooncogene product (Ras) in E1A function, E1A was expressed in C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2)-derived preadipocytes rendered deficient in Ras activity by transfection with inducible or constitutive antisense ras gene constructs (Ras-knockdowns). The results showed that, although even low amounts of E1A could block the differentiation of 10T1/2 preadipocytes with normal Ras levels, even the highest E1A levels were unable to block the differentiation or induce transformation of Ras-knockdown preadipocytes. Ras downregulation did not affect E2F activation by E1A. Interestingly, our results further demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the levels of the E1A protein itself as differentiation progressed, with a concomitant reduction in E1A's ability to induce apoptosis as a result. These findings suggest for the first time that Ras, although cytoplasmic, is an integral component of the pathway whereby E1A, an oncoprotein believed to have primarily nuclear targets, suppresses differentiation or induces neoplastic conversion of murine preadipocytes. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adenovirus-5 E1A proteins;

This coating promotes excellent cell adhesion and growth, allows direct visualization of the electroporated cells, and offers the possibility of ready examination due to their extended morphology. The instant introduction of the molecules into essentially 100% of the cells makes this technique especially suitable for kinetic studies of effector activation. Unlike other techniques of cell permeabilization, under the appropriate conditions, in situ electroporation does not affect cell morphology, the length of the G1 phase of serum-stimulated cells. The technique of in situ electroporation can be used equally effectively for large-scale biochemical experiments. Growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulate cell proliferation by binding to, and activating, membrane receptors with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains. Assessment of Erk activity by Western blotting following electroporation of the Grb2-SH2 blocking peptide can reveal the involvement of this domain in growth factor-mediated Erk activation. © 2006 Copyright © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike other techniques of cell membrane permeabilization, such as streptolysin-O (SLO) treatment, in situ electroporation does not detectably affect cellular metabolism, presumably because the pores reseal rapidly so that the cellular interior is restored to its original state. Cells are grown on conductive and transparent glass slides, which are placed in a petri dish to maintain sterility. The cell growth area is defined by a ""window"" formed with an electrically insulating frame made of Teflon. The frame creates a gap between the conductive coating and the negative electrode so that current can only flow through the electroporation fluid and cells growing in the window. A large number of signal transducers are present in small amounts in the cell so that a large number of cells may be required to obtain a strong signal. © 2006 Copyright © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

K7L3N6, Canada","The signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) is persistently activated in many cancers such as cancer of the breast and is required for transformation by a number of oncogenes. Signaling through Stat3 is determined by a key phosphorylation at tyr-705. We previously demonstrated that cell-to-cell adhesion brought about through cell aggregation or confluence of cultured cells causes a dramatic increase in Stat3 tyr705 phosphorylation and consequently Stat3 activity in both normal and tumor cells. To examine the role of Stat3 at specific time-points relative to confluence, we used two different approaches of Stat3 inhibition: (1). Introduction of high levels of peptide analogues, which block the Stat3-SH2 domain, to inhibit Stat3 binding to and phosphorylation by growth factor receptors. (2). Treatment with two platinum compounds which bind the Stat3 protein and inhibit its activity without affecting its phosphorylation directly. The results demonstrate that Stat3 downregulation in vSrc transformed NIH3T3 cells or in breast cancer lines harboring activated Src induces apoptosis, which is evident at all densities but is more pronounced at post-confluence. In normal cells on the other hand, Stat3 inhibition at post-confluence caused apoptosis while in sparsely growing cells it induced merely a growth retardation. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

K7L 3N6, Canada","To investigate the role of Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) in neoplastic transformation by the Large Tumor antigen of Simian Virus 40 (TAg), murine fibroblasts were rendered deficient in Stat3 activity through expression of a Stat3-specific siRNA or a Cre-loxP recombination system. The results demonstrate that growth rate, formation of foci overgrowing a monolayer of normal cells and colony formation in soft agar were dramatically reduced in Stat3-deficient cells. In addition, TAg expression led to increased Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity, suggesting that Stat3 is required for TAg-mediated neoplasia. Stat3 activation was prevented by blocking the binding of TAg to pRb (retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product), whereas genetic ablation of pRb increased Stat3 activity, suggesting that pRb inactivation by TAg might be responsible for the observed Stat3 activation. Stat3 activation by TAg was suppressed after inhibition of c-Src, JAKs or the insulin-like growth factor receptor. On the other hand, targeted disruption of the Fer kinase or pharmacological inhibition of Ab1 had no effect. Inhibition of Src activity led to Stat3 down-regulation as well as apoptosis of sparsely growing, TAg-transformed cells. However, Src inhibition was relatively ineffective in confluent cells, consistent with previous results indicating that cell to cell adhesion activates Stat3 by a Src-independent mechanism. Direct Stat3 inhibition on the other hand induced apoptosis very effectively in confluent cells, which could have significant therapeutic implications. Taken together, our results suggest that Stat3 is an important component of a pathway emanating from TAg and leading to neoplastic conversion. © 2005 by The American Society for Cell Biology.",,"gene product; Janus kinase; protein tyrosine kinase; retinoblastoma protein; small interfering RNA; somatomedin receptor; STAT3 protein; virus large T antigen; animal cell; antigen expression; article; cell adhesion; cell transformation; enzyme inactivation; fibroblast; gene disruption; genetic recombination; malignant transformation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein DNA binding; protein phosphorylation; receptor down regulation; Simian virus 40; Animals; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Cell Line; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice; Phosphotyrosine; Protein Binding; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Retinoblastoma Protein; RNA, Small Interfering; Simian virus 40; Up-Regulation; Murinae; Simian virus 40",,"Janus kinase, 161384-16-3; protein tyrosine kinase, 80449-02-1; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Phosphotyrosine, 21820-51-9; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.112; Retinoblastoma Protein; RNA, Small Interfering",,,,"Akira, S., Roles of STAT3 defined by tissue-specific gene targeting (2000) Oncogene, 19, pp. 2607-2611; Angers-Loustau, A., Hering, R., Werbowetski, T.E., Kaplan, D.R., Del Maestro, R.F., SRC regulates actin dynamics and invasion of malignant glial cells in three dimensions (2004) Mol.

The results demonstrate a dramatic, quantitative reciprocal regulation of differentiation and several transformation-associated properties in response to graded levels of E1A expression, with the suppression of differentiative capacity, focus formation, and anchorage-independent proliferation requiring increasing levels of E1A. Progressively higher E1A levels were accompanied by apoptosis induction. The effect of E1A upon adipocytic differentiation as well as transformation and apoptosis required binding to the retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product. These data reveal a dissociation between E1A signals leading to transformation, suppression of differentiation and induction of apoptosis, based on levels of expression. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adenovirus E1A proteins; Adipocytes; Akt-1 protein kinase; Cell differentiation; E2F proteins","E1A protein; gene product; retinoblastoma protein; Adenovirus 5; adipocyte; animal cell; apoptosis; article; binding affinity; cell anchorage; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell strain 3T3; cell transformation; controlled study; gene control; gene expression; gene repression; genetic susceptibility; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein expression; signal transduction; tumor suppressor gene; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adenovirus E1A Proteins; Adipocytes; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Differentiation; Mice; Mutation; Adenoviridae; Human adenovirus type 5",,"Adenovirus E1A Proteins",,,,"White, E., Regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis by the oncogenes of adenovirus (2001) Oncogene, 20, pp. 7836-7846; Frisch, S.M., Mymryk, J.S., Adenovirus-5 E1A: Paradox and paradigm (2002) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 3, pp. 441-452; Latella, L., Sacchi, A., Crescenzi, M., Long-term fate of terminally differentiated skeletal muscle cells following E1A-initiated cell cycle reactivation (2000) Cell Death Differ, 7, pp. 145-154; Frisch, S.M., E1a induces the expression of epithelial characteristics (1994) J Cell Biol, 127, pp. 1085-1096; Grooteclaes, M.L., Frisch, S.M., Evidence for a function of CtBP in epithelial gene regulation and anoikis (2000) Oncogene, 19, pp. 3823-3828; Tobe, K., Kasuga, M., Kitasato, H., Takaku, F., Takano, T., Segawa, K., Differential effects of DNA tumor virus nuclear oncogene products on adipocyte differentiation (1987) FEBS Lett, 215, pp. 345-349; Crescenzi, M., Soddu, S., Tato, F., Mitotic cycle reactivation in terminally differentiated cells by adenovirus infection (1995) J Cell Physlol, 162, pp. 26-35; Raptis, L., Lamfrom, H., Benjamin, T.L., Regulation of cellular phenotype and expression of polyomavirus middle T antigen in rat fibroblasts (1985) Mol Cell Biol, 5, pp. 2476-2486; Raptis, L., Yang, J., Brownell, H.L., Rasleu61 blocks differentiation of transformable 3T3 L1 and C3HT1/2-derived preadipocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner (1997) Cell Growth Differ, 8, pp. 11-21; Cone, R.D., Grodzicker, T., Jaramillo, M., A retrovirus expressing the 12S adenoviral E1A gene product can immortalize epithelial cells from a broad range of rat tissues (1988) Mol Cell Biol, 8, pp. 1036-1044; Morgenstern, J.P., Land, H., Advanced mammalian gene transfer: High titre retroviral vectors with multiple drug selection markers and a complementary helper-free packaging line (1990) Nucl Acids Res, 18, pp. 3587-3596; Raptis, L., Brownell, H.L., Wood, K., Corbley, M., Wang, D., Haliotis, T., Cellular ras gene activity is required for full neoplastic transformation by Simian Virus 40 (1997) Cell Growth Differ, 8, pp. 891-901; Tiainen, M., Spitkovsky, D., Jansen-Durr, P., Sacchi, A., Crescenzi, M., Expression of E1A in terminally differentiated muscle cells reactivates the cell cycle and suppresses tissue-specific genes by separable mechanisms (1996) Mol Cell Biol, 16, pp. 5302-5312; Raptis, L., Vultur, A., Neoplastic transformation assays (2001) SV40 Protocols, pp. 151-164. , Raptis L.

We previously demonstrated that cell to cell adhesion causes a dramatic increase in Stat3 activity. Given that the opportunities for cell to cell adhesion could be altered due to the presence of the DNA-containing complexes, we examined the effect of the calcium-phosphate transfection procedure upon Stat3 activity levels. The results revealed a dramatic increase in Stat3 phosphorylation at the critical tyr705 site and Stat3 activity following calcium-phosphate transfection. This increase was noted even in the absence of DNA and was not due to the mere presence of calcium ions. In contrast, DNA introduction through electroporation or infection with a retroviral vector did not affect Stat3 activity, while cationic lipids such as lipofectamine or Fugene6 had a less pronounced effect than calcium-phosphate transfection. These results indicate that caution is required in the interpretation of results with regard to activity of Stat3 following certain commonly used transient transfection regimens. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

K7L 3N6, Canada","Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) activity is required for transformation by a number of oncogenes, while a constitutively active form of Stat3 alone is sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation. Although in most instances Stat3 is growth-promoting, the impact of cell density on Stat3 activation status and the biological importance of Stat3 during growth arrest have not been characterized. Previous results indicated that cell density alters tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cultured cells. Since signalling through Stat3 is determined by a key phosphorylation at tyr705, we examined the effects of cell density upon Stat3 activity in normal breast epithelial cells, breast carcinoma lines and normal mouse fibroblasts. Intriguingly, the results revealed a dramatic increase in Stat3, tyr705 phosphorylation and activity with cell density, which gradually declined at later stages. This activation was dependent upon cell-cell contact, since it was eliminated if cell adhesion was disrupted through calcium chelation, while it was reinstated through cell aggregation. Furthermore, this activation was suppressed following inhibition of JAKs (Janus kinases) but not inhibition of Fer, IGF1-R, or kinases of the c-Src family. On the other hand, constitutively active Stat3 in carcinoma lines, known to harbor activated Src, was blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of Src as well as JAKs. These results point to the existence of two distinct pathways of Stat3 activation in breast carcinomas, based on Src dependence. More importantly, our results suggest that Stat3 activity is upregulated during the confluence-mediated growth arrest by a signalling mechanism that requires JAKs.","Breast cancer; Breast carcinoma lines; Cell confluence; Cell-to-cell adhesion; Rodent fibroblasts; Stat3","ferritin; Janus kinase; receptor protein; somatomedin binding protein 1 receptor; STAT3 protein; tyrosine derivative; unclassified drug; article; breast cancer; cancer cell culture; carcinogenesis; cell adhesion; cell contact; cell culture; cell density; cell disruption; chelation; controlled study; gene activation; growth disorder; human; human cell; molecular mechanics; oncogene src; priority journal; protein function; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; upregulation; Animals; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Breast Neoplasms; Calcium; Cell Adhesion; Cell Division; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cells, Cultured; DNA-Binding Proteins; Down-Regulation; Enzyme Activation; Epidermal Growth Factor; Fibroblasts; Humans; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Janus Kinase 1; Luciferases; Mice; NIH 3T3 Cells; Phosphorylation; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Rats; Signal Transduction; src-Family Kinases; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Time Factors; Trans-Activators; Tyrosine; Up-Regulation; Janus; Rodentia",,"ferritin, 9007-73-2; Janus kinase, 161384-16-3; tyrosine derivative, 42406-77-9; Calcium, 7440-70-2; DNA-Binding Proteins; Epidermal Growth Factor, 62229-50-9; JAK1 protein, human, EC 2.7.1.112; Jak1 protein, mouse; Jak1 protein, rat, EC 2.7.1.112; Janus Kinase 1, EC 2.7.1.112; Luciferases, EC 1.13.12.-; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.112; src-Family Kinases, EC 2.7.1.112; STAT3 protein, human; Stat3 protein, mouse; Stat3 protein, rat; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Trans-Activators; Tyrosine, 55520-40-6",,,,"Balhoff, J.P., Stephens, J.M., (1998) Biochem.

K7L3N6, Canada","We previously developed a technique, termed in situ electroporation, where nonpermeant molecules are introduced through an electrical pulse into adherent cells, while they grow on electrically conductive, optically transparent, indium-tin oxide (ITO). Careful control of the electric field intensity results in essentially 100% of the cells taking up the introduced material, without any detectable effect upon the physiology of the cell, presumably because the pores reseal rapidly so that the cellular interior is restored to its original state. Electroporation of radioactive material is faced with two important considerations: (1) potential for exposure of personnel to irradiation, and (2) the requirement for electroporation of a large number of cells. In this report, we describe a modification in the geometry of the slides and electrodes which permits the use of inexpensive ITO-coated glass of lower conductivity that can be discarded after use, to electroporate large numbers of cells using a minimum volume of radioactive nucleotide solution. The results demonstrate that, using this assembly, the determination of the Ras-bound GTP/GTP+GDP ratios through electroporation of [α32P]GTP can be conducted using approximately five times lower amounts of isotope than in previous designs. Moreover, this assembly permits efficient upscaling, which makes the determination of Ras-GTP binding in cells which are deficient in Ras activity possible. In addition, we demonstrate the labeling of two viral phosphoproteins - the Simian Virus 40 Large Tumor antigen, and Adenovirus E1A - through [γ32P]ATP electroporation using this setup. In both cases, electroporation of the nucleotide can achieve a great increase in the efficiency and specificity of labeling compared to the addition of [32P]-orthophosphate to the culture medium, presumably because the immediate phosphate donor nucleotide itself is introduced, which can directly bind to the target proteins.",,"guanosine diphosphate; guanosine triphosphate; nucleotide; phosphorus 32; radioactive material; adherent cell; animal cell; article; controlled study; electric conductivity; electroporation; isotope labeling; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein function; radiation exposure; Adenovirus E1A Proteins; Animals; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Cell Line; Cell Membrane Permeability; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Electroporation; Fibroblasts; Guanosine Diphosphate; Guanosine Triphosphate; Mice; Oncogene Protein p21(ras); Phosphorus Radioisotopes; Viral Proteins; Adenoviridae; Animalia; Simiae; Simian virus 40",,"guanosine diphosphate, 146-91-8; guanosine triphosphate, 86-01-1; phosphorus 32, 14596-37-3; Adenovirus E1A Proteins; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases, EC 2.7.7.6; Guanosine Diphosphate, 146-91-8; Guanosine Triphosphate, 86-01-1; L protein, Simian parainfluenza virus 41, 148997-74-4; Oncogene Protein p21(ras), EC 3.6.5.2; Phosphorus Radioisotopes; Viral Proteins",,,,"Brake, A.J., Julius, D., Signalling by extracellular nucleotides (1996) Annu.

To determine the stage in tumor development at which GJIC is interrupted, we used the well-established model of lung tumors induced in strain A/J mice by urethane. In this system, tumor development follows a well-characterized pattern; hyperplasias, adenomas, and carcinomas are manifested at approximately 8, 16, and 40 weeks after urethane treatment, respectively. GJIC levels were examined using a novel technique where cells are grown on a glass slide, half of which is coated with electrically conductive, optically transparent, indium-tin oxide. An electric pulse that opens transient pores on the plasma membrane is applied in the presence of the fluorescent dye, Lucifer yellow, causing dye penetration into cells growing on the conductive part of the slide. Migration of the dye through gap junctions to nonelectroporated cells growing on the nonconductive area is then microscopically observed under fluorescence illumination. Unexpectedly, primary cells cultured from urethane-induced tumors, even late stage carcinomas, possessed extensive GJIC immediately upon isolation. Upon passage for several months however, these cells lost GJIC. These results suggest that the molecular changes that lead to the formation of the tumor in vivo are not sufficient to interrupt gap junctions. Propagation of tumor cells in culture induces additional alterations that can lead to gap junction closure.",,"fluorescent dye; indium; lucifer yellow; tin; urethan; isoquinoline derivative; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; cell communication; cell culture; cell growth; cell isolation; cell membrane; controlled study; electric conductivity; epithelium cell; gap junction; hyperplasia; illumination; lung adenoma; lung alveolus epithelium; lung carcinoma; lung tumor; microscopy; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; animal; cell junction; electroporation; metabolism; methodology; physiology; signal transduction; Animalia; Animals; Electroporation; Fluorescent Dyes; Gap Junctions; Isoquinolines; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Signal Transduction",,"indium, 7440-74-6; lucifer yellow, 67769-47-5, 82446-52-4; tin, 14314-35-3, 7440-31-5; urethan, 51-79-6; Fluorescent Dyes; Isoquinolines; lucifer yellow, 77944-88-8",,,,"Azarnia, R., Loewenstein, W.R., Polyomavirus middle t antigen downregulates junctional cell-to-cell communication (1987) Mol.

In this report we have identified a 75-kDa Raf-associated protein as Hsp90N, a novel member of the Hsp90 family. Intriguingly, the ansamycin-binding domain is replaced in Hsp90N by a much shorter, hydrophobic sequence, preceded by a putative myristylation signal. We demonstrate that, although much less abundant, Hsp90N binds Raf with a higher affinity than Hsp90. In sharp contrast to Hsp90, Hsp90N does not associate with p50cdc37, the Hsp90 kinase cofactor. Hsp90N was found to activate Raf in transiently transfected cells, while Rat Fill fibroblasts stably transfected with Hsp90N exhibited elevated activity of the Raf and downstream ERK kinases. This may be due to Raf binding to myristylated Hsp90N, followed by Raf translocation to the membrane. To examine whether Hsp90N could therefore substitute for Ras in Raf recruitment to the cell membrane, Hsp90N was transfected in c-Ras-deficient, 10T1/2-derived preadipocytes. Our results indicate that, as shown before for activated Ras or Raf, the introduction of even low levels of Hsp90N through transfection in c-Ras-deficient preadipocytes causes a dramatic block of differentiation. Higher levels of Hsp90N expression resulted in neoplastic transformation, including interruption of gap junctional, intercel. lular communication, and anchorage-independent proliferation. These results indicate that the observed activation of Raf by Hsp90N has a profound biological effect, which is largely c-Ras-independent. With the recent finding that p50cdc37 is tumorigenic in transgenic mice, these results reinforce the intriguing observation that the family of heat shock proteins represents a novel class of molecules with oncogenic potential.",,"Cell membranes; Cells; Drug products; Hydrophobicity; Living systems studies; Tumors; Signal transducers; Proteins; ansamycin derivative; antineoplastic agent; heat shock protein 90; heat shock protein 90n; mitogen activated protein kinase; phosphotransferase; protein p50; protein RAF1; Raf protein; Ras protein; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; binding affinity; carcinogenesis; cell communication; cell differentiation; cell membrane; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme activity; gap junction; genetic transfection; hydrophobicity; malignant transformation; nonhuman; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein analysis; protein binding; protein conformation; protein expression; protein family; protein function; sequence analysis; signal transduction; Adipocytes; Animals; Binding Sites; Carrier Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Division; Cell Line; Cell Membrane; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; COS Cells; Drosophila Proteins; Enzyme Activation; Fibroblasts; Gap Junctions; Glutathione Transferase; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Immunoblotting; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Molecular Chaperones; Myristic Acids; Phenotype; Plasmids; Precipitin Tests; Protein Binding; Protein Isoforms; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Rats; Signal Transduction; Transfection; Animalia; Mus musculus",,"Carrier Proteins; Cdc37 protein, rat; Cell Cycle Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; Glutathione Transferase, EC 2.5.1.18; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1, EC 2.7.1.37; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3, EC 2.7.1.37; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Molecular Chaperones; Myristic Acids; Protein Isoforms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras), EC 3.6.5.2",,,,"Avruch, J., Zhang, X., Kyriakis, J.M., (1994) Trends Biochem.

K7L 3N6, Canada","The in vivo labelling of viral or cellular components is usually conducted through the addition of radioactively labelled precursors to the culture medium. A limiting factor for isotope use is often the cost of isotope purchase and disposal. Therefore, significant savings can be achieved if the smallest possible volume of medium is employed. However, in the case of adherent cells growing in tissue culture dishes or multi-well plates, surface tension causes a very uneven distribution of the liquid due to the formation of a meniscus at the edge of the petri. This prevents the use of very small volumes of medium for cell growth and labelling because the cells at the center of the petri dish would dry out and die, especially after longer incubation periods. In this communication, we describe a technique whereby cells are grown in an area surrounded by a hydrophobic ring of Teflon, which greatly improves the distribution of the medium by eliminating the concave meniscus. This translates into a dramatic improvement in the condition of the cells, as well as the efficiency of labelling of phosphoproteins, such as the Simian Virus 40 large tumor antigen with 32P-orthophosphate or labelling of the cellular DNA with 3[H]thymidine. The technique is useful for any application where growth of cells in small volumes of medium is required. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although inactivation of the p53 and pRb tumor suppressors has been causally linked to the transforming properties of SVLT, its exact mechanism of action remains undefined. Previous data indicated that Ras is activated in SVLT-expressing cells. In this report we show that SVLT also increases Raf kinase activity in both insect and mammalian cells, thus identifying the Raf kinase as an additional target of SVLT. Our results further show that SVLT was still able to activate Raf in cells where Ras levels had been drastically reduced through expression of an antisense construct, indicating that SVLT may activate Raf at least partly by a mechanism that is independent of its stimulatory effect on Ras.",,"Cells; Tumors; Viruses; Oncogene; Antigens; antisense oligonucleotide; protein p53; Raf protein; Ras protein; retinoblastoma protein; virus large T antigen; virus T antigen; animal cell; article; cell transformation; controlled study; enzyme activity; gene targeting; insect cell; mammal cell; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; Simian virus 40; tumor suppressor gene; animal; cell line; down regulation; enzyme activation; enzyme active site; fibroblast; genetic transfection; genetics; human; insect; metabolism; mouse; oncogene ras; phenotype; phosphorylation; physiology; protein binding; protein tertiary structure; serodiagnosis; signal transduction; Animalia; DNA viruses; Insecta; Mammalia; Simiae; Simian virus 40; Simian virus; Animals; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Catalytic Domain; Cell Line; Down-Regulation; Enzyme Activation; Fibroblasts; Genes, ras; Humans; Insects; Mice; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Precipitin Tests; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf; ras Proteins; Signal Transduction; Transfection",,"Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf, EC 2.7.1.37; ras Proteins, EC 3.6.5.2",,,,"Bocchetta, M., Di, R., Powers, A., Fresco, R., Tosolini, A., Testa, J.R., Pass, H.I., Carbone, M., (2000) Proc.

K7L 3N6, Canada","Activation of the Ras pathway is central to mitogenesis by a variety of growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or hepatocyte growth factor. Ras activation requires the function of adaptors such as growth factor receptor-binding protein 2, which can bind either directly or indirectly through Src homology 2 domains to the activated receptor. To examine the role of the Src homology 2 domain of growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 in the mitogenic response triggered by these growth factors, we introduced a peptide (PVPE-phosphono-methylphenylalanine- INQS) that can selectively bind this domain into mouse, rat, or human cells growing on conductive indium-tin oxide-coated glass by in situ electroporation. Cells were subsequently stimulated with growth factors and assessed for activation of a downstream target, extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, by probing with antibodies specific for its activated form. Electrodes and slides were configured to provide nonelectroporated control cells side by side with the electroporated ones, both growing on the same type of indium-tin oxide-coated glass surface. The data demonstrate that the peptide can cause a dramatic inhibition of epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor-mediated ERK1/2 activation and DNA synthesis in vivo, compared with its control phenylalanine-containing counterpart. In contrast, the peptide had a very limited effect on hepatocyte growth factor-triggered ERK1/2 activation and DNA synthesis. These results demonstrate the potential of the in situ electroporation approach described here in the study of the coupling of activated receptor tyrosine kinases to the ERK1/2 cascade.",,"binding protein; epidermal growth factor; growth factor; growth factor receptor; indium; mitogen activated protein kinase; phenylalanine derivative; platelet derived growth factor; Ras protein; scatter factor; tyrosine kinase receptor; animal cell; article; controlled study; DNA synthesis; electroporation; enzyme inhibition; human; human cell; mitogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; sequence homology; tumor cell line; 3T3 Cells; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cell Division; Cells, Cultured; Electroporation; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Inhibitors; Flavonoids; GRB2 Adaptor Protein; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Mice; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Peptides; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Rats; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; src Homology Domains; Time Factors",,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Enzyme Inhibitors; Flavonoids; GRB2 Adaptor Protein; GRB2 protein, human; Grb2 protein, mouse; Grb2 protein, rat; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1, EC 2.7.1.37; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3, EC 2.7.1.37; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; PD 98059; Peptides; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met, EC 2.7.1.112; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor, EC 2.7.1.112; Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor, EC 2.7.1.112",,,,"Weiss, A., Schlessinger, J., Switching signals on or off by receptor dimerization (1998) Cell, 94, pp. 277-280; Porter, A.C., Vaillancourt, R.R., Tyrosine kinase receptor-activated signal transduction pathways which lead to oncogenesis (1998) Oncogene, 17, pp. 1343-1352; Kizaka-Kortdoh, S., Matsuda, M., Okayama, H., CrkII signals from epidermal growth factor receptor to Ras (1996) Proc.

The mT-transformed cells up-regulated PKC δ and down-regulated both PKC ε and PKC λ expression, and were more sensitive to the drug than their non-transformed counterparts. The drug treatment further lowered the expression of PKC ε, triggered nuclear translocation of PKC δ and its site-specific proteolysis, consistent with the notion that changes in specific PKC isoforms play a role not only in the neoplastic transformation of fibroblasts, but also in their apoptotic response.

We showed previously that the addition of exogenous hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the presence of fibronectin fibrils stimulate anchorage-independent colony growth of a murine mammary carcinoma, SP1, which expresses both HGF and HGF receptor (Met; R. Saulnier et al., Exp. Cell Res., 222: 360-369, 1996). We now show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Met in carcinoma cells is augmented by cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin substratum. In contrast, detached serum-starved cells exhibit reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Met and undergo apoptotic cell death within 18-24 h. Under these conditions, the addition of HGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Met and restores survival of carcinoma cells. Soluble fibronectin also stimulates cell survival and shows a cooperative survival response with HGF but does not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Met; these results indicate that fibronectin acts via a pathway independent of Met in detached cells. We demonstrated previously that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity blocks HGF- induced DNA synthesis of carcinoma cells (N. Rahimi et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271: 24850-24855, 1996). We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473. PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony growth. However, c-Src kinase or MEK1/2 activities are not required for the cell survival effect. Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin- induced survival response of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an interaction between integrin and HGF/Met signalling pathways in the development of invasive breast cancer.",,"fibronectin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; scatter factor; scatter factor receptor; serine; animal cell; article; breast carcinoma; carcinoma cell; cell adhesion; cell survival; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; molecular dynamics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Animals; Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating; Cell Adhesion; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Chromones; Culture Media, Serum-Free; Enzyme Inhibitors; Epithelial Cells; Female; Fibronectins; Hepatocyte Growth Factor; Mammary Glands, Animal; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Mice; Morpholines; Neoplasm Proteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Animalia; Murinae",,"1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, EC 2.7.1.137; 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 154447-36-6; Chromones; Culture Media, Serum-Free; Enzyme Inhibitors; Fibronectins; Hepatocyte Growth Factor, 67256-21-7; Morpholines; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.112; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met, EC 2.7.1.112; Proto-Oncogene Proteins",,,,"Boudreau, N., Werb, Z., Bissell, M.J., Suppression of apoptosis by basement membrane requires three-dimensional tissue organization and withdrawal from the cell cycle (1996) Proc.

The response to exogenous ALA under standard conditions (the ALA phenotype) is characteristic for each cell type. Significantly more Pp]X accumulates in malignant and premalignant cells than in the normal cells from which they were derived. A rodent fibroblast model was developed to study the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Exogenous ALA induced the accumulation of substantial concentrations of PpIX in fibrosarcoma cells, and in immortalized fibroblasts transfected with the oncogene c-myc, IGF-1 receptor, IGF-1 and its receptor, v-fos, v-raf, v-Ki-ras, v-abl or polyomavirus middle T antigen with G418 resistance selection. Much lower concentrations of PpIX accumulated in primary fibroblast cultures, in immortalized fibroblast cell lines, and in immortalized fibroblasts transfected with the G418-resistance gene only. The mechanisms responsible for the increased accumulation of ALA-induced PpIX by transformed cells (the malignant ALA phenotype) therefore appear to be closely linked to the mechanisms responsible for malignant transformation. identification of the nature of that linkage may lead to new approaches to cancer therapy.","Aminolevulinic acid; Fibroblasts; Malignant transformation; Oncogenes; Photodynamic therapy; Protoporphyrin","aminolevulinic acid; protoporphyrin; somatomedin binding protein 1; somatomedin c; somatomedin c receptor; animal cell; article; cancer cell; cell transformation; female; fetus; fibroblast; fibroblast culture; human; human cell; model; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene c myc; priority journal; 3T3 Cells; Aminolevulinic Acid; Animals; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cell Transformation, Viral; Female; Fibroblasts; Fibrosarcoma; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Oncogenes; Phenotype; Photosensitizing Agents; Protoporphyrins; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Signal Transduction; Species Specificity; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Transfection; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",,"Aminolevulinic Acid, 106-60-5; Fluorescent Dyes; Photosensitizing Agents; protoporphyrin IX, 553-12-8; Protoporphyrins",,"Fluka, Switzerland",,"Baserga, R., Reiss, K., Alder, H., Pietrzkowski, Z., Surmacz, E., Inhibition of cell cycle progression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (1992) Ann NY Acad Sci, 660, pp. 64-69; Campbell, D.L., Fisher, M.E., Johnson, J.G., Rossi, F.M., Campling, B.G., Pottier, R.H., Kennedy, J.C., Flow cytometric technique for quantitating cytotoxic response to photodynamic therapy (1996) Photochem Photobiol, 63, pp. 111-116; Campbell, D.L., Gudgin-Dickson, E.F., Forkert, P.G., Pottier, R.H., Kennedy, J.C., Detection of early stages of carcinogenesis in adenomas of murine lung by 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX fluorescence (1996) Photochem Photobiol, 64, pp. 676-682; Golub, A.L., Gudgin-Dickson, E.F., Kennedy, J.C., Marcus, S.L., Park, Y., Pottier, R.H., The monitoring of ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX accumulation and clearance in patients with skin lesions by in vivo surface-detected fluorescence spectroscopy (1998) Lasers Med Sci, , in press; Kennedy, J.C., Pottier, R.H., Endogenous protoporphyrin IX, a clinically useful photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (1992) J Photochem Photobiol B: Biol, 14, pp. 275-292; Kennedy, J.C., Pottier, R.H., Pross, D.C., Photodynamic therapy with endogenous protoporphyrin IX: Basic principles and present clinical experience (1990) J Photochem Photobiol B: Biol, 6, pp. 143-148; Kennedy, J.C., Marcus, S.L., Pottier, R.H., Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photodiagnosis (PD) using endogenous photosensitization induced by 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA): Mechanisms and clinical results (1996) J Clin Laser Med Surg, 14, pp. 289-304; Kiss, Z., Rapp, U.R., Pettit, G.R., Anderson, W.B., Phorbol ester and bryostatin differentially regulate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine in Ha-ras-and raf-oncogene-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (1991) Biochem J, 276 (PT 2), pp. 505-509; Land, H., Parada, L.F., Weinberg, R.A., Tumorigenic conversion of primary embryo fibroblasts requires at least two cooperating oncogenes (1983) Nature, 304, pp. 596-602; Loo, D., Cotman, C.W., Primary and extended culture of embryonic mouse cells (1998) Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual, pp. 65-72. , Celis JE (ed), Academic Press: London; Peng, Q., Berg, K., Moan, J., Kongshaug, M., Nesland, J.M., 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy: Principles and experimental research (1997) Photochem Photobiol, 65, pp. 235-251; Peng, Q., Warloe, T., Berg, K., Moan, J., Kongshaug, M., Giereksky, K.E., Nesland, J.M., 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy: Clinical research and future challenges (1997) Cancer, 79, pp. 2282-2308; Raptis, L., Lafrom, H., Benjamin, T.L., Regulation of cellular phenotype and expression of polyomavirus middle T antigen in rat fibroblasts (1985) Mol Cell Biol, 5, pp. 2476-2486; Roy, B.N., Van Vugt, D.A., Weagle, G.E., Pottier, R.H., Reid, R.L., Effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid dose and estrogen on protoporphyrin IX concentrations in the rat uterus (1997) J Soc Gynecol Invest, 4, pp. 40-46; Yamashita, T., Kato, H., Fujinaga, K., Conditional immortalization and/or transformation of rat cells carrying v-abl or EJras oncogene in the presence or absence of glucocorticoid hormone (1988) Int J Cancer, 42, pp. 930-938; Yang, J.C., Glastein, E.J., Rosenberg, S.A., Antman, K.H., Sarcoma of soft tissues (1993) Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology, pp. 1436-1488. , DeVila VT Jr, Hellman S and Rosenberg SA (ed), JB Lippincott: Philadelphia","Li, G.; Regional Cancer Centre, 25 King Street W., Kingston, Ont.

To examine GJIC levels in human lung carcinoma cells, a novel technique was developed: cells were grown on a glass slide, half of which was coated with electrically conductive, optically transparent, indium-tin oxide. An electric pulse which opens transient pores on the plasma membrane was applied in the presence of the fluorescent dye, Lucifer yellow, causing the dye's penetration into the cells growing on the conductive part of the slide. The migration of the dye through gap junctions to the non-electroporated cells growing on the non-conductive area was then observed microscopically under fluorescence illumination. The results show that this is a rapid, precise and highly reproducible assay for GJIC assessment in lines established from lung carcinomas or freshly explanted lung tumor cells. Out of 17 established lines only two had extensive junctional communication, while out of 16 fresh tumor specimens none displayed GJIC. On the other hand, fibroblasts isolated from the same tumors had extensive junctional permeability. The examination of GJIC in a large number of samples could establish a correlation between GJIC and metastasis which might have prognostic value.

The results demonstrate that ras(leu61) expression in this line blocks differentiation and that this block appears at lower levels than required for full neoplastic transformation. In addition, to examine whether the inability of Ras(leu61) to induce differentiation by replacing the insulin signal could be attributed to its transforming effect in this system, we examined the effect of Ras(leu61) at levels below the baseline, by expressing ras(leu61) in a series of preadipocytes which were rendered deficient in endogenous c-Ras activity. The results show that even very low Ras(leu61) levels, insufficient to restore the growth rate of these cells to normal, blocked rather than enhanced differentiation, indicating that ras(leu61) expression alone is not sufficient to promote adipocytic differentiation in this system, even in the absence of neoplastic transformation. Consistent with its established role as a downstream effector of Ras, v-Raf expression mirrored the v-Ras effects upon adipocytic differentiation and transformation.",,"insulin; mitogen activated protein kinase; raf protein; ras protein; adipocyte; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell transformation; embryo; enzyme activation; gene expression; growth rate; malignant transformation; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene ras; priority journal; proadipocyte; signal transduction; Adipocytes; Animals; Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Enzyme Activation; Genes, ras; Kinetics; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Oncogene Protein p21(ras); Oncogene Proteins v-raf; Oncogenes; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recombinant Proteins; Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic; Transfection; Animalia",,"Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase, EC 2.7.1.123; Oncogene Protein p21(ras), EC 3.6.5.2; Oncogene Proteins v-raf, EC 2.7.1.37; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.112; Recombinant Proteins; Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic",,,,"Filipak, M., Estervig, D.N., Tzen, C.Y., Minoo, P., Hoerl, B.J., Maerklein, P.B., Zschunke, M.A., Scott, R.E., (1989) Environ.

To investigate the role of the Ras oncogene product in gap junction closure and to incorporate GJ1C into the gamut of transformation-related properties which can be regulated by increasing levels of oncogene expression, a panel of murine C3H10T 1/4 and 3T3L1 fibroblasts was constructed in which graded increments of Ras(leu61) could reliably be obtained. The inducibly activated Ras(leu61) protein substantially reduced or eliminated GJIC at levels much lower than those needed for neoplastic transformation, as indicated by acquisition of the ability to proliferate in the absence of anchorage. These results indicate that disruption of GJIC, although necessary, is not sufficient for neoplastic transformation in this system.","Anchorage-independent proliferation; Intercellular junctional communication; Neoplastic transformation; Ras oncogene","protein p21; animal; article; cell communication; cell culture; cell division; cell junction; cell strain 3T3; cell transformation; metabolism; mouse; physiology; signal transduction; 3T3 Cells; Animals; Cell Communication; Cell Division; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cells, Cultured; Gap Junctions; Intercellular Junctions; Mice; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Signal Transduction",,"Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras), EC 3.6.5.2",,,,,"Brownell, H.L.; Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont.

Consistent with previous results, SVLT- induced morphological transformation was unaffected by the down-regulation of c-ras gene product activity. On the other hand, colony formation in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice were drastically reduced in c-Ras-deficient cells. In addition, SVLT expression in C3H10T 1/4 cells led to increased c-Ras activity, as determined by an increase in the Ras-bound GTP/GTP + GDP ratio.

The results demonstrate a quantitative reciprocal regulation of differentiation and several transformation- associated properties in response to graded levels of ras gene expression, with the loss of differentiative capacity, morphological transformation, stimulation of proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth requiring increasing levels of Res(leu61) protein. Furthermore, using novel, tightly regulatable 3T3 L1 transfectants, we demonstrated that Ras(leu61) effectiveness in blocking adipocytic differentiation is strictly dependent on the timing of its expression relative to cell growth arrest, with ras(leu61) expression being ineffective at inhibiting differentiation or inducing morphological transformation once the differentiative process has commenced. Moreover, ras(leu61) induction failed to substitute for or enhance the c- Ras-dependent differentiative insulin signal, even under conditions in which it did not induce transformation. Therefore, although necessary for insulin signal transduction, the Ras signal alone is not sufficient to induce adipocytic differentiation in this system. Consistent with its established role as a downstream effector of Ras, v-Raf expression mirrored the Ras(leu61) effects on adipocytic differentiation and transformation.",,"ras protein; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell strain 3t3; cell transformation; controlled study; gene expression; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene ras; priority journal; proadipocyte; signal transduction; 3T3 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Division; Cell Line, Transformed; Gene Expression; Genes, ras; Mice; Oncogene Proteins v-raf; ras Proteins; Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic; Time Factors",,"Oncogene Proteins v-raf, EC 2.7.1.37; ras Proteins, EC 3.6.5.2; Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic",,,,"Filipak, M., Estervig, D.N., Tzen, C.Y., Minoo, P., Hoerl, B.J., Maerklein, P.B., Zschunke, M.A., Scott, R.E., Integrated control of proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (1989) Environ.

To identity the initial steps of the mT-induced signaling pathway(s) leading to this inhibition, T51B cells were transfected with vectors encoding the NG59, dI23, and 248M mT mutants, which are known to interact in a differential manner with c-Src, PI3-kinase, and Shc. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Northern blot analysis showed a loss of cytokeratins in dI23 or 248M but not in NG59 mT mutant-containing cells. An in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that only the dI23 and 248M mT mutants could associate with c-Src. This c-Src-mediated action of mT on CK14 gene expression was further confirmed by adding the v-src gene product in T51B cells. The assessment of the transforming capacity of the mT mutants demonstrated that the NG59 and dI23 mT mutants were nontransformant, whereas the 248M mT mutant expressed an appreciable transforming activity. These results show that the down-regulation of CK14 gene expression by mT in the LEC line T51B is dependent on the association with the c-Src tyrosine kinase, but interestingly, this c-Src-mediated action of mT can occur in the absence of transformation. Furthermore, when coupled with recent data on the plasticity of LECs, the present findings provide the first essential element in our definition of the signaling pathway(s) that link growth/differentiation events with CK gene regulation in typical simple epithelial cells.",,"cytokeratin; gene product; virus middle t antigen; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell transformation; epithelium cell; gene expression regulation; liver cell; nonhuman; oncogene src; polyoma virus; priority journal; rat; Animals; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Cell Line; Cell Transformation, Viral; Down-Regulation; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Genes, src; Genetic Vectors; Keratins; Liver; Mutation; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Transfection; Animalia; Polyomavirus",,"Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Keratins, 68238-35-7",,,,"Moll, R., Franke, W.W., Schiller, D.L., Geiger, B., Krepler, R., The catalog of human cytokeratins: Patterns of expression in normal epithelia, tumors and cultured cells (1982) Cell, 31, pp. 11-24; Quinlan, R.A., Schiller, D.L., Hatzfeld, M., Achtstätter, T., Moll, R., Jorcano, J.L., Franke, W.W., Patterns of expression and organization of cytokeratin intermediate filaments (1985) Ann.

K7L3N6, Canada","A decrease in gap junctional, intercellular communication (GJIC) has been associated with cells neoplastically transformed by a variety of factors. To investigate the role of the Ras oncogene product in gap junction function, a panel of murine C3H10T 1/4 (10T 1/4 ) fibroblasts was constructed in which the levels of ras gene expression could be effectively up- or down- regulated. Intercellular communication was measured using a novel technique of in situ electroporation of adherent cells on a partly conductive slide. The introduction of increasing amounts of activated Ras(leu61) in mouse 10T 1/4 fibroblasts proportionally reduced GJIC, while the downregulation of endogenous c-ras gene expression increased junctional permeability. These results indicate that Ras plays an important role in the junction closure pathway leading to the proliferation of normal cells. However, differentiation of c-Ras-deficient preadipocytes entirely abolished their initially extensive GJIC, indicating that junction closure in response to adipocytic differentiation is independent of Ras.",,"adipocyte; animal cell; article; cell communication; cell differentiation; cell junction; cell proliferation; down regulation; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; growth regulation; malignant transformation; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene ras; priority journal; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation; Cell Division; Cell Line; Electroporation; Fibroblasts; Gap Junctions; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, ras; Humans; Mice; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); RNA, Antisense",,"HRAS protein, human, EC 3.6.5.2; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras), EC 3.6.5.2; RNA, Antisense",,,,"Anderson, S.K., Stankova, J., Roder, J.C., Decreased p21 levels in anti-sense ras transfectants augments NK sensitivity (1989) Mol.

K7L3N6, Canada","One of the effects of neoplastic transformation by a variety of factors is a decrease in gap junctional, intercellular communication (GJIC). The investigation of junctional permeability is usually conducted through the microinjection of the fluorescent dye, Lucifer yellow, followed by observation of its migration into neighboring cells. This is a time-consuming approach, requiring expensive equipment. To overcome these problems, a novel technique was devised which takes advantage of the ability of short electric pulses to create transient 'pores' on the cell membrane through which Lucifer yellow can enter, simultaneously and into large numbers of cells, with minimal disturbance to cellular metabolism. Cells were grown on a glass slide, half of which was coated with electrically conductive, optically transparent, indium-tin oxide. An electric pulse was applied in the presence of Lucifer yellow, causing its penetration into the cells growing on the conductive half of the slide, and the migration of the dye to the nonelectroporated cells growing on the nonconductive area was microscopically observed under fluorescence illumination. Using this technique, we investigated the relationship between expression of the middle tumor antigen of polyoma virus (mT) and GJIC in two representative cell systems with different responses to mT. The results show that low mT expression levels, although unable to transform rat F111 cells fully, are able to interrupt GJIC. Although parts of this mechanism might be mediated through protein kinase C (PKC), mT appears to have additional functions. PKC, however, had the opposite effect upon junctional permeability in a clone of mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts; intercellular communication in these cells appears to require PKC activity.",,"lucifer yellow; protein kinase c; animal cell; antigen expression; article; cell adhesion; cell communication; cell junction; cell membrane permeability; channel gating; controlled study; enzyme activity; malignant transformation; mouse; nonhuman; polyoma virus; priority journal; rat; 3T3 Cells; Animal; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Cell Communication; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Survival; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Electroporation; Fibroblasts; Fluorescent Dyes; Gap Junctions; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Indium; Isoquinolines; Mice; Protein Kinase C; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tin Compounds",,"lucifer yellow, 67769-47-5, 82446-52-4; protein kinase C, 141436-78-4; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Fluorescent Dyes; Indium, 7440-74-6; Isoquinolines; lucifer yellow, 77944-88-8; Protein Kinase C, EC 2.7.1.37; stannic oxide, 18282-10-5; Tin Compounds",,,,,"Raptis, L.H.; Microbiology/Immunology Department, Botterell Hall, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont.

Contrary to F111, a clone of mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts has a high membrane-associated PKC activity and is as tumorigenic as polyoma-transformed cells, although this clone is still anchorage-dependent. Therefore, membrane-associated PKC activation might be one of the signals leading to tumorigenicity but not necessarily anchorage-independence. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.",,"protein kinase c; tumor antigen; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; carcinogenicity; cell transplantation; controlled study; fibroblast; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; 3T3 Cells; Animal; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Transformed; Clone Cells; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Neoplasms, Experimental; Protein Kinase C; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"protein kinase C, 141436-78-4; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Membrane Proteins; Protein Kinase C, EC 2.7.1.37",,,,,"Raptis, L.; Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont.

This work is a comparison between two methods of accomplishing this delivery; liposome-mediated delivery and electroporation. The final goal was to examine the effects of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) inhibitor Basilen Blue (BB) on glyceryl trinitrate biotransformation in porcine kidney epithelial (PK1) cells after intracellular delivery. Initial evaluation used the fluorescent markers carboxyfluorescein and lucifer yellow (LY). This was followed by biochemical analysis of glyceryl trinitrate biotransformation. Liposome-mediated delivery proved ineffective in spite of variations in the lipid composition of the liposomes and the use of an agglutinin and a fusogen. In contrast, electroporation was a very effective method for intracellular delivery of both lucifer yellow and basilen blue to the PK1 cells. The results show that in cells where Basilen Blue was introduced, there was a decrease in both the glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) biotransformation and ratio of glyceryl-1,2-dinitrate (1,2-GDN) to glyceryl-1,3-dinitrate (1,3-GDN) formed. The technique of in situ electroporation shows great promise for the assessment of a variety of nonpermeant molecules of pharmacological interest. © 1993.","Cell culture; Electroporation; Glyceryl trinitrate biotransformation; Intracellular delivery; Liposomes","basilen blue; basilen blue e 3g; carboxyfluorescein; enzyme inhibitor; fluorescent dye; glutathione transferase inhibitor; glyceryl trinitrate; liposome; lucifer yellow; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; cell culture; controlled study; drug metabolism; electroporation; fluorescence; kidney epithelium; membrane fusion; membrane transport; nonhuman; priority journal; swine; technique; transmission electron microscopy; Animal; Biotransformation; Cells, Cultured; Comparative Study; Drug Administration Routes; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Electric Stimulation; Electrodes; Epithelial Cells; Glutathione Transferase; Kidney; Liposomes; Nitroglycerin; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Swine; Triazines",,"carboxyfluorescein, 72088-94-9; glyceryl trinitrate, 55-63-0; lucifer yellow, 67769-47-5, 82446-52-4; Cibacron Blue F 3GA, 12236-82-7; Drug Carriers; Glutathione Transferase, EC 2.5.1.18; Liposomes; Nitroglycerin, 55-63-0; Triazines","basilen blue e 3g, basf, Canada; tridil, du pont, United States","basf, Canada; du pont, United States; molecular probes, United States; sigma, United States",,"Bennett, Leitman, Schröder, Kawamoto, Nakatsu, Murad, Relationship between biotransformation of glyceryl trinitrate and cyclic GMP accumulation in various cultured cell lines (1989) J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 250, pp. 316-323; Brien, McLaughlin, Breedon, Bennett, Nakatsu, Marks, Biotransformation of glyceryl trinitrate occurs concurrently with relaxation of rabbit aorta (1986) J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 237, pp. 608-614; Chakrabarti, Pfeiffer, Wylie, Schuster, Incorporation of monoclonal antibodies into cells by osmotic permeabilization (1989) J Biol Chem, 264, pp. 8214-8221; Graesmann, Wolf, Bornkamm, Expression of Epstein-Barr virus genes in different cell types after microinjection of viral DNA (1980) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 77, pp. 433-436; Krause, Juliano, Interactions of liposome-incorporated amphotericin B with kidney epithelial cell cultures (1988) Mol Pharmacol, 34, pp. 286-297; Lelkes, Friedman, Interaction of French-pressed liposomes with isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells; charactezation of the cell-liposome interactions (1985) J Biol Chem, 260 (3), pp. 1796-1803; McDonald, Bennett, Cytochrome P-450 mediated biotransformation of organic nitrates (1990) Can J Physiol Pharmacol, 68, pp. 1552-1557; Ozawa, Hosoi, Tsao, Urabe, Uchida, Takaku, Microinjection of macromolecules into leukemic cells by cell fusion technique: Search for intracellular growth-suppressive factors (1985) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 130, pp. 257-263; Raptis, Firth, Electroporation of adherent cells in situ (1990) DNA Cell Biol, 9 (8), pp. 615-621; Schröder, Leitman, Bennett, Waldman, Murad, Glyceryl trinitrate induced desensitization of guanylate cyclase in cultured rat lung fibroblasts (1988) J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 245 (2), pp. 413-418; Schröder, Leitman, Hayward, Bennett, Murad, Cultured rat lung fibroblasts as a model for organic nitrate-induced cyclic GMP accumulation and activation of guanylate cyclase (1987) J Appl Cardiol, 2 (4), pp. 301-311; Simon, Liposome delivery of a glutathione S-transferase inhibitor to cultured cells (1991) M.Sc.

We investigated this possibility utilizing as a model system the differentiation of the mesenchymal cell line C3H 10T1/2 (10T1/2) to adipocytes, and a series of transfectants of 10T1/2 cells in which the level of the ras gene product (p21ras; Ras) can be effectively up- or down-modulated. In agreement with previous reports, we found that 10T1/2 cultures, propagated in the resting state for several weeks, spontaneously convert to fat cells at a very low frequency. Downmodulation of endogenous p21ras levels, as a consequence of expression of antisense ras, markedly increased the rapidity and frequency of adipose conversion (6- to 10-fold), which was equivalent in magnitude to that effected by the potent differentiating agent 5-azacytidine. Conversely, overexpression of ras completely inhibited cell differentiation. In addition, adipocytes derived from antisense-ras expressing lines were characterized by a decrease in hormone responsiveness, as well as an apparent deficiency in attaining the terminally differentiated state. These findings suggest that Ras may be a negative regulator of the decision-making step of fibroblast differentiation to adipocytes. In addition, Ras may play an essential positive role in the transduction of hormonal signals necessary for full adipocyte maturation during later progression along the differentiation pathway.",,"dexamethasone; hybrid protein; insulin; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; protein p21; Proto Oncogene Protein p21(ras); adipose tissue; animal; article; cell differentiation; cell line; cytology; drug effect; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mouse; mouse strain; physiology; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Dexamethasone; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation; Insulin; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Proto-Oncogene Protein p21(ras); Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate",,"dexamethasone, 50-02-2; insulin, 9004-10-8; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate, 16561-29-8; protein p21, 85306-28-1; Dexamethasone, 50-02-2; Insulin, 11061-68-0; Proto-Oncogene Protein p21(ras), EC 3.6.1.-; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate, 16561-29-8",,,,,"Lu, Y.",,,,,,,,08298211,,,1297345,"English","Biochem Cell Biol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026934793

Cells infected with transformation-competent polyoma virus exhibit increased levels of inositol phospholipids and the second messenger inositol trisphosphate. MTAg or pp60(c-src) immunoprecipitates from MTAg-transformed cells contain an activity that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. This activity is induced in parallel with MTAg when the MTAg synthesis is regulated by hormonal or heavy metal inducers. Immunoprecipitates from one class of polyoma mutants defective in transformation have a reduced level of associated phosphatidylinositol kinase activity in vitro yet are capable of tyrosine phosphorylation on exogenous protein substrates at rates comparable to wild-type virus. Thus, for these mutants, phosphatidylinositol kinase activity is more tightly correlated with transformation than is protein kinase activity. These results suggest that alterations in phsophatidylinositol metabolism by MTAg play a role in transformation by polyoma virus.",,"phosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylinositol kinase; protein tyrosine kinase; cell culture; cell transformation; in vitro study; nonhuman; polyoma virus; priority journal; rat; Animals; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Cell Transformation, Viral; Mice; Mutation; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphorylation; Polyomavirus; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src); Rats; Polyomavirus",,"phosphatidylinositol kinase, 37205-54-2; protein tyrosine kinase, 80449-02-1; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Phosphatidylinositols; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, 2.7.1.112; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src), 2.7.1.112",,,,,,,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,2424008,"English","PROC.

Graded phenotypic responses to levels of mT induction by the hormone were seen, with morphological transformation, focus formation, and anchorage-independent growth requiring increasing levels of mT expression. The ability of different clones to form tumors reflected their maximum level of induction of mT-associated kinase and their ability to grow in soft agar. Expression of transformation parameters and tumorigenicity correlates with the level of mT phosphorylated by pp60(c-src) in immune complexes and not with the total amount of mT determined by metabolic labeling. We suggest that cellular factors regulate mT activity by forming a kinase-active fraction of mT molecules that controls the transformed state.",,"radioisotope; virus t antigen; breast; cell culture; dna transfection; extension gene; gene expression; genetic engineering; heredity; in vitro study; mouse mammary tumor oncovirus; nonhuman; plasmid; polyoma virus; rat; restriction fragment; virus cell transformation; Animal; Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line; Cell Transformation, Viral; Dexamethasone; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Synthetic; Male; Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse; Neoplasm Transplantation; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Phenotype; Polyomavirus; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Protein pp60(c-src); Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,"Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming; Antigens, Viral, Tumor; Dexamethasone, 50-02-2; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Protein pp60(c-src), EC 2.7.1.112; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Recombinant Proteins",,,,,,,,,,,,,02707306,,MCEBD,2426583,"English","MOL.
