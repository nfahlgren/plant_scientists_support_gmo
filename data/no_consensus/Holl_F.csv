Both T. semipilosum and T. repens were infected via root hairs, formed indeterminate nodules and commenced active nitrogen-fixation approximately 1 week after inoculation. Effective Rhizobium strains produced on average four nitrogen-fixing nodules per T. semipilosum plant, predominantly in the upper region of the tap root. In contrast, 65% of the average 15 nodules per T. repens plant were induced on lateral roots. The Rhizobium strain-ANU843, effective (Nod+Fix+) on T. repens, caused root hair branching and twisting on T. sempilosum, although plants did not fix nitrogen, indicative of an ineffective host-strain interaction. Such ineffective interactions were associated with increased total numbers of nodule-like structures on T. semipilosum; these nodules were atypically associated with, or in close proximity to, lateral roots. Using a GUS gene-modified rhizobia to monitor nodule occupancy, a third of the total nodule-like structures formed from the incompatible interactions showed a positive GUS reaction, indicating that colonization by Rhizobium strains of some of the nodule-like structures had occurred. Moreover, about 70% of the GUS positive nodule-like structures from the incompatible interactions were localized at the junction between the tap and lateral roots. These observations are consistent with an atypical infection route by the incompatible strains.",,"nodulation; perennial plant; symbiont; Rhizobium; Trifolium; Trifolium repens; Trifolium semipilosum",,,,,,"Bergensen, F.J., (1982) Root Nodules of Legumes: Structure and Functions, , Chichester: John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Research Studies Press; Caetano-Anollés, G., Crist-Estes, D.K., Baner, W.D., Chemotaxis of Rhizobium meliloti to the plant flavone luteolin requires functional nod genes (1988) Journal of Bacteriology, 170, pp. 3164-3169; Dart, P., Infection and development of leguminous nodules (1977) A treatise on Dinitrogen Fixation, pp. 367-472. , Eds R.

Six antibioticresistant bacterial strains belonging to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas were used as inocula. For controlled environment assays, surface sterilized seeds were inoculated with log 6 Bacillus or log 8 Pseudomonas colony-forming units (cfu) under gnotobiotic conditions for assessment of rhizosphere and internal root and stem tissue colonization. In the field trial, one-year-old, container-grown hybrid spruce seedlings were inoculated with each of the Bacillus or Pseudomonas strains 1-2 days before planting at nine field sites in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. All six strains colonized the rhizosphere with log 5.6-7.6 cfu g-1 root tissue under controlled environmental conditions. Two strains, Bacillus Pw-2R and Pseudomonas Sm3-RN, were also recovered from internal root and stem tissues with population sizes ranging from log 3.9 to log 5.0 cfu g-1 plant tissue. In the field trial, PGPR survived the winter in the rhizosphere with populations of log 2 to log 5 cfu g-1 root tissue 17 months after inoculation. In addition, spruce growth was significantly enhanced by bacterial inoculation at certain sites. The most effective growth-promoting strains were the endophytes, Sm3-RN and Pw2-R, and the external root colonizing strain, Ss2-RN. These three strains increased seedling dry weight up to 57% above noninoculated controls at five of the nine outplanting sites. Pseudomonas strain Sw1 and the other two Bacillus strains produced mean spruce dry weight increases at four of the sites. Seedling growth inhibition due to bacterial inoculation was detected at some sites. Our results confirm the short-term, site specific effectiveness of PGPR for reforestation of conifer seedlings, and indicate that benefits of a single inoculation at planting can extend through the second year in the field. In addition, bacteria capable of colonizing the seedling interior may be more effective PGPR for spruce than those restricted to the rhizosphere and the root surface. However, site specific seedling growth promotion may necessitate matching PGPR strains to outplanting sites for effective growth promotion.

The millipede exhibited a preference for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and, to a lesser extent, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere) litter compared with western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) litter when given a choice. When only one litter type was provided, millipedes consumed considerably more western redcedar than Douglas-fir, Sitka spruce, or western hemlock. Among the six broadleaf species tested, paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh), vine maple (Acer circinatum Pursh), and red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) were consumed at much higher rates than swordfern (Polystichum munitum (Kaulf.) Presl.) or salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh). Daily rates of conifer litter consumption ranged between 10 and 20% of the millipede's fresh biomass and may translate to 36% of the annual litter fall. Our results suggest that transformation of conifer litter into millipede frass can increase rates of litter decomposition and N mineralization, as well as influence microbial activity and diversity in coastal forests.",,"decomposition; food preference; invertebrate; leaf litter; microbial community; mineralization; nitrogen; Canada; Acer circinatum; Acer macrophyllum; Alnus rubra; Betula papyrifera; Diplopoda; Gaultheria shallon; Harpaphe haydeniana; Picea sitchensis; Polystichum munitum; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Thuja plicata; Tsuga heterophylla",,,,,,"Anderson, J.M., Bignell, D.E., Bacteria in the food, gut contents and faeces of the litter-feeding millipede Glomeris marginata Villers (1980) Soil Biol.

Analysis of additional root-nodule forming, as well as root-associated bacterial species by PCR-primer assay revealed that variability within this 20-hp segment of the 23S rDNA region may be widespread and provide an effective identification tool.

In the glasshouse, the Rhizobium strain ILCA372str produced nearly ten times as much nodule DM, three times as much shoot DM, five times as much root DM, and twice as much plant N on cv. Safari as it did on accession ILCA7609 under normal watering conditions. This spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant strain performed better than its parent strain. Shoot DM and N yields of this combination were, however, only 55 and 71%, respectively, of the corresponding N-fertilizer (150 kg N ha-1) treatment. Waterlogging reduced nodule DM by 33%, shoot DM by 41%, root DM by 25% and N yield by 33%, and responses of both plant genotypes to inoculation and to N fertilizer were reduced. In the field, there were no significant differences in nodulation, plant DM and plant N between seed and soil inoculation methods. Dry matter and N yields of Safari inoculated with strain ILCA372str were at least twice as high as those produced by any other strain or N fertilizer supplied at 100 kg N ha-1. Waterlogging during early establishment in the field probably reduced the availability of N fertilizer to the plants. Further field testing of the Safari-ILCA372str combination is recommended, particularly in combination with broad-bed and furrow (BBF) technology to drain Vertisols.",,"Rhizobium; Trifolium semipilosum",,,,,,"Amager, N., Competition for nodule formation between effective and ineffective strains of Rhizobium meliloti (1981) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 13, pp. 475-480; Bishnoi, N.R., Chrishnamoorthy, H.H., Effect of waterlogging and gibberellic acid on nodulation and nitrogen fixation in peanut (1992) Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 28, pp. 663-666; Bisseling, T., Van Staveru, W., Van Kammen, A., The effect of waterlogging on the synthesis of nitrogen compounds in bacteroids of Rhizobium leguminosarum in root nodules of Pisum sativum L.

In T. burchellianum, contrast analysis revealed that there was no significant response to inoculation, although one effective strain was identified. Inoculant strains failed to overcome the competitive dominance of indigenous strains as reflected in mean nodule occupancies by inoculant strains of 15 and 7% in T. semipilosum and T. burchellianum, respectively. The 20 strains showed variable persistence following a 5-week drought period; only two of eight (T. semipilosum) and six of eight (T. burchellianum) strains were recovered from nodules on seedlings planted in the soil following the drought period. Overcoming the constraints of low nodule occupancy and variable persistence will require further understanding of the competitive interaction and the factors affecting access to nodule infection sites if superior Rhizobium-clover combinations are to be identified and developed.",,"Rhizobium",,,,,,"(1988) Legume-Rhizobium Symbiosis: Methods Manual for Evaluation, Selection and Agronomic Management, , Cali: CIAT; Dowling, D.N., Broughton, W.J., Competition for nodulation of legumes (1986) Annual Review of Microbiology, 40, pp. 131-157; Friedericks, J.B., Hagehorn, C., Vanscoyok, S.W., Isolation of Rhizobium leguminosarum (biovar trifolii) strains from Ethiopian soils and symbiotic effectiveness on African annual clover species (1990) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 56, pp. 1087-11082; Friedericks, J.B., Hagehorn, C., Reneau, R.B., Evaluation of African annual clovers to moisture stress in two Ethiopian highland soils (1991) Plant and Soil, 133, pp. 271-279; Giller, K.E., Cadisch, G., Future benefits from biological nitrogen fixation: An ecological approach to agriculture (1995) Plant and Soil, 174, pp. 255-277; Howieson, J.G., Rhizobial persistence and its role in the development of sustainable agricultural systems in Mediterranean environments (1995) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 27, pp. 595-610; Jones, R.M., Date, R.A., Studies on the nodulation of Kenya white clover (Trifolium semipilosum) under field conditions in south-east Queensland (1975) Australian Journal of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, 15, pp. 519-526; Kahurananga, J., Tsehay, A., Preliminary assessment of some annual Ethiopian Trifolium species for hay production (1984) Tropical Grasslands, 18, pp. 215-217; Kuykendall, L.D., Isolation and identification of genetically marked strains of nitrogen fixing microsymbionts of soybeans (1987) Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation Technology, pp. 205-220. , (Ed.

Addition of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to the growth medium enhanced root hair formation in P. vulgaris, in the absence of AVG. The inhibitory effect of AVG on root hair formation was reversed by the combined presence of Rhizobium etli TAL 182 and Bacillus megaterium S49 on P. vulgaris roots. Plants that received single inoculation of either Rhizobium TAL 182 or Bacillus S49 did not show enhancement of root hair formation when AVG was present in the growing medium. These results are consistent with the action of ACC as a positive regulator of root hair morphogenesis. The data suggest that the bacterial interaction may act through the ethylene biosyntheses pathway to enhance root hair morphogenesis, and to disrupt the normal pattern of root epidermal cell development.","Bacillus; Ethylene; Rhizobium; Root hairs","Bacillus megaterium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Phaseolus vulgaris; Phaseolus vulgaris; Rhizobium; Rhizobium etli",,,,,,"Abeles, F.B., Morgan, P.W., Saltveit Jr., M.E., (1992) Ethylene in Plant Biology, , Academic Press, San Diego; Adams, D.O., Yang, S.F., Ethylene biosynthesis: Identification of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid as an intermediate in the conversion of methionine to ethylene (1979) Proc.

The simultaneous presence of both Rhizobium etli TAL 182 and Bacillus megaterium S49 on plant roots during the early stages of plant growth was necessary for enhanced nodulation of Phaseolus vulgaris by the Rhizobium microsymbiont. Coinoculation with both bacterial species also facilitated heterologous nodulation of Rhizobium TAL 182 on Phaseolus acutifolius. These results are consistent with earlier reports of increased root hair proliferation and lateral root formation in response to coinoculation. Split-root experiments revealed that coinoculation partially suppressed host-controlled regulation of nodulation, implicating a plant interaction with the two bacterial species. Changes to the nodulation potential of R. etli due to coinoculation with Bacillus spp. demonstrate the potential for root-associated organisms other than rhizobia to alter the dynamics of the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis.","Bacillus; heterologous nodulation; nodulation enhancement","article; bacillus; nodulation; nonhuman; plant growth; plant root; priority journal; rhizobium; symbiosis; Bacillus; Phaseolus vulgaris; Rhizobium etli; Fabaceae; Phaseolus acutifolius; Rhizobium etli; bacteria; nodulation; rhizobacteria",,,,,,"Allen, O.N., Allen, E.K., (1981) The Leguminosae, a Source Book of Characteristics, Uses and Nodulation, pp. 511-515. , University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, Wis; Bal, A.K., Shantaram, S., Wong, P.P., Nodulation of pole bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by Rhizobium species of two cross-inoculation groups (1982) Appl.

Some of the Bacillus isolates produced significant amounts of the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) when grown in a liquid culture medium supplemented with 100 μg L-tryptophan/L; less IAA was produced in culture medium not supplemented with L-tryptophan. Thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the avena coleoptile bioassay were used to identify and quantify IAA produced by Bacillus isolates. Significant differences were observed in the amounts of IAA produced by different strains of Bacillus, with amounts varying from 0.40 to 4.88 μg/mL. α-Methyltryptophan-resistant mutants of Bacillus exhibited altered IAA production and excreted tryptophan into the growing medium. The IAA-producing Bacillus isolates promoted root growth and (or) nodulation when coinoculated with Rhizobium etli (TAL 182) on Phaseolus vulgaris 'Contender' under gnotobiotic conditions in growth chambers. Coinoculation resulted in increased nodule number, nodule fresh weight, nitrogenase activity, leghemoglobin content, and total soluble protein content in the root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris. In contrast, coinoculation with α-methyltryptophan mutants resulted in decreased nodulation, indicating that Bacillus isolates have a direct effect on either the Rhizobium or the plant and the effect may not be singularly attributed to their ability to produce IAA in vitro.","Bacillus; Indoleacetic acid production; Nodulation enhancement","indoleacetic acid; article; bacillus; bacterium identification; bacterium isolation; controlled study; nodulation; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; rhizobium",,"indoleacetic acid, 32536-43-9, 87-51-4",,,,"Appleby, C.A., Bergersen, F.J., Preparation and experimental use of leghemoglobin (1980) Methods of Evaluating Biological Nitrogen Fixation, pp. 315-335. , Edited by F.J.

Two spruce ecotypes (from Mackenzie and Salmon Arm, British Columbia) and two bacterial strains previously isolated from naturally regenerating seedlings of each spruce ecotype were evaluated. Planting trials were conducted in the ecosystem from which each spruce ecotype and associated bacterial strain were originally collected, and at two alternative sites. Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava, which was isolated from Mackenzie spruce seedlings, caused increases in seedling biomass or branch number of up to 49%, but was most effective as a root growth promoter of the Salmon Arm spruce ecotype. Pseudomonas putida, which originated from Salmon Arm spruce seedlings, increased seedling biomass or branch number in two trials, but had inhibitory effects in three others. There was no indication that growth promotion was related to a common ecotypic origin of seedlings and rhizobacteria, or that bacteria were more effective in the ecosystem from which they were originally isolated. However, Salmon Arm spruce growth promotion by H. pseudoflava was greatest at the poorest quality planting site.","field trials; inoculation; PGPR; spruce","article; growth; hydrogenophaga; inoculation; nonhuman; plant; priority journal; pseudomonas putida; symbiosis; rhizobacteria; spruce; Canada, British Columbia, Mackenzie; Canada, British Columbia, Salmon Arm; Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava; Picea engelmannii; Picea glauca; Pseudomonas putida",,,,,,,"Chanway, C.P.; Department of Forest Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",,,,,,,,00084166,,CJMIA,,"English","CAN.

Inoculation resulted in statistically significant seedling biomass increases after 8 weeks of pine growth. The L6-16R rhizosphere population declined by an order of magnitude per month, from ca. 106 cfu/g dry weight of pine root tissue 4 weeks past inoculation to ca. 104 cfu/g of root tissue 12 weeks past inoculation. Seedlings from three of four pine provenances had mean shoot and root dry weight increases of up to 35% due to seed inoculation, but shoot growth of the fourth provenance was inhibited. The size of the L6-16R rhizosphere population was not correlated to the magnitude of the shoot growth response 4 weeks after inoculation, but it showed a strong correlation with shoot growth 8 weeks after inoculation.

Plant growth and developmental responses in this greenhouse experiment have demonstrated the effectiveness of the two kelp foliar sprays as plant growth regulating substances. Bean growth and developmental responses to the kelp foliar spray treatments were dependent upon the soil moisture regime to which they have been subjected. Although the two kelp foliar sprays had varying and sometimes contrasting effects on bean growth and N nutrition, which were dependent on the soil moisture treatment, their developmental effects upon the number of nodes, shoot/root ratio, leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were quite similar. A soybean callus bioassay demonstrated the presence of cytokinin-like substances and a callus growth antagonist in the kelp concentrate.

Shoot tip cultures were also established to induce multiple shoots for regeneration of plants via organogenesis. Regenerants from different regeneration pathways were evaluated for chromosome number stability, morphology and several biochemical traits. Regenerated plants showed stable isozyme banding patterns for malate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglucomutase and shikimate dehydrogenase, as well as their nodule leghemoglobin profiles. Variations were detected in the chromosome number of some regenerants as well as in leaflet length-to-width ratio and leaflet number.

Plant growth responses to inoculation varied from slightly negative (perennial ryegrass) to highly positive (white clover and crested wheatgrass) when root, shoot and plant dry weights were measured. Root-to-shoot ratios were also increased in the latter two species. Seedling emergence in crested wheatgrass was shown to be enhanced by inoculation with the bacterium. Possible mechanisms of the growth response include suppression of pathogenic organisms in the rhizosphere by the inoculant strain, root-associated nitrogen fixation, solubilization of phosphorus compounds or the bacterial production of plant growth-promoting substances. Use of sterilized soil in experiments and a lack of antibiotic production by the Bacillus render the first possibility unlikely. However, in vitro assays showed the bacterium to possess an active nitrogenase, to be capable of solubilizing organic but not inorganic phosphate compounds, and to produce indoleacetic acid, but not detectable amounts of cytokinins or gibberellins. Experimentation with A. cristatum suggested solubilization of P may be involved in enhanced seedling emergence, but neither N fixation nor phosphate solubilization were the primary contributing factors to the observed growth response. The data support the contention that production of growth-promoting compounds similar in activity to indoleacetic acid by the bacterium is the likely stimulus for the observed increase in plant productivity. © 1988.",,,,,,,,"Brown, Seed and root bacterization (1974) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 12, pp. 181-197; Buchanan, Gibbons, (1974) Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, , 8th edn., Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore; Burns, Jr, Bishop, Israel, Enhanced nodulation of leguminous plant roots by mixed cultures of Azotobacter vinelandii and Rhizobium (1981) Plant and Soil, 62, pp. 399-412; Chanway, Holl, Suitability of intrinsic antibiotic resistance as a method of strain identification in Rhizobium trifolii (1986) Plant and Soil, 93, pp. 287-291; Cooper, Bacterial fertilizers in the Soviet Union (1959) Soils & Fertilizers, 22, pp. 327-333; Dilworth, Acetylene reduction by nitrogen-fixing preparations from Clostridium pasteurianum (1966) Biochimica Biophysica Acta, 127, pp. 285-294; Duff, Webley, Scott, Solubilization of minerals and related materials by 2-ketogluconic acid producing bacteria (1963) Soil Science, 95, pp. 105-114; El-Bahrawy, Associative effect of mixed cultures of Azotobacter and different rhizosphere fungi with Rhizobium japonicum on nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation of soybean (1983) Zenlralblatt für Mikrobiologie (Jena), 138, pp. 443-449; Gaskins, Albrecht, Hubbell, Rhizosphere bacteria and their use to increase plant productivity: a review (1985) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 12, pp. 99-116; Jones, Waid, Influence of fungal isolates on germination and growth of perennial ryegrass (1963) Plant and Soil, 19, pp. 139-150; Kapulnik, Feldman, Okon, Contribution of nitrogen fixed by Azospirillum to the nitrogen nutrition of spring wheat in Israel (1985) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 17, pp. 509-515; Kingman, Moore, Isolation purification and quantitation of several growth regulating substances in Ascopohyllum nodosum (Phaeophyta) (1982) Botanica Marina, 25, pp. 149-153; Kundu, Gaur, Establishment of nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilizing bacteria in rhizosphere and their effect on yield and nutrient uptake of wheat crop (1980) Plant and Soil, 57, pp. 223-230; Miller, Evidence for the natural occurrence of zeatin and derivatives.

In examining more than two thousand samples from the USDA Plant Introduction Collection, host-determined genetic variation in dinitrogen fixation has been found. In genetic analysis of a mutant line of Pisum resistant to nodulation, two genes designated Sym2 and Sym3 have been detected; Sym2 affects nodulation while Sym3 influences fixation. The two genes segregate independently as dominant Mendelian characters. Effective symbiosis requires the presence of at least one dominant gene at each locus. © 1975 H.
