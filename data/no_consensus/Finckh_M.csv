(Fabaceae)], over a 5-year period. Cellulose pheromone dispensers were manually attached to the top shoots of pea plants and released 540 mg ha-1 day-1 synthetic pheromone E8,E10-dodecadien-1-yl acetate in a first test series (2000-2001) and ca. 4 200 mg pheromone ha-1 day-1 in a second series (2004-2006). The dispensers had a half-life of about 30 days. Although male attraction to pheromone monitoring traps was largely suppressed at the edges and within MD fields in both test series, MD treatments did not reduce pod infestation in the open field in 2000 and 2001. In the 2004-2006 series, larval damage reduction was achieved in the majority of the trials but overall MD efficacy in the open field was only 61% and not significant. In contrast, in field cages placed within the experimental sites and supplied with unmated pea moths, MD control was consistently high and significant. There were no obvious differences in the larval age distribution in all MD and control treatments, suggesting that infestations started and developed further similarly. As a univoltine species, C. nigricana larvae stay in the soil of pea fields for hibernation and pupate. The following year, emerging adults disperse and fly to the closest pea crop. Combined emergence site and pea crop treatments were conducted over 2 years to include this early migration phase of C. nigricana adults. However, the emergence site treatments did not enhance MD-control efficacy. We conclude that mating activity was only prevented in cage tests, whereas substantial mating occurred during the transit phase outside the pheromone-treated fields either within non-crop vegetation and/or at the edges of pheromone-treated pea fields orientated upwind. Thus, resulting gravid female entry can be regarded as the major constraint to reliable MD control. © 2014 The Netherlands Entomological Society.","Fabaceae; Lepidoptera; Mating disruption control; Organic farming; Synthetic sex-pheromone; Tortricidae",,,,,,,"(1990) SAS© Procedures Guide, Version 6, , Anonymous.

Here we identify the concept of resilience as a universally applicable and fundamentally important criterion of health in all relevant areas of agriculture. We discuss definitions of resilience for soils, plants, animals, humans and ecosystems, and explore ways in which resilience can be applied as a criterion of health in different agricultural contexts. We show how and why resilience can be seen as a key criterion of health. Based on this, we discuss how resilience can be used as a link between soil, plant, animal, human and ecosystem health. Finally, we highlight four key areas for future research on resilience in agriculture, namely spatial and temporal scaling of resilience; effects of diversity; the role of networks for resilience; and stakeholder involvement. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.","Agriculture; Concept; Health; Resilience; Stability; Stress","Animalia; Soil; adaptation, physiological; agriculture; animals; ecosystem; Food Supply; Health; Humans; Livestock; Plants; Soil; Adaptation, Physiological; Agriculture; Animals; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Health; Humans; Livestock; Plants; Soil",,"Soil",,,,"Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference (1946), New York, 19-22 June, 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948Hawkes, C., Ruel, M.T., International Food Policy Research Institute (2006), http://www.ifpri.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/publications/focus13_01.pdf, [Online].

A differential two-level diagnostic test system was established under controlled conditions using peas (Pisum sativum L.) as test plants. Soils from 22 organically managed sites with unexplained moderate to high pea yield losses were tested in level 1 diagnostics (γ-irradiation to eliminate potentially harmful organisms, nutrient additions to compensate for potential nutrient deficiencies or activated charcoal amendment to bind and thereby to immobilize potentially phytotoxic compounds). Results showed that organisms harmful to the test plant were the primary cause of limited germination and growth in most of the sampled soils, whereas a positive effect of nutrient addition was rarely found and toxins were not involved. Level 2 diagnostics (pesticides targeting ascomycetes, oomycetes, Rhizoctonia spp., nematodes) further narrowed down the organisms involved in yield depressions. Oomycetes were identified as the primary reason for limited germination rates, and, in some soils, also for limited growth of established seedlings. In other soils, a multitude rather than a single group of pathogens was involved in limited growth. Plant-pathogenic nematodes were never found to be limiting for crop growth parameters. Harmful effects of pesticides were found in several soils, hinting at an important role of beneficial soil organisms in the suppression of pathogens causing yield depression in legumes. The bioassay used in the present study was robust and could thus serve as a low-cost tool for agricultural advisors and farmers to predict the risk of yield losses in legumes and to narrow down causes, helping them to develop appropriate strategies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Oomycetes; Organic agriculture; Pea; Soil fatigue; Soil-borne plant pathogens",,,,,,,"Allmaras, R.R., Fritz, V.A., Pfleger, F.L., Copeland, S.M., Impaired internal drainage and Aphanomyces euteiches root rot of pea caused by soil compaction in a fine-textured soil (2003) Soil Tillage Res., 70, pp. 41-52; La fatigue des sols (1982) La fatigue des sols. 23ème colloque SFP, , Anon. les Colloques de l'INRA, Paris, Versaille, Anon.

For each crop, four samples were taken from one field. Additionally, an attempt was made to study the relationship between soil physico-chemical properties and AMF colonization rates, spore densities, species richness and other selected AMF diversity indices. The mean percentage of AMF colonization across all crops was 34%, ranging from 19% to 50%. The spore densities retrieved from the different rhizospheres were relatively high, varying from 344 to 1222 spores per 100 g dry soil with a mean of 798. There was no correlation between AMF spore densities in the soil and the root colonization rates. A total of 42 morphologically classifiable species representing 14 genera of AMF were detected without correlation between species richness in the soil and the spore densities. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the similarity among AMF communities with respect to crop species overall showed that species compositions were relatively similar to the highest dissimilarities of about 25% dividing three of the four mango samples and the four sorghum samples from all other samples. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","AMF community; AMF infection; ecosystem; soil properties; spore extraction","Arbuscular; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Sorghum (genus)",,,,,"DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service","Azcón-Aguilar, C., Barea, J.M., Arbuscular mycorrhizas and biological control of soil-borne plant pathogens - an overview of the mechanisms involved (1997) Mycorrhiza, 6, pp. 457-464; Biermann, B., Linderman, R.G., Use of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal roots, intraradical vesicles and extraradical vesicles as inoculum (1983) New Phytol, 95, pp. 97-105; Boddington, C.L., Dodd, J.C., The effect of agricultural practices on the development of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

The use of molecular markers has hugely increased the knowledge about genetic diversity and great hopes are raised about the potential of marker assisted selection [MAS; sometimes also termed SMART breeding (Selection with Markers and Advanced Reproductive Technologies)] to help increasing the use of PGR and maintaining crop genetic diversity. Another approach growing attention has been paid to over the past two decades and which also aims to increase variation in crops is evolutionary and participatory breeding (EPB). In this paper we discuss both the potential of marker-assisted breeding strategies and the potential of EPB breeding to contribute to the maintenance, increase and development of agrobiodiversity. The potentials of molecular markers in the evaluation and use of PGR and their documented contribution to agrobiodiversity are reviewed and results from guided interviews with scientists and breeders are given. Despite tremendous research efforts involving molecular markers, it is still difficult to obtain a clear picture how molecular markers contribute to the use of PGR in plant breeding. Minor and major crops do not benefit to the same degree from recent developments in marker technology. It therefore depends at least in part on economic considerations whether SMART breeding or EPB strategies or both are implemented in the breeding process of a crop. A general decision in favor or against MAS or EPB when breeding for diversity would not yield optimum results. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Evolutionary breeding; MAS; Molecular markers; Plant genetic resources; Pre-breeding; Seed legislation",,,,,,,"Allard, R.W., Jain, S.K., Population studies in predominantly self-pollinated species.

Late blight severity was significantly reduced on plants fertilized with Bio-ILSA and BioFeed Basis compared to plants fertilized with Horn meal and chemical fertilizer. There were no interactions between fertilizers and isolates or between fertilizers and cultivars. All plant strengtheners significantly reduced susceptibility of all tomato cultivars. However, effects were isolate and tomato cultivar specific. The reductions in area under the disease progress curve compared to the water control for the different tomato cultivars and isolates were 23-78%, 21-77%, 17-66%, and 37-100% for Alfalfa extract, PEN, QUALITY and BABA, respectively. Similar, but somewhat smaller reductions were observed for sporulation capacity. The plant strengtheners were more effective in controlling disease on plants challenged with isolate mixtures than on plants challenged with single isolates. BABA performed significantly better than the plant strengtheners in 65% (i. e., 34 out of 54) of the tested cultivar-isolate combinations, when single isolates were used. When two isolates were mixed, the percentage was reduced to 45% (25 out of 54 cases) and to 33%, (6 out of 18 cases) with a mixture of three isolates. © 2012 KNPV.","BABA; Disease control; Isolate specific effects; Mixture effects; Sporulation capacity","cultivar; disease control; disease severity; fertilizer application; fruit; infectivity; pathogen; sporulation; Lycopersicon esculentum; Medicago sativa; Phytophthora infestans",,,,,,"http://www.agrobio-products.nl/uk/files-uk/UK-GROW.pdf, AgroBio Products.

In particular, (i) the role of values in defining plant health in a naturalist versus a normativist approach; (ii) negative and positive definitions of plant health; (iii) reductionist versus holistic perspectives; (iv) the focus on functionality versus resilience, i.e. the ability of the plant to perform under stress with or without human interference; (v) materialist versus vitalist approaches; and (vi) biocentric versus anthropocentric views, are surveyed. The ways in which these perspectives relate to mainstream and alternative approaches to plant protection are explored and we suggest how the contradicting views might be reconciled. It is argued that none of these perspectives is without inherent contradictions, but that by combining contrasting approaches it is possible to provide a comprehensive though fuzzy concept. Rather than giving a new definition of plant health, a conceptual framework is developed that suggests what questions may be answered in debates on plant health issues and how such debates could be organized. © 2011 The Authors.

In a more detailed trial, six of the accessions were assessed for inducibility of resistance to six P. infestans isolates on three leaves of different age per plant. Plants were inoculated 1 week after treatment with BABA. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), sporulation capacity (SC) and infection efficiency (IE) were all affected by treatment with BABA. On leaves of all ages AUDPC was most affected by induction (43-100% reduction on the youngest leaves) followed by SC (14-100%) and IE (0-100% reduction). Tomato genotypes varied significantly in inducibility of resistance against P. infestans and the degree of induction generally decreased with increasing leaf age, whilst the absolute susceptibility with respect to AUDPC and SC rarely changed. The level of induction was not always related to the resistance level of the tomato accession and it was significantly influenced by the pathogen isolate used for challenge inoculation. The results show that inducibility of resistance is a selectable trait that is, however, isolate-specific. © 2010 The Authors.

An interdisciplinary network of European scientists put forward visions for future crop production embracing the complexity of our socio-ecological system by applying the principle of diversity at all levels from soil micro-organisms to plant varieties and cropping systems. This approach, integrated with careful deployment of our finite global resources and implementation of appropriate sustainable technology, appears to be the only way to ensure the scale of system resilience needed to cope with many of our concerns. We discuss some of the most important tools such as (i) building soil fertility by recycling of nutrients and sustainable use of other natural and physical resources, (ii) enhancing biological diversity by breeding of crops resilient to climate change and (iii) reconnecting all stakeholders in crop production. Finally, we emphasise some of the changes in agricultural and environmental regulation and policy needed in order to implement the visions. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.",,,,,,,,"Long, S., Ainsworth, E., Leakey, A., Nösberger, J., Ort, D., Food for thought: Lower-than-expected crop yield stimulation with rising CO2 concentrations (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1918-1921; Kiers, E.T., Leakey, R.R.B., Izac, A.-M., Heinemann, J.A., Rosenthal, E., Nathan, D., Agriculture at a crossroads (2008) Science, 320, pp. 320-321; Pimentel, D., Pimentel, M., Global environmental resources versus world population growth (2006) Ecol Econ, 59, pp. 195-198; Costanza, R., D'arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 253-260; (2005) Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Biodiversity Synthesis, , Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, World Resources Institute, Washington, DC; (2002) Harvesting Energy with Fertilizers, , http://cms.efma.org/EPUB/easnet.dll/ExecReq/Page?eas:template_im=000BC2&eas:dat_im=000C23, European Fertilizer Manufacturers Association, [Online], Available, [17 December 2008]; Lal, R., Anthropogenic influences on world soils and implications to global food security (2007) Adv Agron, 93, pp. 69-93; Tan, Z.X., Wiebke, K.D., Lal, R., Global soil nutrient depletion and yield reduction (2005) J Sustain Agric, 26, pp. 123-146; Holland, J.M., The environmental consequences of adopting conservation tillage in Europe: Reviewing the evidence (2004) Agric Ecosyst Environ, 103, pp. 1-25; Lal, R., Managing world soils for food security and environmental quality (2001) Adv Agron, 74, pp. 155-192; Oldeman, L.R., (1992) Global Extent of Soil Degradation, , International Soil and Information Center, Wageningen; Oldeman, L.R., Makkeling, R.T.A., Sombroek, W.G., (1992) World Map of the Status of Human-induced Soil Degradation: An Explanatory Note, , (2nd edn).

However, this cropping system might become more popular in the future given raising prices for green gram and maize grain and scarcity of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizers in this Asian country. The results of a cropping systems experiment with continuous maize versus a green gram-maize rotation, manure application (0 and 2 t ha-1) and phosphorus (P) fertilization (0 and 15 kg P ha-1) in each of five consecutive seasons revealed a strong decline in total dry matter and grains yields for both crops irrespective of the treatment. Treatment effects on yield components, nutrient concentrations, mycorrhizal infection and nematode infestation were small or negligible. The data show that in addition to manure used at 2 t ha-1, application of mineral N fertilizers is essential to maintain particularly maize yields. A comparison of different green gram cultivars did not indicate genotype specific effects on maize growth. The incorporation of legume residues, unless they are used as animal feed, is recommended to increase the recycling of N and to balance N fluxes when green gram is cultivated for seed.","Green gram; Maize; Manure; Myanmar; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rotation","Animalia; Vigna radiata var. radiata; Zea mays",,,,,,"AHMAD, T., HAFEEZ, F.Y., MAHMOOD, T., MALIK, K.A., Residual effect of nitrogen fixed by mungbean and blackgram on subsequent rice and wheat crops (2001) Australian Journal Experimental Agriculture, 41, pp. 245-248; BAGAYOKO, M., ALVEY, S., NEUMANN, G., Buerkert, A., Root-induced increases in soil pH and nutrient availability to field-grown cereals and legumes on acid sandy soils of Sudano-Sahelian West Africa (2000) Plant and Soil, 225, pp. 117-127; BAGAYOKO, M., Buerkert, A., LUNG, G., BATIONO, A., RÖMHELD, V., Cereal/legume rotation effects on cereal growth in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa: Soil mineral nitrogen, mycorrhizae and nematodes (2000) Plant and Soil, 218, pp. 103-116; BAGAYOKO, M., GEORGE, E., RÖMHELD, V., BUERKERT, A., Effects of mycorrhizae and phosphorus on growth and nutrient uptake of millet, cowpea and sorghum on a West African soil (2000) Journal of Agricultual Science, 135, pp. 399-407; BATIONO, A., CHRISTIANSON, B.C., BAETHGEN, W.E., MOKWUNYE, A.U., A farm-level evaluation of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use and planting density for pearl millet production in Niger (1992) Fertilizer Research, 31, pp. 175-184; BUERKERT, A., BAGAYOKO, M., ALVEY, S., BATIONO, A., Causes of legume-rotation effects in increasing cereal yields across the Sudanian, Sahelian and Guinean zone of West Africa (2001) Plant nutrition, food security and sustainability of agroecosystems through basic and applied research.

To identify yield constraints, input intensities and the general practices of rice cultivation in Myanmar, a survey was conducted during the wet seasons of 2001 and 2002. A total of 98 farmers from five townships in Upper Myanmar and 16 in Lower Myanmar representing the most important areas of rice production were questioned on their management practices, yields, and perceived yield constraints over the previous four years. There was a recent decrease in the overall average rate of fertilizer application, an increase in the prevalence of rice-legume cropping systems, and only localized insect pest or disease problems. Additionally, rice yields were found to be higher in Upper Myanmar, likely the results of more suitable weather conditions, better irrigation, and ready market access. Furthermore, a number of critical factors affecting production are identified and possible solutions discussed.","Burma; Myanmar; Rice diseases","Hexapoda",,,,,,"DOBERMANN, A., DAWE, D., REIMUND, P., ROETTER, R.P., CASSMAN, K.G., Reversal of Rice Yield Decline in a Long-Term Continuous Cropping Experiment (2000) Agron.

In addition, difficulties in marketing the produce are emphasised. The question thus arises if and how such strategies can be designed to find a place in modern agriculture. Considering the general ecological benefits of diversification and the possible economical benefits for growers and society, several possible approaches to the solution of actual and perceived problems in modern agriculture are discussed. An important route towards achieving diversity would be to integrate it into the breeding process. Selection criteria would include inducibility of resistance and competitive ability, in order to produce diversified varieties able to adapt both to unpredictable environmental conditions (especially climatic) and to changing pest and pathogen populations through co-evolution. Evolutionary breeding methods such as composite crosses and modern landraces and some of the legal problems associated with these approaches are discussed. Technical solutions are integral to the future use of diversification strategies and range from more or less simple adjustments to machinery for planting and harvesting to devices designed for separation of the harvested products. © 2008 Springer Netherlands.","Co-evolution; Composite crosses; Evolutionary breeding; Intercropping; Mixtures; Plant varietal protection",,,,,,,"Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1961) Crop Science, 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., Genetic changes associated with the evolution of adaptedness in cultivated plants and their wild progenitors (1988) Journal of Heredity, 79, pp. 225-238; Altieri, M.A., (1995) Agroecology.

Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans Mont. De Bary is one of the most important diseases in organic potatoes and besides varietal resistance its management in Germany relies mainly on the limited use of protective copper based fungicides. The currently allowed amounts of copper of 3 kg ha-1 and year are more than necessary for plant nutrition and thus are in contrast to the aim of sustainability of organic farming. The results of the presented studies show that it is usually possible to achieve good disease control with only 1-1.5 kg Cu ha-1 even under high disease pressure with the help of the forecasting model BioPhyto-PRE which was developed for organic farming. To increase the efficiency of less effective fungicides such as plant extracts in organic farming, disease pressure has to be reduced as much as possible by management approaches. Four on-farm experiments showed that strip intercropping of potatoes does reduce disease pressure in 12-16 m wide strips with neighbour spring wheat or carrots. A cost-benefit analysis using the prices of the year 2004 showed that growing potatoes without treatment in most cases was the most lucrative option with slightly increased benefits by strip cropping the potatoes. Multiple stepwise regressions show that in organic farming the yield loss relationships between late blight and potatoes can only be determined when N-uptake is integrated into the model. Overall, only very limited yield benefits are achieved by the application of copper fungicides, in most cases due to the limited nutrient supply in organic systems. It is concluded that an integrated forecasting model for late blight management in organic farming will have to include data on growth stage dependent plant nutrient uptake and variety specific properties to allow for efficient and minimised fungicide applications. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","BioPhyto-PRE; Late blight; Nutrient dynamics; Organic potato production; Yield loss","cost-benefit analysis; disease resistance; disease treatment; efficiency measurement; fungicide; integrated approach; intercropping; multiple regression; nutritional requirement; organic farming; potato; yield response; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Daucus carota; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Adler, N., Appel, R., Habermeyer, J., Field experiments with seed treatment against late blight (2001) Appl Res Arable Farming Field Prod Veg, 7, pp. 153-163; Alloway, B.J., (1995) Heavy Metals in Soils, , Blackie Academic and Professional, London Glasgow; Andrivon, D., Lucas, J., Ellisseche, D., Development of natural late blight epidemics in pure and mixed plots of potato cultivars with different levels of partial resistance (2003) Plant Path, 52, pp. 586-594; Bélanger, G., Walsh, J., Richards, J.E., Milburn, P.H., Ziadi, N., Comparison of three statistical models describing potato yield response to nitrogen fertilizer (2000) Agron J, 92, pp. 902-908; Beuermann, H., Huber, T., Finckh, M.R., Auswirkungen von Anbaustrategien auf den Befallsverlauf mit Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary und Kartoffelerträge im Ökolandbau (2000) Mitt Biol Bundesanst Land-Forstwirt, 376, pp. 356-357; Bouws, H., Finckh, M.R., Effects of cropping history and origin of seed potatoes on population structure of Phytophthora infestans (2007) Eur J Plant Path, 117, pp. 313-327; Bouws, H., Finckh, M.R., Effects of strip-intercropping of potatoes with non-hosts on late blight severity and tuber yield (2008) Plant Path, 57, pp. 916-927; Bruns, C., Schulte-Geldermann, E., Hayer, F., Finckh, M.R., Kupferminimierungsstrategien zu Kontrolle von Phytophthora infestans vor dem Hintergrund von Befallsprognose und der Nährstoffversorgung von Kartoffeln (2007) Ber Biol Bundesanst, 141, pp. 5-9. , In: Pflanzenschutz im ökologischen Landbau - Probleme und Lösungsansätze, 12.

It is not known whether Sclerotinia soft rot also affects wild carrots (D. carota ssp. carota), which hybridise and exchange genes, among them resistance genes, with the cultivated carrot. We investigated the susceptibility of wild carrots to S. sclerotiorum isolates from cultivated carrot under controlled and outdoor conditions. Inoculated roots from both wild and cultivated plants produced sclerotia and soft rot in a growth chamber test. Two isolates differed significantly in the ability to produce lesions and sclerotia on roots of both wild carrots and cv. Bolero. Flowering stems of wild carrots produced dry, pale lesions after inoculation with the pathogen, and above-ground plant weight was significantly reduced 4 weeks after inoculation in a greenhouse test. Wild and cultivar rosette plants died earlier and fewer plants survived when inoculated with the pathogen under outdoor test conditions. Cultivar plants died earlier than wild plants, but survived as frequently. Plants inoculated in the crown died earlier and at a lower frequency than plants inoculated on leaves. Wild carrots may thus serve as a host of S. sclerotiorum and thus eventually benefit from any uptake of resistance genes, among them transgenes, via introgression from cultivated carrots. © 2008 KNPV.","Genetically modified crops; Pathogenicity; Risk assessment; Wild plant-pathogen interactions","flowering; fungal disease; fungus; pathogenicity; risk assessment; root vegetable; storage; survival; Daucus; Daucus carota; Sclerotinia; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum",,,,,,"Andow, D.A., Zwahlen, C., Assessing environmental risks of transgenic plants (2006) Ecology Letters, 9, pp. 196-214; Boland, G.J., Hall, R., Index of plant hosts of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (1994) Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology, 16, pp. 93-108; Bourdôt, G.W., Harvey, I.C., Hurrell, G.A., Saville, D.J., Demographic and biomass production consequences of inundative treatment of Circium arvense with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (1995) Biocontrol Science and Technology, 5, pp. 11-25; Brandenburg, W.A., Possible relationships between wild and cultivated carrots (Daucus carota L.) in the Netherlands (1981) Kulturpflanze, 29, pp. 369-375; Burdon, J.J., Thrall, P.H., Ericson, L., The current and future dynamics of disease in plant communities (2006) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 4, pp. 19-39; Chen, W.P., Punja, Z.K., Transgenic herbicide- and disease-tolerant carrot (Daucus carota L.) plants obtained through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (2002) Plant Cell Reporter, 20, pp. 929-935; Conner, A.J., Glare, T.R., Nap, J.P., The release of genetically modified crops into the environment - Part II.

Disease progress was assessed in 12-18 sections per plot and yields determined from the same sections. In 2000, plot size was 3 × 10 m and there were no disease reductions apparently due to interplot interference. In 2001 and 2002, with plot sizes of 6 × 18 and 6 × 36 m in strip-cropped potatoes, disease was significantly reduced by 9-20% and 4-12%, respectively, compared to pure stands of potato, with the greatest reductions in plots planted perpendicular to the wind and neighboured by grass-clover. The most important factors contributing to disease reduction were loss of inoculum outside of the plots and barrier effects of neighbouring non-potato hosts. Only 0-20% of the overall yield variation could be explained by the area under the disease progress curve, depending on cultivar and year. In one year disease effects on the yield of a moderately resistant cultivar were higher than on the yield of a susceptible cultivar. This was probably caused by differences in bulking behaviour. Nutrient limitation appeared to be more important than disease in reducing yields. Yields in the edge potato rows directly neighboured by cereals were significantly reduced in all 3 years, but competition by cereals did not change the disease-yield-loss relationship. Strip intercropping might be a useful component in an overall management strategy to reduce incoming late blight inoculum. © 2008 The Authors.","Diversification strategies; Epidemiology; Organic farming system; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum; Yield-loss relationship","cereal; crop production; crop yield; disease control; intercropping; legume; organic farming; potato; tuber; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum; Trifolium",,,,,,"Andrivon, D., Lucas, J.M.A., Ellisseche, D., Development of natural late blight epidemics in pure and mixed plots of potato cultivars with different levels of partial resistance (2003) Plant Pathology, 52, pp. 586-94; Aylor, D.E., Fry, W.E., Mayton, H., Andrade-Piedra, J.L., Quantifying the rate of release and escape of Phytophthora infestans sporangia from a potato canopy (2001) Phytopathology, 91, pp. 1189-96; Beuermann, H., Huber, T., Finckh, M.R., Auswirkungen von Anbaustrategien auf den Befallsverlauf mit Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary und Kartoffelerträge im Ökolandbau (2000) Mitteilungen Aus der Biologischen Bundesanstalt für Land- Und Forstwirtschaft, 376, pp. 356-7; Bouws, H., Finckh, M.R., Effects of cropping history and origin of seed potatoes on population structure of Phytophthora infestans (2007) European Journal of Plant Pathology, 117, pp. 313-27; Brümmer, G.W., Gerth, J., Herms, U., Heavy metal species, mobility and availability in soils (1986) Zeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde, 149, pp. 382-98; Büchse, A., Bouws-Beuermann, H., Finckh, M.R., Piepho, H.P., Modellierung räumlich und zeitlich strukturierter Daten am Beispiel eines Feldversuchs zur integrierten Bekämpfung der Kraut- und Knollenfäule im ökologischen Landbau (2005) Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Pflanzenbauwissenschaften, 17, pp. 395-6; Dorn, B., Musa, T., Krebs, H., Fried, P.M., Forrer, H.-R., Screening of plant extracts, micro-organisms and commercial preparations for biocontrol of Phytophthora infestans on detached potato leaves (2007) European Journal of Plant Pathology, 119, pp. 217-40; Filipinsky, M., (1989) Pflanzenaufnahme und Lösbarkeit Von Schwermetallen Aus Böden Hoher Geogener Anreicherung und Zusätzlicher Belastung [plant Uptake and Solubility of Heavy Metals from Soils of High Geogenic Concentrations and Additional Contamination]., , Göttingen, Germany: University of Göttingen, PhD thesis; Finckh, M.R., Wolfe, M.S., Diversification strategies (2006) The Epidemiology of Plant Disease, pp. 269-308. , In: Cooke, B.M., Gareth Jones, D., Kaye, B., eds. 2nd edn.

In addition, difficulties in marketing the produce are emphasised. The question thus arises if and how such strategies can be designed to find a place in modern agriculture. Considering the general ecological benefits of diversification and the possible economical benefits for growers and society, several possible approaches to the solution of actual and perceived problems in modern agriculture are discussed. An important route towards achieving diversity would be to integrate it into the breeding process. Selection criteria would include inducibility of resistance and competitive ability, in order to produce diversified varieties able to adapt both to unpredictable environmental conditions (especially climatic) and to changing pest and pathogen populations through co-evolution. Evolutionary breeding methods such as composite crosses and modern landraces and some of the legal problems associated with these approaches are discussed. Technical solutions are integral to the future use of diversification strategies and range from more or less simple adjustments to machinery for planting and harvesting to devices designed for separation of the harvested products. © 2008 KNPV.","Co-evolution; Composite crosses; Evolutionary breeding; Intercropping; Mixtures; Plant varietal protection","adaptation; coevolution; competitive ability; disease control; environmental conditions; pathogen; pest species; plant breeding",,,,,,"Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1961) Crop Science, 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., Genetic changes associated with the evolution of adaptedness in cultivated plants and their wild progenitors (1988) Journal of Heredity, 79, pp. 225-238; Altieri, M.A., (1995) Agroecology. the Science of Sustainable Agriculture, , Westview Press, IT Publications Boulder, Colorado, London; Altieri, M.A., Nicholls, C.I., Wolfe, M.S., Biodiversity - A central concept in organic agriculture: Restraining pests and diseases (1996) Fundamentals of Organic Agriculture, 1, pp. 91-112. , T.

The reasons for this shortfall are as under-investigated as is the genotype-specific response of this crop to phosphorus (P) application, which is critically low in many Myanmar soils, and the genetic variation in grain quality. For green gram quality, the concentration of lysine, an essential amino acid is particularly important given its scarcity in many cereal-based diets of Southeast Asia. The purpose of this study therefore was to investigate the effects of P application on the root and shoot growth, yield and its components for a range of green gram varieties, and to analyse the protein concentration and amino acid composition in green gram seed of different origins. To this end from 2001 to 2003, field experiments were conducted under rain-fed conditions in Yezin and Nyaung Oo. Fifteen landraces and five introduced green gram cultivars were grown at two levels of P (0 and 15 kg ha-1). There were large genotypic differences in P effects and a significant interaction between green gram genotypes and P for shoot and root growth. An unexpected benefit of P application was a reduction of pest and plant virus infestation in the field. Significant genotypic differences in the amino acid profile of seeds were also observed. The results indicate the potential for breeding efforts to increase seed yield and protein quality in green gram.","Landraces; Lysine; Mungbean; Protein quality","Vigna radiata; Vigna radiata var. radiata",,,,,,"ANISHETTY, N.M., MOSS, H., (1988) Vigna genetic resources: Current status and future plans; in: Mungbean: Proceedings of the Second International Symposium, pp. 13-18. , AVRDC, Shanhua, Taiwan;; ARAUJO, A.P., TEIXEIRA, M.G., Nitrogen and phosphorus harvest indices of common bean cultivars: Implications for yield quantity and quality (2003) Plant and Soil, 257, pp. 425-433; CHAHAL, R.S., VIRMANI, S.M., Preliminary study of the effect of time of application of Superphosphate on yield and nutrient uptake by groundnut (1973) Indian Journal of Agricultural Science, 43, pp. 731-733; COSTA, A.S., Whitefly-transmitted plant diseases (1976) Annual Review Phytopathology, 14, pp. 429-449; FAO, F.A.O., (1996) Agrostat Data Base, , Food and Agriculture Organization; Rome, Italy;; GOURLEY, C.J.P., ALLAN, D.L., RUSSSELE, M.P., Plant nutrient efficiency: A comparison of definitions and suggested improvement (1994) Plant and Soil, 158, pp. 29-37; GUNAWARDENA, S.F.B., DANSO, S.K.A., ZAPATA, F., Phosphorus requirements and N2 accumulation by three mungbean cultivars (1992) Plant and Soil, 147, pp. 267-274; JAMES, C., (1971) A manual of assessment keys for plant diseases, , Canada Department of Agriculture Publication No. 1458, APS Press;; JOOD, S., SINGH, M., Amino acid composition and biological evaluation of the protein quality of high lysine barley genotypes (2001) Plant Food and Human Nutrition, 56, pp. 145-155; LAWES AGRICULTURAL, T., (2000) GENSTAT 5, Release 4.2; Reference Manual, , Harpenden, Herts, UK; LAWN, R.J., AHN, C.S., Green gram (Vigna radiata L.)

Populations originating from fields with a history of potato cropping with only short or no rotation (old fields) were compared with populations from new fields, i.e., where no potatoes had been grown for at least 30 years and seed potatoes were either imported from breeders or produced on-farm (certified). The main goal was to determine the importance of seed potato infection in the establishment of new P. infestans populations. Isolates were characterized for mating type, virulences and rep- (repetitive extragenic palindromic) PCR fingerprints. Among a total of 639 isolates sampled from 31 sites, mating types A1 and A2 co-existed in all three years in 60-92% of the sites. Over all three years, 53 pathotypes were detected in a subsample of 272 isolates. Isolates originating from the new fields had significantly higher frequencies of the virulences v1, v2, v3, v6 and v7, indicating general effects of seed introduction into a new region. Thirty-six fingerprints were detected in a subsample of 281 isolates of which 22 were unique while four occurred in all three years and in many sites. Pathogen populations from potato fields that were grown from seed tubers of geographically different origin differed significantly based on χ 2 tests. While the Nei genetic distances were less than .1 among the local populations, distances to the US lineages US-1, US-6, US-7 and US-8 ranged from .22 to .47; however, the bootstrap values were not significant. Populations from old fields were more diverse and 14 of the 22 rep-PCR types occurred there among 132 isolates tested in comparison to six in the new fields (n = 140 isolates) and two among six isolates from volunteers. The results also suggest that both sexual and asexual reproduction play a role. © 2007 KNPV.","Diversity; Late blight; Pathotypes; Potato; Rep-PCR; Virulence","agricultural history; fungal disease; fungus; parasite infestation; pathotype; phenotype; phylogenetics; population structure; potato; virulence; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Hesse; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"Abu-El Samen, F.M., Secor, G.A., Gudmestad, N.C., Genetic variation among asexual progeny of Phytophthora infestans detected with RAPD and AFLP markers (2003) Plant Pathology, 52, pp. 314-325; Adler, N., (2001) Untersuchungen zum Befall von Kartoffel mit Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary mittels visueller Bonituren und PCR-Methoden, , PhD Thesis.

Both factors are limited by regulations that on the one hand prohibit the use of chemical fertilisers, especially nitrogen and, on the other hand, most synthetic pesticides. Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans is commonly thought to be the factor most limiting yield. However, because there is no really effective fungicide available to control late blight, there are virtually no yield loss data available for organic farming conditions. In this paper the state of the art of organic potato management with respect to disease and nutrient management is summarised. In a second part, the interactive effects of N-availability in the soil, climatic conditions and late blight were studied in the presence and absence of copper fungicides from 2002-2004 for the mid-early main-crop potato cv. Nicola. From the experimental work it became clear that copper fungicides in most cases do slow down epidemics adding an average of 3 days to the growth duration. However, only 30% of the variation in yield could be attributed to disease reduction. A model including disease reduction, growth duration and temperature sum from planting until 60% disease severity was reached, and soil mineral N contents at 10 days after emergence could explain 75% of the observed variation in yield. However, the model failed when N-supply was extremely high. The implications of the results on the management of organic potatoes with respect to cultivar choice, nutrient and disease management are discussed. In conclusion, several points emerge from the results: In organic farming, yields are foremost limited by nutrient availability in spring and early summer. The effects of late blight on yields may often be overestimated and cannot be deducted from results in conventional farming because of the strong interaction with nutrient status. Resistance clearly remains the most important strategy against late blight in organic potato production. However, as important or even more important than resistance is the early development and bulking behaviour and the ability of a cultivar to make use of organic nutrients efficiently. In the absence of efficient organic pesticides it is possible to reduce blight pressure to a certain extent by arranging the crop in small narrow fields perpendicular to the main wind direction neighboured either by non-hosts or completely resistant potatoes. © EAPR 2006.","Copper fungicides; Organic farming; Phytophthora infestans; Plant nutrition; Yield loss","Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"Alloway, B.J., (1995) Heavy Metals in Soils, 2nd Edn., , Blackie Academic and Professional, London; Andrivon, D., Lucas, J., Ellisseche, D., Development of natural late blight epidemics in pure and mixed plots of potato cultivars with different levels of partial resistance (2003) Plant Pathol, 52, pp. 586-594; Bouws-Beuermann, H., (2005) Effects of Strip Intercropping on Late Blight Severity, Yields of Potatoes (Solanum Tuberosum Lindl.) and on Population Structure of Phytophthora Infestans, , Dissertation, University of Kassel; Bruns, C., Finckh, M.R., Dlugowski, S., Leifert, C., Hospers, M., Interaction between soil fertility management and varity specific characteristics with the infestation of potatoes with Phytophthora infestans (2003) Ökologischer Landbau der Zukunft.

In order to determine the associated agronomic effects of straw mulch, applied at 2.5-5 t ha-1, on soil nitrate dynamics, weed development, tuber yield and soil erosion, 12 field experiments were evaluated. Experiments were conducted on organic farms over 3 years at two locations in a temperate climate (635-709 mm precipitation/year; 8.1°C mean air temperature) on loamy silt soils. Tuber yield and tuber size distribution were not influenced significantly by mulching. However, the risk of undesirable post harvest N-leaching was significantly reduced due to the immobilization of nitrate-N after harvest at 6.8-7.0 kg N t-1 straw in two experiments (18-34 kg NO3-N ha -1). There was no consistent effect of straw mulch on number of weeds, weed cover and above ground biomass of weeds. The fact that yield and weed development were not significantly affected by straw mulch is mainly attributed to the relatively low amounts of straw applied. Soil erosion was reduced by &gt;97% in a rain simulation experiment on a potato field of 8% slope with 20% crop cover. Soil loss was greatest (1606 g m-2) in the unmulched treatment, and 31, 42 and 26 g m-2 in treatments with chopped straw at 1.25, 2.5 and 5 t ha-1, respectively. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Farmers often plant mixtures of cassava cultivars, while bush-beans or maize are traditionally grown as cassava-intercrops. The objectives of this study were: (a) to determine if cassava or overall production can be improved by planting cassava cultivar mixtures or intercropping, (b) to assess the influence of soil properties on the dry matter production of cassava production systems, (c) to verify if soil cover can be increased by growing cultivar or species mixtures. On-farm trials were conducted at four locations in typical hillside environments with slopes up to 55% in the Southwest of Colombia from 1996 to 1998. Two cassava varieties contrasting in plant architecture (early branching variety, rich in apices versus erect, late branching variety, poor in apices) were grown as pure stands, as a variety mixture and each intercropped independently with upland rice or Canavalia brasiliensis. Rainfall during the trial period was only 76% of the long term average due to the 'El niño' phenomenon. The cassava cultivars produced tuber yields of 9.0 and 7.5 t ha -1 DM when planted in cultivar pure stands. Cassava growth and biomass production increased with increasing size of water stable aggregates and soil N content and decreased with increasing soil bulk density. In the cassava cultivar mixture, competition changed the pattern of biomass allocation, leading to a significantly lower harvest index compared to the mean of the pure stands (-6%). Intercropped C. brasiliensis significantly reduced cassava harvest index (-13%; mean of cassava/C. brasiliensis mixtures compared to mean of pure stands) as well as cassava (-53%) and total biomass production (-24%), while differences were not statistically significant in the cassava-rice systems probably because of the poor performance of rice. The strong reduction in cassava tuber yield in the cassava/C. brasiliensis systems was due to competition for water between cassava and the intercrop, aggravated by the lack of rain. The percentage of soil cover was slightly higher in all mixed cropping systems compared to the pure stands. In contrast to the mixture concept which seeks to increase productivity and soil cover compared to monocropping, the mixed cropping systems used in the studies in Rio Cabuyal reduced cassava tuber yield and total biomass production of the cropping systems compared to the cassava cultivar monocrops. When total soil cover was improved compared to the cassava cultivar pure stands it was paralleled by reductions in terms of cassava tuber yield. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Differential varieties were indica CO39, with five near-isogenic lines (NILs) for resistance genes in the genetic background of CO39, and japonica Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH), with five NILs for LTH. Twelve selected Bhutanese landraces also were studied. In addition, 10 blast nurseries consisting of the NIL sets, important local landraces, and representatives of international differential groups were established in the 1996 and 1997 growing seasons in the mid- and high-elevation agroecological zones. The 110 isolates were differentiated into 53 pathotypes based on the 2 NIL sets. Thirteen isolates were avirulent on all of the NILs but were compatible with some landraces. Several isolates were able to attack one of the NILs of CO39 but not CO39. These results strongly suggest that both CO39 and LTH possess previously unidentified resistance. The landraces were not uniform in their reactions to the isolates. When a reaction index taking into account all individual plant reactions was used, isolates that had been assigned to the same pathotype could be further differentiated, indicating that the NIL sets could not completely discriminate virulences in Bhutanese P. grisea populations. In the trap nurseries, disease was always present in the middle elevations, but disease was very low during July 1996 in the high elevations and only present during August and September 1997. Almost all varietal groups were more frequently attacked in the middle than in the high elevations, indicating that the virulence spectrum is wider and the conduciveness of the environment is greater in the middle elevations. Landraces from the high elevations were most susceptible, followed by international differential groups 7 and 8. The results suggest that selection has yielded landraces with more complete and complex resistance in the more disease-conducive mid-elevation environment. At the same time, the pathogen population also possesses a wider virulence spectrum in that environment.","Coevolution; Natural selection; Pyricularia oryzae; Traditional varieties; Virulence analysis","Bhutan; cultivar; environment; genetic selection; landrace; near isogenic line; rice blast; rice; virulence; Pyricularia grisea",,,,,,"Ahn, S.W., International collaboration on breeding for resistance to rice blast (1994) Rice Blast Disease, pp. 137-153. , R.

Rice Res. Inst., P.O. B., Manila, Philippines","In 1995, an unprecedented rice blast epidemic (caused by Pyricularia grisea) occurred in Bhutan in mostly traditional cultivars in the high (1800-2600 m) and some parts of mid altitude (1200-1800 m) agroecological zones. Possible causes of the outbreak such as introduction of a new pathogen race, unusual weather patterns and changes in agricultural practices were investigated and yield losses analyzed. Weather data were examined for unusual patterns and farmers from the affected areas were interviewed to determine possible changes of cultural practices. Blast isolates were collected from various affected rice areas and analyzed for variability of the pathogen population by MGR (Magnaporthe grisea repeat 586) fingerprinting. Rice yields declined parabolically with increasing disease with losses for some farmers being nearly 100%. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using MGR fingerprints of 71 isolates resulted in 58 haplotypes that grouped into 13 lineages. Lineage BhR1 and BhR4 were represented by 22 and 13 isolates, respectively, whereas the other lineages were represented by only one to six isolates each. Haplotypic diversity both in the early and late season's collections was very high suggesting that the blast epidemic was not caused by a new introduction or race change of the pathogen. There was no drastic shift in agricultural practices or rice cultivars which could explain the blast outbreak. However, the weather data indicated that the climatic conditions in 1995 favoured blast and these unusual conditions, in combination with the ubiquitous presence of the pathogen, probably account for the epidemic.

Indeed, one of the most powerful ways both to reduce the risk of resistance break-down and to still make use of defeated resistance genes is to use cereal variety and species mixtures. The most important mechanisms reducing disease in variety and species mixtures are barrier and frequency effects, and induced resistance. Differential adaptation, i.e. adaptation within races to specific host genotypic backgrounds, may prevent the rapid evolution of complex pathotypes in mixtures. Mixtures generally stabilise yields and yield losses due to disease; abiotic stresses are also better buffered than in pure stands. When mixture components are carefully put together, product quality can be enhanced or at least equal that of the pure stands. Mixture use in practice worldwide is reviewed.","Differential adaptation; Evolutionary plant breeding; Functional diversity; Induced resistance; Yield stability","cereal grain; genetic improvement; mixture; pathotype; plant breeding; plant disease control; agricultural practice; disease control; disease resistance",,,,,,"Akanda, S.I., Mundt, C.C., Effects of two-component wheat cultivar mixtures on stripe rust severity (1996) Phytopathology, 86, pp. 347-353; Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1960) Crop Sci., 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., The genetics of host-pathogen coevolution: Implications for genetic resource conservation (1990) Heredity, 81, pp. 1-6; Allard, R.W., Adams, J., Population studies in predominantly self-pollinating species XIII Intergenotypic competition and population structure in barley and wheat (1969) Amer.

In the addition series, plant densities in pure stands of three cultivars, Rambo, Rodos and Grosso (susceptible, moderately resistant and immune, respectively) were varied six-fold. In the replacement series, the three possible two-way mixtures were analysed at different frequencies but at a density corresponding to the maximum pure stand density. Disease and yield were assessed off a per-plant basis. In the pure stands, tillering reduced the range of densities from six-fold to between three- and four-fold, while in the mixtures, frequencies changed only slightly over time, indicating that competitive interactions among the cultivars were roughly equal. Yield per plant decreased logarithmically with increasing density as expected. However, yield per seed head was not correlated with the final number of heads per plot, indicating low competition among heads even at the highest density. Disease in susceptible pure stands increased strongly with decreasing density in 1994 and to a lesser degree in 1995. These differences could have been caused by differences in plant nutritional status and consequent epidemiological effects. Disease reduction on the susceptible cultivars in mixtures varied between 33% and 71% among years. Depending on the length and strength of the epidemic, the effects of host density and frequency on disease severity varied substantially among years.","Barley; Cultivar mixtures; Density effects; Disease control; Frequency effects; Powdery mildew","barley; competition; cultivar; plant nutrition; plant pathology; planting density; powdery mildew; tillering; disease vector; fungal disease; survival",,,,,,"Akanda, S.I., Mundt, C.C., Effects of two-component cultivar mixtures and yellow rust on yield and yield components of wheat (1996) Phytopathology, 86, pp. 347-353; Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1960) Crop Science, 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., Adams, J., Population studies in predominantly self-pollinating species XIII: Intergenotypic competition and population structure in barley and wheat (1969) American Naturalist, 103, pp. 620-645; Blijenburg, J.G., Sneep, J., Natural selection in a mixture of eight barley varieties grown in six successive years 1: Competition between the varieties (1975) Euphytica, 24, pp. 305-315; Browning, J.A., A unifying theory of the genetic protection of crop plant populations from diseases (1997) Disease Resistance from Crop Progenitors and Other Wild Relatives, , Wahl I, Fischbeck G, Browning JA, eds, Springer Verlag, in press; Burdon, J.J., Chilvers, G.A., Controlled environment experiments on epidemics of barley mildew in different density host stands (1976) Oecologia, 26, pp. 61-72; Burdon, J.J., Chilvers, G.A., Host density as a factor in disease ecology (1982) Annual Review of Plant Pathology, 20, pp. 143-166; Calonnec, A., Goyeau, H., De Vallavieille-Pope, C., Effects of induced resistance on infection efficiency and sporulation of Puccinia striiformis on seedlings in varietal mixtures and on field epidemics in pure stands (1996) European Journal of Plant Pathology, 102, pp. 733-741; Chin, K.M., Wolfe, M.S., Minchin, P.N., Host-mediated interactions between pathogen genotypes (1984) Plant Pathology, 33, pp. 161-171; Czembor, H.J., Gacek, E.S., The use of cultivar and species mixtures to control diseases and for yield improvement in cereals in Poland (1496) Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Integrated Control of Cereal Mildews Across Europe, November 5-10 1994, Kappel A.

One of these, Race 3, was found to consist of two phylogenetically distinct lineages based on DNA fingerprinting analysis. To determine, if the two lineages could be differentiated based on host-specificity, 186 strains of Race 3 were analyzed with additional fingerprints and 76 selected isolates with additional differential rice varieties. The strains were separated into 36 haplotypes clustering in three groups (IS1113-B, -C, and -G) at the 75% similarity level. Isolates varied in their reaction to a rice line carrying the resistance gene Xa7, however, the variability was not consistent within lineage. Aggressiveness of isolates belonging to lineage IS1113-B and -G was significantly greater when tested during the dry season than when tested during the wet season. However, no such differences were evident for isolates from lineage IS1113-C, indicating that environmental effects presumably light and temperature are genotype-specific.","Environmental effects; Phylogeny; pv. oryzae; Rice; Rice bacterial blight; Virulence analysis; Xanthomonas oryzae","bacterial infection; DNA fingerprinting; environment; haplotype; light; phenotype; Philippines; phylogeny; plant pathology; plant variety; race; resistance gene; temperature; virulence; Xanthomonas oryzae",,,,,,"Ardales, E.Y., Leung, H., Vera Cruz, C.M., Mew, T.W., Leach, J.E., Nelson, R.J., Hierarchical analysis of spatial variation of the rice bacterial blight pathogen across diverse agroecosystems in the Philippines (1996) Phytopathology, 86, pp. 241-252; Caten, C.E., The concept of race in plant pathology (1987) Populations of Plant Pathogens: Their Dynamics and Genetics, pp. 21-37. , Wolfe MS and Caten CE (eds) Blackwell Scientific Publ., Oxford; Felsenstein, J., Confidence limits on phylogenies: An approach using the bootstrap (1985) Evolution, 39, pp. 783-791; Felsenstein, J., Phylogenies from molecular sequences: Inference and reliability (1988) Annual Review of Genetics, 22, pp. 521-565; Fry, W.E., Goodwin, S.B., Resurgence of the Irish potato famine fungus (1997) Bioscience, 47, pp. 363-371; George, M.L.C., Bustamam, M., Cruz, W.T., Leach, J.E., Nelson, R.J., Movement of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in Southeast Asia detected using PCR-based DNA fingerprinting (1997) Phytopathology, 87, pp. 302-309; Hopkins, C.M., White, F.F., Choi, S.H., Guo, A.L., Identification of a family of airvalence genes from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (1992) Mol.

Plants within individual hills of rice were inoculated, and the number of new lesions in the primary generation of dispersal from these inoculated sources was counted. Two dispersal models that can describe the number of infections at the source (the Kiyosawa and Shiyomi and the modified Gregory) were fit to the lesion counts. Estimated gradient slopes were similar in the 2 years of the study for both gradient models. However, the Kiyosawa and Shiyomi model gave a better fit in both years, as indicated by higher coefficients of determination and significances of slopes and by a more random pattern of residuals. Primary disease gradients were very steep, with half-distances (distances over which lesion numbers are calculated to decrease by half) estimated from the Kiyosawa and Shiyomi model of 0.091 and 0.081 m in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Splash dispersal of X. oryzae pv. oryzae is the most likely explanation for both the steep slopes measured and the superior fit of the Kiyosawa and Shiyomi model over the modified Gregory model.",,"bacterial blight; disease model; gregory model; kiyosawa model; shiyomi model; Oryza sativa; Xanthomonas oryzae",,,,,,"Ahmed, H.U., Finckh, M.R., Alfonso, R.F., Mundt, C.C., Epidemiological effect of gene deployment strategies on bacterial blight of rice (1997) Phytopathology, 87, pp. 66-70; Alvarez, A.M., Teng, P.S., Benedict, A.A., Methods for epidemiological research on bacterial blight of rice (1989) Bacterial Blight of Rice, pp. 65-78. , International Rice Research Institute, Manila, Philippines; Aylor, D.E., Dispersal in time and space: Aerial pathogens (1978) Plant Disease: An Advanced Treatise, 2, pp. 159-180. , J.

Nine rice populations were studied including pure stands, two-component mixtures, two-gene combinations of backcrossed lines containing varying combinations of the bacterial blight resistance genes Xa-4, xa-5, and Xa-10, and a non-isogenic cultivar containing Xa-4 and partial resistance to bacterial blight. The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) of both gene combinations studied was significantly less than the single most effective gene of each combination deployed singly. A mixture of a susceptible and a resistant line expressed an AUDPC significantly less than the mean of its component pure stands, but two other mixtures did not. The cultivar IR20, which contains both Xa-4 and partial resistance, reduced the AUDPC by about two-thirds as compared with IR-BB4, which contains Xa-4 and little or no partial resistance.","Oryza sativa; Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae",,,,,,,"Adhikari, T.B., Vera Cruz, C.M., Zhang, Q., Nelson, R.J., Skinner, D.Z., Mew, T.W., Leach, J.E., Genetic diversity of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in Asia (1995) Appl.

Effects of disease and environment on competitive interactions among wheat genotypes were investigated. Five wheat genotypes were grown in up to six different two-way combinations and as pure stands in two or three locations during one to three growing seasons in the presence and absence of wheat stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis). 2. Overall yield of the mixtures relative to the means of the monocultures did not differ among locations and years. However, interactions between genotypes were often affected by location and to a lesser degree by year. Disease significantly affected seed weight and seed number of the two susceptible genotypes in pure stands and in mixtures. Disease also led to changes in competitive interactions between resistant and susceptible genotypes. 3. Competitive interactions among genotypes often changed from early in the season (as measured by the number of tillers) to late in the season (as measured by yield per tiller). In a few mixtures negative correlations between curly competitive ability (relative number of tillers) and components of late competition suggested that intragenotypic competition might have been stronger than inter-genotypic competition.","location effects; plant disease; Puccinia striiformis; Triticum aestivum; year effects","competition; stripe rust; wheat; Poaceae; Puccinia striiformis; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Alexander, H.M., Roelfs, A.P., Cobbs, G., Effects of disease and plant competition in monocultures and mixtures of two wheat cultivars (1986) Plant Pathology, 35, pp. 457-465; Allard, R.W., Adams, J., Population studies in predominantly self-pollinating species XIII.

The rice cultivars were irradiated with UV-B 313 lamps that were either filtered with cellulose acetate of 0.13 mm thickness (light transmission greater than 290 nm) or with Mylar D of 0.13 mm thickness (light transmission greater than 320 nm). Irradiation was for 6 h daily for 21 days starting at 9 days after planting. After irradiation, plants were inoculated with one or two blast isolates. In 18 out of 36 measured interactions the number of lesions per plant was higher in the presence of UV-B than in its absence. However, only two interactions were statistically significant. In a second experiment the dose-response relationship between the cultivars IR30 and IR72 and UV-B was established in the presence and absence of disease. Increasing levels of UV-B significantly reduced leaf areas, dry weights, and heights of both cultivars. Disease severity was either unaffected or decreased by UV-B. However, disease significantly changed the effects of UV-B on plant growth and recovery from UV-B damage. IR30 but not IR72 recovered from UV-B damage in the absence of disease within 5 days. No recovery occurred when inoculated. IR72 suffered even greater reductions of leaf area and dry weight by UV-B when inoculated. Although the effects of UV-B on disease severity may be small, it appears that the tolerance of plants to disease is decreased by UV-B radiation. © 1995.","Oryza sativa; Pyricularia grisea; stratospheric ozone depletion; UV-B radiation","Oryza sativa",,,,,,"Bachelet, Barnes, Brown, Brown, Latitudinal and seasonal variation in calculated ultraviolet-B irradiance in rice-growing regions of Asia (1991) Photochemistry and Photobiology, 54, pp. 411-422; Barnes, Jordan, Gold, Flint, Caldwell, Competition, morphology and canopy structure in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and wild oat (Avena fatua L.) exposed to enhanced ultraviolet-B radiation (1988) Functional Ecol., 2, pp. 319-330; Barnes, Flint, Caldwell, Morphological responses of crop and weed species of different growth forms to ultraviolet-B radiation (1990) Am.

In addition, pure stands of the four varieties were grown in each year. Populations were either exposed to two stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) races, protected from stripe rust, or exposed to alternating years of diseased and disease-free conditions. Regression of the logit of a variety's frequency versus generation number was used to calculate the relative fitness of each variety in each population. These analyses suggest that the relative fitnesses of the wheat varieties were affected by disease and geographic location and were constant over time. However, frequency-changes of varieties in the mixtures were negatively correlated with their planting frequencies (0.0001 < P < 0.085 in 14 out of 16 cases), suggesting that fitnesses were frequency-dependent in both the presence and absence of disease. We hypothesize that failure to detect frequency-dependence of fitness in the logit analyses was due to a limited number of generations and a limited range of initial variety frequencies. This is supported by data from longer-term studies in the literature that provide evidence for frequency-dependence of fitness in plant mixtures. Analyses of currently available field data suggest that stable equilibria may be a more likely outcome for mixtures of varieties that are more closely related and/or more uniformly adapted to the environment in which they are grown. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Equilibrium frequencies; Evolution; Frequency-dependence; Host diversity; Pathogens",,,,,,,"Alexander, H.M., Spatial patterns of disease induced by Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans in a population of Plantago lanceolata (1984) Oecologia, 62, pp. 141-143; Alexander, H.M., Plant population heterogeneity and pathogen and herbivore levels: a field experiment (1991) Oecologia, 86, pp. 125-131; Alexander, H.M., Burdon, J.J., The effect of disease induced by Albugo Candida (white rust) and Peronospora parasitica on the survival and reproduction of capsella bursa-pastoris (1984) Oecologia, 64, pp. 314-318; Alexander, H.M., Roelfs, A.P., Cobbs, G., Effects of disease and plant competition in monocultures and mixtures of two wheat cultivars (1986) Plant Pathology, 35, pp. 457-465; Augspurger, C.K., Seedling survival of tropical tree species: Interactions of dispersal distance, light-gaps, and pathogens (1984) Ecology, 65, pp. 1705-1712; Augspurger, C.K., Kelly, C.K., Pathogen mortality of tropical tree seedlings.

Replacement series consisting of a susceptible and a resistant wheat genotype or two wheat genotypes susceptible to different races of stripe rust were grown in the presence and absence of the pathogen. Stripe rust severity, number of seed heads, seed yield, and seed weight were determined separately for each wheat genotype in the mixtures and the pure stands. The frequency of susceptible genotypes in a mixture explained up to 67% of the variation in disease severity. However, competitive interactions among plant genotypes sometimes appeared to alter susceptibility and obscured the relationship. In pure stands of single genotypes, disease severity explained between 52 and 58% of the variation in seed yield. In mixtures, coefficients of determination were only 10 and 31%, suggesting a strong influence of plant-plant interactions on seed yield. These results suggest that host-parasite coevolutionary models need to account for the strong effect that specific plant genotype combinations may have on disease severity and plant reproduction. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Frequency-dependence; Genetic diversity; Plant disease; Puccinia striiformis; Triticum aestivum","genetic diversity; rust; stripe rust; wheat; Puccinia striiformis; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Alexander, H.M., Spatial patterns of disease induced by Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans in a population of Plantago lanceolata (1984) Oecologia, 62, pp. 141-143; Alexander, H.M., Spatial heterogeneity and disease in natural populations (1988) Spatial Components of Epidemics, pp. 144-164. , M.J., Jeger, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Alexander, H.M., Plant population heterogeneity and pathogen and herbivore levels: a field experiment (1991) Oecologia, 86, pp. 125-131; Alexander, H.M., Burdon, J.J., The effect of disease induced by Albugo candida (white rust) and Peronospora parasitica on the survival and reproduction of Capsella bursa-pastoris (1984) Oecologia, 64, pp. 314-318; Alexander, H.M., Roelfs, A.P., Cobbs, G., Effects of disease and plant competition in monocultures and mixtures of two wheat cultivars (1986) Plant Pathology, 35, pp. 457-465; Augspurger, C.K., Seedling survival of tropical tree species: Interactions of dispersal distance, light-gaps, and pathogens (1984) Ecology, 65, pp. 1705-1712; Augspurger, C.K., Kelly, C.K., Pathogen mortality of tropical tree seedlings.
