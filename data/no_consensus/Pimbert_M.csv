Their integration has provided a collective-action mode for contesting the dominant agro-food regime and creating alternatives, especially through a linkage with food sovereignty. At the same time, agroecology has been recently adopted by some actors who also promote conventional agriculture. Agroecology can play different roles—either conforming to the dominant regime, or else helping to transform it—contingent on specific empowerment strategies. Tensions between “conform versus transform” roles can be identified in European agroecological research, especially in three areas: farm-level agroecosystems development; participatory plant breeding; and short food-supply chains remunerating agroecological methods. To play a transformative role, collaborative strategies need to go beyond the linear stereotype whereby scientists “transfer” technology or farmers “apply” scientific research results. To the extent that farmer–scientist alliances co-create and exchange knowledge, such gains can transform the research system. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","agrarian-based rural development; agroecology; farmer participation; knowledge exchange; research; transformation",,,,,,,"Altieri, M.A., (1995) Agroecology: The science of sustainable agriculture, , 2nd ed., Boulder, CO: Westview Press; (2012), http://agro-ecoinnovation.eu/toolbox/july-2012-workshop-materials/, ARC2020, IFOAM EU, and TP Organics, Agro-ecological innovation project: Progress and Recommendations, Agricultural & Rural Convention 2020, International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, Technology Platform OrganicsBacon, C., DeVuono-Powell, S., Frampton, M.L., LoPresti, T., Pannu, C., Introduction to empowered partnerships: community-based participatory action research for environmental justice (2013) Environmental Justice, 6 (1), pp. 1-8; (2014), http://www.societadeiterritorialisti.it/index.php, Bocci, R, Seeds between freedom and rights, Scienze del Territorio 2, 115–122Bocci, R., Chable, V., Kastler, G., Louwaars, N., Farm seed opportunities: Recommendations for on-farm conservation in Europe (2011) Agrobiodiversity conservation: Securing the diversity of crop wild relatives and landraces, , Maxted N., Dulloo E., Ford-Lloyd B.

Participatory Rural Appraisals (PRAs) reveal that strict restrictions on the use of protected area resources by local communities, such as the banning of grazing in Keoladeo, were ecologically unsound as well as a threat to local livelihoods. Both PRAs have proved successful in terms of clarifying issues and in promoting experiential learning, yet to date have not demonstrated significant influence on changes at local or higher policy levels. Ultimately, such exercises should not be judged on their ability to remedy poorly designed and insensitive protected area schemes. Instead, it is their ability to address the underlying needs of local people, namely their opposition to existing unequal and in some instances illegitimate access to resources. It is these inequities that perpetuate the conflicts which the proposed joint management schemes attempt to mediate. The greatest challenge for policy-makers is for PRAs to be conducted with local communities before protected areas are formally established. Such measures would encourage joint management, reduce potential conflict, and promote ecologically sound practice.",,"park-people relations; participatory rural appraisal; protected area; wetland management; India; Pakistan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031420594

In the past, many ""primary' forests or habitats supported large numbers of people, who significantly influenced current ecosystems. The paper asserts that it is necessary to find ways of ensuring local communities' full participation in conservation programmes and policy. Alternative systems of learning and interaction have the potential to contribute to more sustainable management of protected areas. The paper concludes that, for this vision to succeed, a ""new professionalism' is required, as well as supportive national and international policies.

Many countries have more than 10% of their area set aside for conservation purposes. But this increase in designated conservation has been accompanied by a strong ideology that people are bad for natural resources. Policies and practice have, therefore, both encouraged exclusion and discouraged local participation. As a result, social conflicts have grown in and around protected areas, and conservation goals themselves have been threatened. Conservation science itself needs rethinking. It has been dominated by the positivist and rationalist paradigm, in which professionals assume they know best and so can analyse and influence natural resources in the ways they desire. But if natural resources are to be conserved, then the skills, knowledge and needs of local people will have to be built upon.

Onset of sexual maturity and the production/release of the female sex pheromone is either induced (diapausing B. atrolineatus, flight forms of C. maculatus) or speeded up (Z. subfasciatus) (""primer' effect). Adults only reach sexual maturity when the host plants are, or are about to be, at the phenological stage required for new born larvae. Until that time, the food stored during larval development is not used up prematurely in oogenesis or male accessory gland growth, thus contributing to adult survival during the unfavourable season. -from Authors",,"host plant; pheromone; sexual maturity; Bruchidae; Bruchidius atrolineatus; Callosobruchus maculatus; Zabrotes subfasciatus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024903067

Virgin female insects used in experiments were of different ages and given seeds, or not, of the host plant, Phaseolus vulgaris L. The odours of females which did not get host plant seeds, do not elicit EAG responses in virgin males, until they are at least 6 days old. On the other hand, the release of the sex pheromone as perceived by the male antennae, occurs earlier in the life of females when they are in contact with the host plant's seeds. This suggests that the sexual attractiveness of the females of this specialist insect is probably closely correlated with vitellogenesis. The latter is indeed highly dependent on host plant stimulation. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Bruchidae; electroantennograms; host plant; reproductive regulation; sex pheromone",,,,,,,,"Pimbert, M.; Institut de Biocénotique Expérimentale des Agrosystèmes, Université F.

The attractiveness of male and female odours were therefore studied and compared in an olfactometer. The behaviour of virgin and inseminated females and males, left in contact with the host plant's seeds or not, was studied in terms of the age of the imagos. In all cases examined, male odours did not attract female insects. Virgin females kept without seeds of the host plant did not attract males. On the other hand, the odour of virgin females left in contact with bean seeds significantly attracted virgin males. The females' attractive power varied according to their age: older females released a chemical cue that was more attractive for the males. Emission of the sex-pheromone stops after insemination of the females but begins again after a certain period of time. Results are discussed in terms of what is known on the reproductive regulation of this bruchid. © 1987 Dr W.

The first was harvested on the insect's wild host plant, Phaseolus lunatus L. The second was collected on a cultivated host plant, P. vulgaris L. Within each of the two insect stocks, fecundities and ovarian productions were similar whether females were offered seeds of the host plant on which they completed their larval development or an alternative host. When given the choice of host plants, females of both stockś oviposited preferentially on P. vulgaris. The substrate used for larval development did not influence the choice of subsequent oviposition sites. There appears to be no behavioural or physiological barriers preventing a single population of Z. subfasciatus from reproducing on both wild and cultivated host plants where they grow together. © 1985 Dr W.

Fecundities of females in the presence of pods were low. The influence of bean seeds on female reproductive activity was more pronounced than that of pods. Contact with seeds led to a marked increase in the number of sexual meetings, ovarian production and egg-laying activity. Under these conditions, eggs are laid directly on the larvae's food. Insemination alone stimulated oogenesis but did not induce egg-laying. Possible additive or synergistic interactions between host plant information perceived by females, the effects of egg-laying and insemination are suggested to explain the observed results. -from Authors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03076946,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021029596
