The meeting was science-based but policy-oriented. The role and amount of healthy and unhealthy fats, with attention to the relative content of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, sugar, and particularly fructose in foods that may underlie the epidemics of non-communicable diseases (NCD's) worldwide were extensively discussed. The report concludes that sugar consumption, especially in the form of high energy fructose in soft drinks, poses a major and insidious health threat, especially in children, and most diets, although with regional differences, are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids and too high in omega-6 fatty acids. Gene-nutrient interactions in growth and development and in disease prevention are fundamental to health, therefore regional Centers on Genetics, Nutrition and Fitness for Health should be established worldwide. Heads of state and government must elevate, as a matter of urgency, Nutrition as a national priority, that access to a healthy diet should be considered a human right and that the lead responsibility for Nutrition should be placed in Ministries of Health rather than agriculture so that the health requirements drive agricultural priorities, not vice versa. Nutritional security should be given the same priority as food security.","Fructose; Gen-nutrient interactions; Non-communicable diseases; Nutrition policy; Nutrition security; Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids",,,,,,,"Simopoulos, A.P., (2011) Healthy Agriculture, Healthy Nutrition, 102. , Healthy People; World Review of Nutrition and Dietetics, Karger: Basel, Switzerland; Simopoulos, A.P., Faergeman, O., Bourne, P.G., Action Plan for a Healthy Agriculture, Healthy Nutrition, Healthy People (2011) J Nutrigenet Nutrigenomics, 4, pp. 65-82; Simopoulos, A.P., The importance of the omega-6/omega-3 Fatty Acid ratio in cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases (2008) Exp Biol Med (Maywood), 233, pp. 674-688; Simopoulos, A.P., (2009) Omega-6/Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids: Biological Effects.

This post-hoc analysis of the IDEAL study compared intensive versus moderate statin therapy for the prevention of CV events in coronary heart disease patients with normal and elevated baseline levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Methods Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the effect of atorvastatin 80 mg/day versus simvastatin 20-40 mg/day on the risk of IDEAL study end points in patients with normal baseline ALT (defined as ALT < ULN [upper limit of normal]) versus elevated baseline ALT (ALT ≥ ULN). Results Of 8863 IDEAL patients with non-missing baseline ALT values, 7782 (87.8%) had an ALT < ULN and 1081 (12.2%) had an ALT ≥ ULN. In patients with elevated baseline ALT, major CV event rates were 11.5% for simvastatin and 6.5% for atorvastatin, indicating a significant risk reduction with intensive statin therapy (hazard ratio, 0.556; 95% confidence interval, 0.367-0.842; p = 0.0056). Significant heterogeneity of treatment effect was observed for major CV events, cerebrovascular events, and major coronary events, with a trend towards treatment difference for the other outcomes, indicating a greater benefit with atorvastatin in the elevated ALT group. Conclusions The CV benefit of intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin compared with a more moderate regimen with simvastatin was generally greater in patients with mildly-to-moderately elevated baseline ALT than patients with normal baseline ALT. Moderate elevations in liver enzyme levels should not present a barrier to prescribing statins, even at higher doses, in high-risk patients. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Alanine aminotransferase; Cardiovascular risk; Coronary heart disease; Fatty liver disease; Liver enzymes; Statins","acetylsalicylic acid; alanine aminotransferase; angiotensin receptor antagonist; atorvastatin; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium antagonist; dicoumarol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; pravastatin; simvastatin; warfarin; alanine aminotransferase; atorvastatin; biological marker; heptanoic acid derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hypocholesterolemic agent; pyrrole derivative; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular effect; comparative study; congestive heart failure; controlled study; coronary artery disease; disease severity; drug effect; drug efficacy; female; human; hypertransaminasemia; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; open study; post hoc analysis; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; risk reduction; secondary prevention; treatment outcome; blood; Coronary Disease; middle aged; single blind procedure; Aged; Alanine Transaminase; Anticholesteremic Agents; Biological Markers; Coronary Disease; Female; Heptanoic Acids; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Pyrroles; Single-Blind Method; Treatment Outcome",,"acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; dicoumarol, 66-76-2; pravastatin, 81093-37-0, 81131-70-6; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; warfarin, 129-06-6, 2610-86-8, 3324-63-8, 5543-58-8, 81-81-2; alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; Alanine Transaminase; Anticholesteremic Agents; atorvastatin; Biological Markers; Heptanoic Acids; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Pyrroles",,,,"Expert Panel on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults.

The meeting focused on evolutionary aspects of human diet through the life cycle in terms of genetic predisposition, overall health, prevention of disease and of unhealthy behaviors, such as poor physical activity, and dietary changes caused by the introduction of modern agriculture, from the Agribusiness to systems of food production, from climate changes to the needs imposed by urban agriculture and architecture. Nutritional medical (mostly cardiological) and political aspects of disease prevention through healthy dietary habits and physical activity have always been seen in isolation. The meeting, the first of its kind, treated such aspects together, recognizing the importance of integrating and initiating a dialogue between these disciplines. The meeting gathered together experts in cardiovascular prevention, nutrition, as well as politicians, for a global discussion of these themes. A summary statement was then compiled, focusing on the main themes on which a consensus had been reached. I strongly believe that such themes have great relevance for public health, raising the need for disseminating them as widely as possible. I am thankful to the Editor of the Italian Journal of Medicine for allowing this summary document to be made available for the first time in Italy. ©Copyright A.P.

The meeting was science-based but policy-oriented. The role and amount of healthy and unhealthy fats, with attention to the relative content of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, sugar, and particularly fructose in foods that may underlie the epidemics of non-communicable diseases (NCD's) worldwide were extensively discussed. The report concludes that sugar consumption, especially in the form of high energy fructose in soft drinks, poses a major and insidious health threat, especially in children, and most diets, although with regional differences, are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids and too high in omega-6 fatty acids. Gene-nutrient interactions in growth and development and in disease prevention are fundamental to health, therefore regional Centers on Genetics, Nutrition and Fitness for Health should be established worldwide. Heads of state and government must elevate, as a matter of urgency, Nutrition as a national priority, that access to a healthy diet should be considered a human right and that the lead responsibility for Nutrition should be placed in Ministries of Health rather than agriculture so that the health requirements drive agricultural priorities, not vice versa. Nutritional security should be given the same priority as food security. © 2013 Artemis P.

Objectives: We studied the association between AF and upper limb thromboembolectomy involving brachial, ulnar or radial artery in a national cohort study that included all individuals aged 40-99years with incident AF. Methods: Data were retrieved from the Danish National Vascular Registry, the National Registry of Patients, the Danish Civil Registration System and Statistics Denmark. Results: In total, 131476 patients (68042 men and 63434 women) with AF without previous thromboembolectomy in the upper limb were registered. In the study cohort, 130 men underwent upper limb thromboembolectomy over 220890 person-years of observation, whilst 275 women underwent thromboembolectomy over 197777 patient-years. The incidence per 100000 person-years was 58.9 (95% CI, 49.2-69.8) for men and 139.1 (95% CI, 123.1-156.5) for women. The relative risk of thromboembolectomy among patients with AF compared to the background population was 7.5 (95% CI, 6.3-8.9) for men, and 9.3 (95% CI, 8.3-10.5) for women. Women with AF had a relative thromboembolectomy risk of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.5-2.3) compared to men with AF. Among patients with AF, history of hypertension (HR 2.2-2.9), myocardial infarction (HR 2.9-3.9), heart failure (HR 1.6-1.9) and stroke (HR 2.2-3.8) were significantly associated with increased risk of thromboembolectomy in both men and women. Conclusions: AF substantially increases the risk of upper limb thromboembolectomy. This risk is higher with increasing age, female gender, and associated with hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. © 2011 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.","Atrial fibrillation; Epidemiology; Thromboembolectomy; Upper limb","adult; aged; article; brachial artery; cohort analysis; disease association; female; heart atrium fibrillation; heart failure; heart infarction; human; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; priority journal; radial artery; sex difference; stroke; surgical thrombectomy; thromboembolism; ulnar artery; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arm; Atrial Fibrillation; Brachial Artery; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Embolectomy; Embolism; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Radial Artery; Registries; Risk Factors; Stroke; Thrombectomy; Ulnar Artery",,,,,,"Boysen, G., Nyboe, J., Appleyard, M., Boas, J., Somnier, F., Jensen, G., Schnohr, P., Stroke incidence and risk factors for stroke in Copenhagen, Denmark (1988) Stroke, 19, pp. 1345-1353; Frost, L., Engholm, G., Johnsen, S., Moller, H., Husted, S., Incident stroke after discharge from the hospital with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (2000) Am J Med, 108, pp. 36-40; Wolf, P.A., Abbott, R.D., Kannel, W.B., Atrial fibrillation as an independent risk factor for stroke: the Framingham Study (1991) Stroke, 22, pp. 983-988; Wolf, P.A., Mitchell, J.B., Baker, C.S., Kannel, W.B., D'Agostino, R.B., Impact of atrial fibrillation on mortality, stroke, and medical costs (1998) Arch Intern Med, 158, pp. 229-234; Stroke, R., Independent predictors of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review (2007) Neurology, 69, pp. 546-554; Takolander, R., Swedenborg, J., Acute nontraumatic extremity ischemia.

We explored how lipoprotein components related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in these groups. Methods and results: For subjects who reached on-treatment LDL-C goals, Cox regression models were used to assess the ability of lipoprotein components to predict CVD events. Treatment with simvastatin or atorvastatin resulted in 40 per cent and 80 per cent of patients, respectively, reaching the 2.5 mmol/l goal and 12 per cent and 52 per cent, respectively, reaching the 2.0 mmol/l goal, after 1 year (all p < 0.001 between groups). Adjusting for baseline LDL-C levels, hazard ratio (HR) for those reaching 2.0-2.5 mmol/l LDL-C versus those reaching <2.0 mmol/l was 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.33, p=0.023). An increase of the apolipoprotein B/A1 (apoB/A1) ratio by 1 standard deviation in participants who reached 2.0 mmol/l showed a HR for CVD of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.04-1.25, p=0.004). Conclusion: More CVD patients treated with atorvastatin than simvastatin achieved either LDL-C goal and those reaching the 2.0 mmol/l goal exhibited significantly less CVD than those only reaching 2.5 mmol/l. In those reaching the 2.0 mmol/l goal, the apoB/A1 ratio still bears a relation to CVD outcome. The use of apoB/A1 ratio may provide additional predictive value to that of LDL-C. © The European Society of Cardiology 2011.","Apolipoprotein; Atorvastatin; Coronary heart disease; Lipoproteins; Prevention;

Methods: We performed a national cohort study of individuals, aged 40-99 years, and undergoing first-time thrombo-embolectomy in the brachial, ulnar or radial artery in Denmark from 1990 to 2002. The data were retrieved from the National Vascular Registry and from the National Registry of Patients and the Civil Registration System. Patients were followed until 2006 to ascertain the occurrence of amputation and stroke and until 2007 with respect to death. Results: In total, 1377 incident cases of thrombo-embolectomy were registered, comprising 504 (36.6%) males with a mean age of 72.0 (standard deviation (SD) 12.4) years and 873 (63.4%) females with a mean age of 77.2 (SD 11.7) years. Incidence was 3.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1-3.7) for males and 5.2 (95% CI: 4.9-5.6) for females per 100000 person-years. After thrombo-embolectomy, upper-limb amputation was performed in 11 (incidence 2.2%; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4) males and 31 (3.6%; 95% CI: 2.5-4.9) females. Age- and sex-specific risk of stroke was 2-16 times higher, and risk of death 3-11 times higher, than in the general population. Conclusions: Upper-limb thrombo-embolectomy is associated with an increased risk of limb amputation, stroke and death. © 2010 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether efficacy and safety of intensive statin therapy in patients with a recent cardiac event are maintained in longer-term follow-up has not been evaluated. We conducted a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of 999 patients who had a first acute myocardial infarction (MI) <2 months before randomization in a prospective, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial of 8,888 patients with a history of MI that compared intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg) to standard statin therapy (simvastatin 20 to 40 mg) over approximately 5 years of follow-up. We analyzed the same composite end point used in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE IT) trial (death, MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, revascularization, and stroke). Rates of the composite end point were 44.7% (n = 226) in the simvastatin group and 37.9% (n = 187) in the atorvastatin group (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.99, p = 0.04). Although statistical power was smaller than that of the PROVE IT trial, the relative risk decrease observed at 5 years is consistent with that in the 2-year follow-up in PROVE IT. The 2 treatment regimens were well tolerated. In conclusion, our analysis provides support for the strategy of placing patients with recent MI on intensive statin therapy and maintaining the high dose over the long term, beyond 2 years. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,"atorvastatin; creatine kinase; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; simvastatin; acute heart infarction; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; heart arrest; heart death; human; major clinical study; male; myopathy; patient compliance; post hoc analysis; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rhabdomyolysis; unspecified side effect; Aged; Denmark; Female; Finland; Heptanoic Acids; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Netherlands; Norway; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Pyrroles; Recurrence; Simvastatin; Sweden; Treatment Outcome",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Heptanoic Acids; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lipids; Pyrroles; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9; atorvastatin, 110862-48-1",,,,"Anderson, J.L., Adams, C.D., Antman, E.M., Bridges, C.R., Califf, R.M., Casey, D.E., Chavey, W.E., Wright, R.S., ACC/AHA 2007 guidelines for the management of patents with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction - Executive summary (2007) J Am Coll Cardiol, 50, pp. 652-726; Antman, E.M., Hand, M., Armstrong, P.W., Bates, E.R., Green, L.A., Halaysyamani, L.K., Hochman, J.S., Smith, S.C., 2007 Focused update of the ACC/AHA 2004 guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (2008) J Am Coll Cardiol, 51, pp. 210-247; Schwartz, G.G., Olsson, A.G., Ezekowitz, M.D., Ganz, P., Oliver, M.F., Waters, D., Zeiher, A., Stern, T., Effects of atorvastatin on early recurrent ischemic events in acute coronary syndromes: The MIRACL study: A randomized controlled trial (2001) JAMA, 285, pp. 1711-1718. , Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (M.I.R.A.C.L.)

In Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid-lowering (IDEAL), we compared cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL min-1 1.73 m-2) and analysed relationships between lipoprotein components (LC) and major coronary events (MCE) and other cardiovascular (CV) events. Design. Exploratory analysis of CV endpoints in a randomized trial comparing high dose of atorvastatin to usual dose of simvastatin on MCE. Settings. Patients with CKD were compared with the non-CKD patients. Cox regression models were used to study the relationships between on-treatment levels of LC and incident MCE. Findings. Chronic kidney disease was strongly associated with cardiovascular end-points including total mortality. In patients with CKD, a significant benefit of high dose atorvastatin treatment was found for any CV events, stroke and peripheral artery disease, but not for MCE. However, all cardiovascular end-points except stroke and CV mortality were reduced in the non-CKD group. Differential changes in LC or relationships to LC could not explain the different treatment outcomes in MCE in the two groups. Interpretation. Chronic kidney disease was a powerful risk factor for all cardiovascular end-points. The reason why the significant reductions achieved by high-dose statin treatment in most CV end-points in the non-CKD group were only in part matched by similar reductions in the CKD patients is not apparent. This difference did not result from differential changes in or relations to LC, but limited power may have increased the possibility of chance findings. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Apolipoproteins; Cardiovascular disease; Chronic kidney disease; Lipoproteins; Statin treatment","apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; atorvastatin; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; simvastatin; artery disease; article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney disease; clinical trial; coronary artery bypass graft; disease association; glomerulus filtration rate; human; mortality; outcome assessment; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; priority journal; risk factor; stroke; treatment outcome; Acute Disease; Aged; Anticholesteremic Agents; Biological Markers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Heart Arrest; Heptanoic Acids; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Predictive Value of Tests; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Pyrroles; Regression Analysis; Simvastatin",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; cholesterol, 57-88-5; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Anticholesteremic Agents; Biological Markers; Heptanoic Acids; Lipoproteins; Pyrroles; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9; atorvastatin, 110862-48-1",,,,"Parikh, N.I., Hwang, S.-J., Larson, M.G., Meigs, J.B., Levy, D., Fox, C.S., Cardiovascular disease risk factors in chronic kidney disease: Overall burden and rates of treatment and control (2006) Archives of Internal Medicine, 166 (17), pp. 1884-1891. , http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/166/17/1884, DOI 10.1001/archinte.166.17.1884; Go, A.S., Chertow, G.M., Fan, D., McCulloch, C.E., Hsu, C.-Y., Chronic kidney disease and the risks of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization (2004) New England Journal of Medicine, 351 (13), pp. 1296-1305+1370. , DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa041031; Pinkau, T., Hilgers, K.F., Veelken, R., Mann, J.F.E., How does minor renal dysfunction influence cardiovascular risk and the management of cardiovascular disease?

A naturally occurring variant of the CCR5 gene CCR532, exists at allele frequencies of typically 10% in European populations and results in a nonfunctional CCR5 receptor. Methods and Results-The CCR5Δ32 deletion and 26 other variants within the chemokine receptor 2-CCR5-chemokine receptor-like protein 2 (CCRL2) gene cluster spanning 59 kilobases of chromosome 3 were genotyped in 5748 subjects from the Treating to New Targets atorvastatin trial to determine whether genetic associations could be identified with circulating lipid values and cardiovascular disease. Our results demonstrate an association between the CCR5Δ32 deletion and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased plasma triglycerides, both of which are beneficial from a cardiovascular perspective. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1154428, rs6808835, and rs6791599) in CCRL2 in linkage disequilibrium (r 2≥0.65) with CCR5Δ32 and located up to 45 kilobases distal to it were associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides findings were replicated in an additional set of &gt;6000 individuals from the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering atorvastatin trial. Conclusions-Our study provides evidence that a locus within the region of the genome encompassing the CCR5-CCRL2 region is associated with lipid levels and suggests that chemokine activity influences lipid levels in populations with preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Background: Time-to-first-event analysis of data is frequently utilized to provide efficacy outcome information in coronary heart disease prevention trials. However, during the course of such long-term trials, a large number of events occur subsequent to the first event, the analysis of which will be precluded by this approach. Methods: The Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld method allows the analysis of repeated occurrence of events of the same type or of entirely different natures. It regards the recurrence times as multivariate event (failure) times, and models the marginal (individual) distribution for each event with the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: In the IDEAL trial, compared with patients taking simvastatin 20 to 40 mg daily, patients receiving atorvastatin 80 mg daily had their relative risk of a first cardiovascular event reduced by 17% (p < 0.0001), of a second by 24% (p < 0.0001), of a third by 19% (p = 0.035), of a fourth by 24% (p = 0.058), and of a fifth by 28% (p = 0.117). Conclusions: Our results indicate that intensive statin therapy continues to be more effective than standard statin therapy, even beyond the first event, and suggest that clinicians should not hesitate to prescribe high-dose statin therapy for patients experiencing multiple recurrent cardiovascular events. © 2009 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","cardiovascular events; statins; WLW method","atorvastatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; simvastatin; article; clinical trial; comparative study; congestive heart failure; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug treatment failure; female; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; open study; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; unstable angina pectoris; Angina, Unstable; Coronary Disease; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Heptanoic Acids; Hospitalization; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Revascularization; Proportional Hazards Models; Pyrroles",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Heptanoic Acids; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Pyrroles; atorvastatin, 110862-48-1",,,,"Grundy, S.M., The changing face of cardiovascular risk (2005) J Am Coll Cardiol, 46, pp. 173-175; Hansson, L., Hedner, T., Dahlof, B., Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE) study: a novel design for intervention trials (1992) Blood Press, 1, pp. 113-119; Pedersen, T.R., Faergeman, O., Kastelein, J.P., Design and baseline characteristics of incremental decrease in end points through aggressive lipid lowering study (IDEAL) (2004) Am J Cardiol, 94, pp. 720-724; Pedersen, T.P., Faergeman, O., Kastelein, J.P., High-dose atorvastatin vs. usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction.

The trials compared atorvastatin 80 mg/day with moderate-dose statin therapy (simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day in IDEAL and atorvastatin 10 mg/day in TNT) in patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease or a history of myocardial infarction. The outcome measurement in the present research was CVE occurring after the first year of the trial. After adjusting for age, gender, and study, risk of CVEs increased with increasing TGs (p <0.001 for trend across quintiles of TGs). Patients in the highest quintile had a 63% higher rate of CVEs than patients in the lowest quintile (hazard ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.46 to 1.81) and the relation of TGs to risk was apparent even within the normal range of TGs. The ability of TG measurements to predict risk decreased when high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B:apolipoprotein A-1 were included in the statistical analysis, and it was abolished with inclusion of further variables (diabetes, body mass index, glucose, hypertension, and smoking; (p = 0.044 and 0.621, respectively, for trend across quintiles of TGs). Similar results were obtained in patients in whom low-density lipoprotein cholesterol had been lowered to guideline-recommended levels. In conclusion, even slightly increased TG levels are associated with higher risk of recurrence of CVEs in statin-treated patients and should be considered a useful marker of risk. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Aims: To employ the Incremental Decrease in End points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Trial (IDEAL) study database to assess the association of on-treatment lipoprotein components with prediction of HF events and to compare their predictive value with that of established risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Methods: We used Cox regression models to study the relationships between on-treatment levels of apolipoproteins A1 and B to subsequent HF. Chi square information value from the log likelihood was used to compare the predictive value of lipoprotein components with established risk factors of HF. Findings: In the IDEAL study, on-treatment apolipoproteins proved to be associated with the occurrence of new-onset HF. Variables related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) carried less predictive information than those related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and apoA-1 was the single variable most strongly associated with HF. LDL-C was less predictive than both non-HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL-C) and apoB. The ratio of apoB to apoA-1 was most strongly related to HF after adjustment for potential confounders, among which diabetes had a stronger correlation with HF than did hypertension. ApoB/apoA-1 carried approximately 2.2 times more of the statistical information value than that of diabetes. Calculation of the net reclassification improvement index revealed that about 3.7% of the patients had to be reclassified into more correct categories of risk once apoB/apoA-1 was added to the adjustment factors. The reduction in risk by intensive lipid-lowering treatment as compared to usual-dose simvastatin was well predicted by the difference in apoB/apoA-1 on-treatment levels. Interpretation: The on-treatment ratio of apoB/apoA-1 was the strongest predictor of HF in CHD patients of both IDEAL treatment arms combined, mostly driven by the strong association with apoA-1, whereas LDL-C and non-HDL-C were less able to predict HF outcome. The predictive information value contained within apoB/apoA-1 was about 2.2 times more than that of diabetes. Between-treatment group differences in HF were to a significant extent explained by on-treatment differences in apoB/apoA-1, mostly through the changes in apoB. We argue therefore, on-treatment lipoprotein components contribute to the overall future risk of HF in statin-treated patients with CHD. © 2009.","Apolipoproteins; Congestive heart failure; Lipoproteins; Risk prediction; Statin","apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; atorvastatin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; simvastatin; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; congestive heart failure; diabetes mellitus; drug dose increase; heart failure; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; prediction; priority journal; risk assessment; risk reduction; triacylglycerol blood level; Aged; Coronary Disease; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Predictive Value of Tests; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk; Risk Factors; Simvastatin",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9",,,,"Jessup, M., Brozena, S., Heart failure (2003) N Engl J Med, 348 (20), pp. 2007-2018; Velagaleti, R.S., Vasan, R.S., Heart failure in the twenty-first century: is it a coronary artery disease or hypertension problem?

Adherence was high in both treatment groups but significantly higher in patients treated with simvastatin. DESIGN: The Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering was a prescription trial with a prospective randomized open label endpoint evaluation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adherence was calculated as exposure time on prescribed drugs divided by total follow-up time until death or end of follow-up and was a potential confounder. Adjusting for categorical adherence below or above 80% by two methods revealed that the relative risk reduction of the primary endpoint was more in the region of 15% (P=0.02) than 11% as found unadjusted. Censoring at the first occurrence of a cardiovascular event rather than at death increased this estimate to 17% (P=0.02). Noncardiovascular mortality was reduced on atorvastatin treatment by 21% (1-37%) after adjustment for adherence, whereas such reduction was not observed for cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSION: This study found that the difference in adherence between treatment groups may have underestimated the true effect of the treatment differential. Usage of prospective randomized open label endpoint evaluation design should be carefully considered when well-known treatments are compared with rather new ones and especially in segments where patients could be more vulnerable, as in the elderly. Nonadherers in a clinical trial may be at especially high risk of fatal and nonfatal endpoints from various diseases and should be carefully monitored. © 2009 The European Society of Cardiology.","Adherence; Confounding; Coronary heart disease; Randomized trial","antilipemic agent; atorvastatin; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; pravastatin; simvastatin; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; article; cardiovascular risk; clinical evaluation; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug safety; drug tolerance; female; follow up; human; intensive care; major clinical study; male; mortality; open study; patient compliance; prescription; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; risk reduction; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment refusal; Aged; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Drug Prescriptions; Europe; Female; Heptanoic Acids; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Odds Ratio; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Pyrroles; Research Design; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Simvastatin; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; pravastatin, 81093-37-0, 81131-70-6; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Heptanoic Acids; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Pyrroles; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9; atorvastatin, 110862-48-1",,,,"Pedersen, T.P., Faergeman, O., Kastelein, J.P., Olsson, A.G., Tikkanen, M.J., Holme, I., High-dose atorvastatin vs. usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction.The IDEAL study: A randomized controlled trial (2005) JAMA, 294, pp. 2437-2445; Hansson, L., Hedner, T., Dahlof, B., Prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) study: A novel design for intervention trials (1992) Blood Press, 1, pp. 113-119; Cannon, C.P., Braunwald, E., McCabe, C.H., Raler, M.D., Rouleau, J.L., Belder, R., Intensive versus moderate lipid lowering with statins after acute coronary syndromes (2004) N Engl J Med, 350, pp. 1495-1504; Larosa, J.C., Grundy, S.M., Waters, D.D., Shear, C., Barter, P., Fruchart, J.C., Intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease (2005) N Engl J Med, 352, pp. 1425-1435; Pedersen, T.R., Faergeman, O., Kastelein, J.J.P., Olsson, A.G., Tikkanen, M.J., Holme, I., Design and baseline characteristics of incremental decrease in end points through aggressive lipid lowering study (IDEAL) (2004) Am J Cardiol, 94, pp. 720-724; The Coronary Drug Research Group.

The IDEAL study was a 4.8-year prospective, randomized trial comparing ""usual"" simvastatin treatment (20 to 40 mg/day, n = 4,449) with high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg/day, n = 4,439) in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). At baseline, 94% of patients (n = 8,351) had no history of HF. During the course of the trial, there were 222 new or recurrent hospitalizations for HF (57 and 165 in those with and without HF at baseline, respectively), 123 (2.8%) in the simvastatin group and 99 (2.2%) in the atorvastatin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 1.05, p = 0.11). After adjustments, atorvastatin 80 mg was associated with a 26% decrease of new HF events compared with simvastatin 20 to 40 mg (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.97, p = 0.03). Atorvastatin tended to be associated with fewer HF events in those with HF at baseline (n = 537, HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11, p = 0.11) and those without HF at baseline (n = 8,351, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09, p = 0.15). Also, HF without preceding MI (n = 187) was decreased (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.97, p = 0.03). In conclusion, atorvastatin 80 mg was more efficient than simvastatin 20 to 40 mg in preventing development of HF in patients with previous MI. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Several cardiovascular end points were evaluated, including the occurrence of a first major coronary event (MCE; nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or resuscitated cardiac arrest), the primary end point of the trial, and occurrence of any cardiovascular event (MCE, stroke, revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, and peripheral artery disease). Although there were no significant interactions between age and treatment, the magnitude of effect in favor of atorvastatin was higher in younger versus older patients (occurrence of first MCE, hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.98; and HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.15, respectively; occurrence of any cardiovascular (CV) event, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; and HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, respectively). These results were likely influenced by adherence, which was lower in older patients and those receiving atorvastatin compared with those receiving simvastatin. Rates of any reported serious adverse event were higher in older patients, but did not differ between the 2 statin groups. In conclusion, except for any CV events in the older group, significant reductions in primary and secondary end points were observed only in patients <65 years of age.

The ECLIPSE study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of force-titrated treatment with rosuvastatin (10-40 mg) with that of atorvastatin (10-80 mg) in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia. Methods: In this 24-week, open-label, randomized, multinational, parallel-group study, 1,036 patients were randomized to rosuvastatin (n = 522) or atorvastatin (n = 514). Results: At all time points, a significantly greater percentage of patients on rosuvastatin treatment achieved the NCEP ATP III LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l), the 2003 European LDL-C target of <2.5 or 3.0 mmol/l (100 or 115 mg/dl) and the LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), a goal suggested for very high-risk patients (p < 0.001 for all). Rosuvastatin also achieved significantly greater improvements in components of the atherogenic lipid profile versus atorvastatin. Both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: Rosuvastatin titrated across its recommended dose range provides a more favorable effect on lipoprotein variables than atorvastatin, enabling more high-risk patients to achieve recommended LDL-C goals.

Selection of healthy patients for CR is a relatively unexplored problem. Our aims were to identify predictors of CR-attendance and to describe the prognosis as concerns mortality, re-admission and invasive treatment among CR-attendees as compared to CR-non-attendees. Methods: From a cohort of 138 290 persons aged 30-69 years, we identified consecutive MI patients, between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2002. There were 206 MI patients, who survived until admission, and among the 200 who survived 30 days, 145 (72.5%) attended a comprehensive CR programme. Data were obtained from patient charts and from Danish population registers, and as a result we had no non-participation for the study. Results: The 2-year mortality proportions for patients surviving the first 30 days of admission were 2.8 and 21.8% among CR-attendees and CR-non-attendees, respectively (P < 0.0001). Among CR-non-attendees, there was a smaller fraction having an invasive treatment performed as compared with CR-attendees. By multiple logistic regression controlling for age and sex, CR-attendance was associated with chest pain, whereas CR-non-attendance was associated with low gross income, single living and inverted T-wave in the electrocardiogram.Conclusion: CR attendance rate was 72.5%. Non-attendees have a higher mortality risk, which in part may be attributed to selection of healthy patients. Non-attendees are older and more likely to have atypical symptoms at admission, a low socioeconomic status and to live alone. Special attention is needed to improve CR attendance among such patients. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Public Health Association.

Few studies have looked into the ability of measurements of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) or apoB/apoA-1 to predict new coronary heart disease (CHD) events in patients with CHD on statin treatment. Aims. In the IDEAL trial, to compare lipoprotein components to predict CHD events and to what degree differences in those parameters could explain the observed outcome. Methods. We compared the ability of treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/day to that of simvastatin 20-40 mg/day to prevent CHD events in patients with CHD and used Cox regression models to study the relationships between on-treatment levels of lipoprotein components to subsequent major coronary events (MCE). Findings. Variables related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) carried more predictive information than those related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), but LDL-C was less predictive than both non-HDL-C and apoB. The ratio of apoB to apoA-1 was most strongly related to MCE. However, for estimating differences in relative risk reduction between the treatment groups, apoB and non-HDL-C were the strongest predictors. Interpretation. The on-treatment level of apoB/apoA-1 was the strongest predictor of MCE in the pooled patient population, whereas apoB and non-HDL-C were best able to explain the difference in outcome between treatment groups. Measurements of apoB and apoA-1 should be more widely available for routine clinical assessments. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

Methods: In a matched, cluster-randomised, controlled trial in eight European countries, six pairs of hospitals and six pairs of general practices were assigned to an intervention programme (INT) or usual care (UC) for patients with coronary heart disease or those at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoints-measured at 1 year-were family-based lifestyle change; management of blood pressure, lipids, and blood glucose to target concentrations; and prescription of cardioprotective drugs. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered as ISRCTN 71715857. Findings: 1589 and 1499 patients with coronary heart disease in hospitals and 1189 and 1128 at high risk were assigned to INT and UC, respectively. In patients with coronary heart disease who smoked in the month before the event, 136 (58%) in the INT and 154 (47%) in the UC groups did not smoke 1 year afterwards (difference in change 10·4%, 95% CI -0·3 to 21·2, p=0·06). Reduced consumption of saturated fat (196 [55%] vs 168 [40%]; 17·3%, 6·4 to 28·2, p=0·009), and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (680 [72%] vs 349 [35%]; 37·3%, 18·1 to 56·5, p=0·004), and oily fish (156 [17%] vs 81 [8%]; 8·9%, 0·3 to 17·5, p=0·04) at 1 year were greatest in the INT group. High-risk individuals and partners showed changes only for fruit and vegetables (p=0·005). Blood-pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg was attained by both coronary (615 [65%] vs 547 [55%]; 10·4%, 0·6 to 20·2, p=0·04) and high-risk (586 [58%] vs 407 [41%]; 16·9%, 2·0 to 31·8, p=0·03) patients in the INT groups. Achievement of total cholesterol of less than 5 mmol/L did not differ between groups, but in high-risk patients the difference in change from baseline to 1 year was 12·7% (2·4 to 23·0, p=0·02) in favour of INT. In the hospital group, prescriptions for statins were higher in the INT group (810 [86%] vs 794 [80%]; 6·0%, -0·5 to 11·5, p=0·04). In general practices in the intervention groups, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (297 [29%] INT vs 196 [20%] UC; 8·5%, 1·8 to 15·2, p=0·02) and statins (381 [37%] INT vs 232 [22%] UC; 14·6%, 2·5 to 26·7, p=0·03) were more frequently prescribed. Interpretation: To achieve the potential for cardiovascular prevention, we need local preventive cardiology programmes adapted to individual countries, which are accessible by all hospitals and general practices caring for coronary and high-risk patients.

However, the fact that the very decision on reimbursement - whether individual, conditional or general - influences the cost-effectiveness of the drug considered as a medical intervention is often overlooked. Material and methods: In the computation of cost-effectiveness not only purely medical effects should be taken into consideration but also the risk that a patient in need of treatment is not treated - possibly as a consequence of the procedure involved in applying for individual reimbursement - as well as the risk of wasting resources on treatment that is not medically justified. The method is illustrated by a concrete example based on the data from treatment of coronary heart disease patients with statins in the period 1994-98 where reimbursement was given on an individual basis and after 1998 when conditional reimbursement was introduced. Results: The individually-based regime turns out to have been very cost-ineffective, given that it prevented medically appropriate treatment of a large number of patients. A simple calculation along the principles outlined here would have shown this resource-loss. Discussion: Including the reimbursement regime in the assessment of cost-effectiveness seems to be a useful tool for preventing the loss of patients who could have been treated at a lower cost with the medical intervention considered than with other interventions currently used in the health care sector.",,"drug; hypocholesterolemic agent; article; cardiovascular disease; cost benefit analysis; drug cost; economics; feasibility study; human; reimbursement; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drug Costs; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Reimbursement Mechanisms",,"Anticholesteremic Agents; Pharmaceutical Preparations",,,,"Randomized trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1383-1389. , Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Group; Baigent, C., Keech, A., Kearney, P.M., Efficacy and safety of cholesterol-lowering treatment: Prospective meta-analysis of data from 90,056 participants in 14 randomized trials of statins (2005) Lancet, 366, pp. 1267-1278; Jönsson, B., Johannesson, M., Kjekshus, J., Cost-effectiveness of cholesterol lowering.

Background: High plasma levels of HDL-C and apoA-I are inversely related to the risk of CAD. However, recent data suggest that this relationship does not hold true for very high HDL-C levels, particularly when a preponderance of large HDL particles is observed. Methods: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of 2 prospective studies: the IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering; n = 8,888) trial comparing the efficacy of high-dose to usual-dose statin treatment for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, and the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition)-Norfolk case-control study, including apparently healthy individuals who did (cases, n = 858) or did not (control patients, n = 1,491) develop CAD during follow-up. In IDEAL, only HDL-C and apoA-I were available; in EPIC-Norfolk, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-determined HDL particle sizes were also available. Results: In the IDEAL study, higher HDL-C proved a significant major cardiac event risk factor following adjustment for age, gender, smoking, apoA-I, and apoB. A similar association was observed for HDL particle size in EPIC-Norfolk. Increased risk estimates were particularly present in the high ends of the distributions. In contrast, apoA-I remained negatively associated across the major part of its distribution in both studies. Conclusions: When apoA-I and apoB are kept constant, HDL-C and HDL particle size may confer risk at very high values. This does not hold true for very high levels of apoA-I at fixed levels of HDL-C and apoB. These findings may have important consequences for assessment and treatment of CAD risk. © 2008 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",,"apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; atorvastatin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; simvastatin; adult; article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; case control study; coronary artery disease; female; follow up; human; lipoprotein blood level; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; particle size; priority journal; Aged; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoproteins B; Biological Markers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Cholesterol, HDL; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoproteins B; Biological Markers; Cholesterol, HDL; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors",,,,"Castelli, W.P., Garrison, R.J., Wilson, P.W., Abbott, R.D., Kalousdian, S., Kannel, W.B., Incidence of coronary heart disease and lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

We aimed to measure directly the incidence of the entire spectrum of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), consisting of unstable angina pectoris, MI and sudden cardiac death (SCD), by use of the new criteria for MI as proposed in 2000. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: From a cohort of 138 290 residents of the municipality of Aarhus, Denmark, aged 30-69 years, with a demographic structure known at the individual population member level, we prospectively identified all consecutive ACS patients from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2002. The population was identified from Danish Population Registers. RESULTS: A total of 189 victims of SCD and 457 ACS patients who survived until admission to hospital were present. Consequently, crude incidence rate of ACS was 234 per 100 000 person-years. Unstable angina pectoris constituted for 16.9%, MI for 53.8% and SCD for 29.3% of ACS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Crude incidence rates of ACS were 137 and 331 per 100 000 person years for women and men, respectively. The incidence rate of ACS, as measured directly, was insignificantly 6% higher than expected from Danish administrative databases. © 2007 European Society of Cardiology.","Cohort study; Incidence; Myocardial infarction; Sudden cardiac death; Unstable angina","acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; article; controlled study; coronary care unit; demography; Denmark; disease course; disease severity; electrocardiogram; female; health care planning; heart infarction; hospital admission; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; medical record; priority journal; sudden death; survival rate; thorax pain; unstable angina pectoris; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged",,,,,,"Tunstall-Pedoe, H., Kuulasmaa, K., Mahonen, M., Tolonen, H., Ruokokoski, E., Amouyel, P., Contribution of trends in survival and coronary-event rates to changes in coronary heart disease mortality: 10-year results from 37 WHO MONICA project populations.

Only four mutations were considered neutral, while the other 30 are likely to cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Mutations in the LDL receptor gene, causing the disease, were identified in 41 (55%) out of 74 families with FH. Mutation R3500Q in apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene was not detected in all probands. Therefore in the families lacking mutations hypercholesterolemia was caused by mutations in the introns of the LDL receptor gene or by other genetic factors. Nineteen mutations causing disease progression were described in St. Petersburg for the first time, while 18 of them are specific for Russia. Among Ashkenazi Jews, predominant mutation G197del was detected in 30% (7 out of 22) of patients with FH. In the Slavic population of St. Petersburg, no predominant mutations were detected. Only five mutations were identified in two Slavic families, while 24 were found in unique families. These data are indicative of the lack of a strong founder effect for FH in the St. Petersburg population. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,,,,,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Scriver, C.R., Beaudet, A.L., Sly, W.S., Familial Hypercholesterolemia (2001) The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease, pp. 2863-2914. , McGraw Hill New York; Villéger, L., Abifadel, M., Allard, D., The UMDLDLR Database: Additions to the Software and 490 New Entries to the Database (2002) Hum.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for mortality among unselected patients and to use the statistical model to identify patients at low or high mortality risk. Methods: From April 1, 2000, to March 31, 2002, we identified all consecutive patients aged 30 to 69 years admitted to the 2 coronary care units covering the municipality of Aarhus, Denmark (population, 138 290). ACS was considered a possible diagnosis if the physician at admission (1) had noted the presence or absence of chest pain, (2) performed a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and (3) measured markers of myocardial necrosis. In 1576 consecutive patients these criteria were fulfilled. Results: By logistic regression, predictors of mortality were age 60 and older, ST elevation, right bundle-branch block, arrhythmia, elevated markers of myocardial necrosis, and the diagnosis of ACS. The predictive validity of the model, as indicated by receiver operating characteristic curve area, was 85.7%, 87.8%, and 80.1% for 7-, 30-, and 365-day mortality, respectively. Conclusions: Mortality may be predicted with high precision based on a statistical model. Identification of survivors by the use of a statistical model was superior as compared to simply ruling out the clinical diagnosis of ACS. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study was to identify sociodemographic population risk indicators of an initial episode of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including unstable angina pectoris (UAP), myocardial infarction (MI), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Design: Cohort study of 138 290 residents of the municipality of Aarhus, Denmark, aged 30-69 years. Information on population members' individual age, sex, social background, and eventual death was obtained from Danish Population Registers. Setting: University hospital. Patients: The study prospectively identified 646 victims of ACS from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2002. Main results: Based on multiple logistic regression, age and single living were found to be positively associated with incident ACS in both sexes. Women >60 years living alone and men >50 years living alone were at especially high risk. They constituted only 5.4% and 7.7% of the source population, respectively, but they accounted for 34.3% and 62.4% of ACS patients dying within 30 days. Conclusions: Single living is associated with an increased risk of ACS. Thus, risk groups identified by use of information on their age and family structure may be targets for future more focused and cost effective preventive strategies. In Western populations, such high risk groups will constitute comparatively limited parts of the population, and in Denmark they are easily identifiable in routine population registers.",,"cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; family structure; health risk; multiple regression; risk assessment; risk factor; social status; acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; article; atherosclerosis; clinical trial; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; demography; female; health program; heart infarction; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; multiple regression; prospective study; risk factor; social aspect; sudden death; unstable angina pectoris; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Single Person; Socioeconomic Factors; Aarhus [Denmark]; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Angina",,,,,,"Beoglehole, R., International trends in coronary heart disease mortality and incidence rates (1999) J Cardiovasc Risk, 6, pp. 63-68; Lampe, F.C., Morris, R.W., Walker, M., Trends in rates of different forms of diagnosed coronary heart disease, 1978 to 2000: Prospective, population based study of British men (2005) BMJ, 330, p. 1046; Tunstall-Pedoe, H., Kuulasmaa, K., Mahonen, M., Contribution of trends in survival and coronary-event rates to changes in coronary heart disease mortality: 10-Year results from 37 WHO MONICA project populations.

However, although atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (eg, heart attack and stroke) accounts for more death and disability than all cancers combined, there are no national screening guidelines for asymptomatic (subclinical) atherosclerosis, and there is no government- or healthcare-sponsored reimbursement for atherosclerosis screening. Part I and Part II of this consensus statement elaborated on new discoveries in the field of atherosclerosis that led to the concept of the ""vulnerable patient."" These landmark discoveries, along with new diagnostic and therapeutic options, have set the stage for the next step: translation of this knowledge into a new practice of preventive cardiology. The identification and treatment of the vulnerable patient are the focuses of this consensus statement. In this report, the Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Education (SHAPE) Task Force presents a new practice guideline for cardiovascular screening in the asymptomatic at-risk population. In summary, the SHAPE Guideline calls for noninvasive screening of all asymptomatic men 45-75 years of age and asymptomatic women 55-75 years of age (except those defined as very low risk) to detect and treat those with subclinical atherosclerosis. A variety of screening tests are available, and the cost-effectiveness of their use in a comprehensive strategy must be validated. Some of these screening tests, such as measurement of coronary artery calcification by computed tomography scanning and carotid artery intima-media thickness and plaque by ultrasonography, have been available longer than others and are capable of providing direct evidence for the presence and extent of atherosclerosis. Both of these imaging methods provide prognostic information of proven value regarding the future risk of heart attack and stroke. Careful and responsible implementation of these tests as part of a comprehensive risk assessment and reduction approach is warranted and outlined by this report. Other tests for the detection of atherosclerosis and abnormal arterial structure and function, such as magnetic resonance imaging of the great arteries, studies of small and large artery stiffness, and assessment of systemic endothelial dysfunction, are emerging and must be further validated. The screening results (severity of subclinical arterial disease) combined with risk factor assessment are used for risk stratification to identify the vulnerable patient and initiate appropriate therapy. The higher the risk, the more vulnerable an individual is to a near-term adverse event. Because <10% of the population who test positive for atherosclerosis will experience a near-term event, additional risk stratification based on reliable markers of disease activity is needed and is expected to further focus the search for the vulnerable patient in the future. All individuals with asymptomatic atherosclerosis should be counseled and treated to prevent progression to overt clinical disease. The aggressiveness of the treatment should be proportional to the level of risk. Individuals with no evidence of subclinical disease may be reassured of the low risk of a future near-term event, yet encouraged to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and maintain appropriate risk factor levels. Early heart attack care education is urged for all individuals with a positive test for atherosclerosis. The SHAPE Task Force reinforces existing guidelines for the screening and treatment of risk factors in younger populations. Cardiovascular healthcare professionals and policymakers are urged to adopt the SHAPE proposal and its attendant cost-effectiveness as a new strategy to contain the epidemic of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the rising cost of therapies associated with this epidemic. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Deletions and other major structural rearrangements of the LDLR gene account for approximately 5% of the mutations in many populations. Methods: Five genomic deletions in the LDLR gene were characterized by amplification of mutated alleles and sequencing to identify genomic breakpoints. A diagnostic assay based on duplex PCR for the exon 7 - 8 deletion was developed to discriminate between heterozygotes and normals, and bioinformatic analyses were used to identify interspersed repeats flanking the deletions. Results: In one case 15 bp had been inserted at the site of the deleted DNA, and, in all five cases, Alu elements flanked the sites where deletions had occurred. An assay developed to discriminate the wildtype and the deletion allele in a simple duplex PCR detected three FH patients as heterozygotes, and two individuals with normal lipid values were detected as normal homozygotes. Conclusion: The identification of the breakpoints should make it possible to develop specific tests for these mutations, and the data provide further evidence for the role of Alu repeats in intragenic deletions. © 2006 Nissen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"genomic DNA; low density lipoprotein receptor; Alu sequence; article; bioinformatics; clinical article; controlled study; Denmark; exon; familial hypercholesterolemia; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene mutation; gene sequence; genome analysis; heterozygote detection; homozygote; human; interspersed repeat; polymerase chain reaction; wild type; Alu Elements; Chromosome Breakage; Computational Biology; Denmark; Exons; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Receptors, LDL; Sequence Deletion",,"Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Schrott, H.G., Hazzard, W.R., Bierman, E.L., Motulsky, A.G., Hyperlipidemia in coronary heart disease.

Accordingly, all of the national and transnational screening and therapeutic guidelines are based on total or LDL cholesterol. This presumes that cholesterol is the most important lipoprotein-related proatherogenic risk variable. On the contrary, risk appears to be more directly related to the number of circulating atherogenic particles that contact and enter the arterial wall than to the measured concentration of cholesterol in these lipoprotein fractions. Each of the atherogenic lipoprotein particles contains a single molecule of apolipoprotein (apo) B and therefore the concentration of apo B provides a direct measure of the number of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins. Evidence from fundamental, epidemiological and clinical trial studies indicates that apo B is superior to any of the cholesterol indices to recognize those at increased risk of vascular disease and to judge the adequacy of lipid-lowering therapy. On the basis of this evidence, we believe that apo B should be included in all guidelines as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. In addition, the present target adopted by the Canadian guideline groups of an apo B &lt;90 mg dL-1 in high-risk patients should be reassessed in the light of the new clinical trial results and a new ultra-low target of &lt;80 mg dL-1 be considered. The evidence also indicates that the apo B/apo A-I ratio is superior q3to any of the conventional cholesterol ratios in patients without symptomatic vascular disease or diabetes to evaluate the lipoprotein-related risk of vascular disease. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Apo B; Coronary heart disease; Guidelines; LDL cholesterol; Lipid-lowering therapy","apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; diabetes mellitus; high risk patient; human; ischemic heart disease; practice guideline; priority journal; review; risk assessment; vascular disease; Antilipemic Agents; Apolipoproteins B; Biological Markers; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Drug Monitoring; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Practice Guidelines; Risk Assessment",,"cholesterol, 57-88-5; Antilipemic Agents; Apolipoproteins B; Biological Markers; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, LDL",,,,"Law, M.R., Wald, N.J., Rudnicka, A.R., Quantifying effect of statins on low density lipoprotein cholesterol, ischaemic heart disease and stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis (2003) BMJ, 326, pp. 1423-9; Packard, C.J., Shepherd, J., Lipoprotein heterogeneity and apolipoprotein B metabolism (1997) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 17, pp. 3542-56; Berneis, K.K., Krauss, R.M., Metabolic origins and clinical significance of LDL heterogeneity (2002) J Lipid Res, 43, pp. 1363-79; Chapman, M.J., Paplaud, P.M., Luc, G., Further resolution of the low density lipoprotein spectrum in normal human plasma: Physicochemical characteristics of discrete subspecies separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation (1988) J Lipid Res, 29, pp. 442-58; Teng, B., Thompson, G.R., Sniderman, A.D., Forte, T.M., Krauss, R.M., Kwiterovich, P.O., Composition and distribution of low density lipoprotein fractions in hyperapobetalipoproteinaemia, normolipidaemia and familial hypercholesterolaemia (1983) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 80, pp. 6662-6; Packard, C.J., Demant, T., Stewart, J.P., Apolipoprotein B metabolism and the distribution of VLDL and LDL subfractions (2000) J Lipid Res, 41, pp. 305-18; Sniderman, A.D., Scantlebury, T., Cianflone, K., Hypertriglyceridemic hyperapoB: The unappreciated atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (2001) Ann Intern Med, 135, pp. 447-59; Sniderman, A.D., Furberg, C.D., Keech, A., Apolipoproteins versus lipids as indices of coronary risk and as targets for statin therapy treatment (2003) Lancet, 361, pp. 777-80; Elovson, J., Chatterton, J.E., Bell, G.T., Plasma very low density lipoproteins contain a single molecule of apolipoprotein B (1988) J Lipid Res, 29, pp. 1461-73; Lamarche, B., Moorjani, S., Lupien, P.J., Apoprotein A-1 and B levels and the risk of ischemic heart disease during a 5 year follow-up of men in the Québec Cardiovascular Study (1996) Circulation, 94, pp. 273-8; St-Pierre, A., Cantin, B., Dagenais, G.R., Low-density lipoprotein subfractions and the long-term risk of ischemic heart disease in men. 13-year follow-up data from the Quebec Cardiovascular Study (2005) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 25, pp. 553-9; Walldius, G., Jungner, I., Holme, I., Aastveit, A.H., Kolar, W., Steiner, E., High apolipoprotein B, low apolipoprotein A-1, and improvement in the prediction of fatal myocardial infarction (AMORIS study): A prospective study (2001) Lancet, 358, pp. 2026-33; Moss, A.J., Goldstein, R.E., Marder, V.J., Thrombogenic factors and recurrent coronary events (1999) Circulation, 99, pp. 2517-22; Corsetti, J.P., Zareba, W., Moss, A.J., Sparks, C.E., Apolipoprotein B determines risk for recurrent coronary events in postinfarction patients with metabolic syndrome (2004) Atherosclerosis, 177, pp. 367-73; Talmud, P.J., Hawe, E., Miller, G.J., Humphries, S.E., Non-fasting apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels as a useful predictor of coronary heart disease risk in middle-aged UK men (2002) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 22, pp. 1918-23; Shai, I., Rimm, E.B., Hankinson, S.E., Multivariate assessment of lipid parameters as predictors of coronary heart disease among postmenopausal women.

Objective: To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Design, Setting, and Participants: The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n=4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n=4449). Main Outcome Measure: Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. Results: During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.01; P=.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2%) and 267 (6.0%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98; P=.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P=.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76-0.91; P<.001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5%) and 143 (3.2%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73-1.15; P=.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85-1.13; P=.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0%) vs 5 (0.1%) withdrawals (P<.001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups. Conclusions: In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.

The study aimed at testing the ability of three different sets of clinical criteria to predict the results of molecular genetic analysis, and secondly test whether population-based age- and sex-specific percentiles of LDL-cholesterol offer useful supplemental information in the selection of patients for molecular genetic analysis. The patients were retrospectively categorised according to Simon Broome Register Group criteria, Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death criteria (MEDPED) and the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, and the distribution of patients was compared to the results of the molecular genetic analysis. The study illustrates a classical dilemma. Mutation detection rates (and specificities) are high only if sensitivity is very low and vice versa: to find most mutation carriers, even patients with only possible FH must be examined by molecular genetic testing leading to mutation detection rates as low as 30-40%. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In genetically heterogeneous populations, major structural rearrangements account for about 5% of patients with LDL receptor gene mutations. Methods: In this study we tested the ability of two different quantitative PCR methods, i.e. Real-Time PCR and Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), to detect deletions in the LDL receptor gene. We also reassessed the contribution of major structural rearrangements to the mutational spectrum of the LDL receptor gene in Denmark. Results: With both methods it was possible to discriminate between one and two copies of the LDL receptor gene exon 5, but the MLPA method was cheaper, and it was far more accurate and precise than Real-Time PCR. In five of 318 patients with an FH phenotype, MLPA analysis revealed five different deletions in the LDL receptor gene. Conclusion: The MLPA method was accurate, precise and at the same time effective in screening a large number of FH patients for large deletions in the LDL receptor gene. © 2005 Damgaard et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"low density lipoprotein receptor; low density lipoprotein receptor; accuracy; article; controlled study; Denmark; exon; familial hypercholesterolemia; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene rearrangement; genetic heterogeneity; genetic screening; human; major clinical study; phenotype; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; comparative study; evaluation; familial hypercholesterolemia; gene deletion; genetics; methodology; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; DNA Mutational Analysis; Gene Deletion; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptors, LDL",,"Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial Hypercholesterolemia (2001) The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease, , Edited by: Scriver CR, Beaudet A, Sly WS, Vale D.

The recently reported Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT) trial showed that a statin regimen that lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) more effectively was associated with significantly better prevention of cardiovascular events than a regimen that was thought to have greater pleiotropic effects. On the one hand, such findings should serve to refocus attention on the primary clinical goal of lowering LDL-C in our at-risk patients; on the other, it should refocus attention on the conditions that make atherosclerosis so prevalent in modern society. From the point of view of eradicating or markedly reducing prevalence of atherosclerosis, political efforts are required to enhance education and to fashion changes in policies regulating the agriculture, food, and tobacco industries. The alternative is to fully embrace the medicalization of society, whereby we focus on efforts in biotechnology and industrialized medicine to address the consequences of diseases promoted by industrialization and urbanization. © The European Society of Cardiology 2005.

Despite thirteen different mutations of the LDL receptor gene were reported from Russia prior to 2003, the whole spectrum of disease-causing gene alterations in this country is poorly known and requires further investigation provided by the current study. Methods: Forty-five patients with clinical diagnosis of FH were tested for the apolipoprotein B (apoB) mutation R3500Q by restriction fragment length analysis. After exclusion of R3500Q mutation high-sensitive fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and automatic DNA sequencing were used to search for mutations in the LDL receptor gene. Results: We found twenty one rare sequence variations of the LDL receptor gene. Nineteen were probably pathogenic mutations, and two (P518P, T705I) were considered as neutral ones. Among the mutations likely to be pathogenic, eight were novel (c.670-671insG, C249X, c.936-940del5, c.1291-1331del41, W422X, c.1855-1856insA, D601N, C646S), and eleven (Q12X, IVS3+1G>A, c.651-653del3, E207X, c.925-931del7, C308Y, L380H, c.1302delG, IVS9+1G>A, V776M, V806I) have already been described in other populations. None of the patients had the R3500Q mutation in the apoB gene. Conclusions: Nineteen pathogenic mutations in the LDL receptor gene in 23 probands were identified. Two mutations c.925-931del7 and L380H are shared by St.-Petersburg population with neighbouring Finland and several other mutations with Norway, Sweden or Denmark, i.e. countries from the Baltic Sea region. Only four mutations (c.313+1G>A, c.651-653del3, C308Y and W422X) were recurrent as all those were found in two unrelated families. By this study the number of known mutations in the LDL receptor gene in St.-Petersburg area was increased nearly threefold. Analysis of all 34 low density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations found in St.-Petersburg argues against strong founder effect in Russian familial hypercholesterolemia. © 2005 Zakharova et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"apolipoprotein B; genomic DNA; low density lipoprotein receptor; DNA; adult; aged; article; Baltic States; clinical article; DNA sequence; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; gene mutation; genetic variability; human; male; population genetics; receptor gene; restriction fragment length polymorphism; Russian Federation; Scandinavia; school child; single strand conformation polymorphism; chemistry; comparative study; familial hypercholesterolemia; frameshift mutation; genetic screening; genetics; missense mutation; mutation; nucleotide sequence; pedigree; stop codon; Apolipoproteins B; Base Sequence; Codon, Nonsense; DNA; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Frameshift Mutation; Genetic Testing; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Mutation; Mutation, Missense; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Receptors, LDL; Russia",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; Apolipoproteins B; Codon, Nonsense; DNA, 9007-49-2; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolaemia (2001) The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease, 3, pp. 2863-2914. , Edited by: Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Vale D.

We tested whether this third FH locus is linked to the FH phenotype in 20 Danish families, with 158 members, without pathogenic mutations in the genes, encoding the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B (apoB). We could exclude the third FH locus as a cause of FH by genetic linkage analysis in the families taken together. Since haplotype analysis of each family nevertheless suggested that the FH phenotype co-segregated in a manner consistent with linkage to the third FH locus in three small pedigrees, we performed sequencing analysis without being able to demonstrate mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene, the main candidate gene in the third FH locus. By the same combination of genetic linkage and molecular analysis we could also exclude mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor adaptor protein and in the gene for cholesterol-7-alpha-hydroxylase as causes of FH in our sample. Although not indicating linkage to any known loci, our data still indicate that another dominant gene may be involved in causing a FH phenotype. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

IDEAL is a multicenter prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded, end point classification study. Patients who had myocardial infarction were randomized to prescription treatment with 80 mg/day of atorvastatin or 20 mg/day of simvastatin (the dose was increased to 40 mg/day at week 24 in those patients whose plasma total cholesterol remained >5.0 mmol/L, or 190 mg/dl, or whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained >3.0 mmol/L, or 115 mg/dl). The primary clinical outcome variable is the time to initial occurrence of a major coronary event, which is defined as nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, coronary death, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The study is designed to have a power of 90% to detect a relative decrease of 20% in the atorvastatin-group compared with the simvastatin-group in the number of major events caused by coronary heart disease over ∼5.5 years. The 8,888 randomized patients had the following characteristics: mean age 61.7 ± 9.5 years, 19.1% women (mean age 64.0 ± 9.5 years), baseline total cholesterol 5.1 ± 1.0 mmol/L (197 mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 3.2 ± 0.9 mmol/L (124 mg/dl), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 1.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L (46 mg/dl).

They should be helpful in everyday clinical decision-making. A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by different organisations--European Society of Cardiology (ESC), American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and other related societies. By means of links to web sites of National Societies several hundred guidelines are available. This profusion can put at stake the authority and validity of guidelines, which can only be guaranteed if they have been developed by an unquestionable decision-making process. This is one of the reasons why the ESC and others have issued recommendations for formulating and issuing guidelines. In spite of the fact that standards for issuing good quality guidelines are well defined, recent surveys of guidelines published in peer-reviewed journals between 1985 and 1998 have shown that methodological standards were not complied with in the vast majority of cases. It is therefore of great importance that guidelines and recommendations are presented in formats that are easily interpreted. Subsequently, their implementation programmes must also be well conducted. Attempts have been made to determine whether guidelines improve the quality of clinical practice and the utilisation of health resources. In addition, the legal implications of medical guidelines have been discussed and examined, resulting in position documents, which have been published by a specific task force. The ESC Committee for practice guidelines (CPG) supervises and coordinates the preparation of new guidelines and expert consensus documents produced by task forces, expert groups or consensus panels. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement of these guidelines or statements.",,"adult; aged; article; cardiovascular disease; clinical medicine; Europe; female; human; male; middle aged; practice guideline; standard; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Clinical Medicine; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged",,,,,,,"De Backer, G.email: guy.debacker@ugent.be",,,,,,,,17418267,,,14555889,"English","Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242333734

This evidence includes calculations of physiolosical LDL-cholesterol levels and data from observational and interventional epidemiologic studies, including the Heart Protection Study. However, Heart Protection Study data can also be taken to support a strategy based on percentage reductions in LDL-C rather than a strategy of attaining absolute values of LDL-C. More effective LDL-C-lowering agents, as well as combination drug therapy, will reduce LDL-C more efficiently, but it remains to be documented that such therapy is accompanied by greater reduction in risk for coronary heart disease. Moreover, even very intensive therapy will not reduce LDL-C to physiological concentrations in many patients. These considerations justify increasing emphasis on reduction in overall, multifactorial risk in individual patients at the expense of a focus on individual risk factors. © 2003 The European Society of Cardiology.

Although a few physicians understood how atherosclerosis/thrombosis of the coronary arteries caused angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, the medical community did not accept that relationship until the 1920s. In wealthy countries, the epidemic peaked in mid-century, and it is now advancing in poor countries and in countries becoming affluent. Two recent developments in methods for disease detection, however, will profoundly affect not only our understanding of the epidemic of atherosclerotic disease, but also our management of patients. A redefinition of the clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, a well-used but imperfect measure of the epidemic, was published in September 2000. Criteria employed for about 50 years have now been replaced by criteria based on sensitive biochemical markers of necrosis of as little as 1 g of myocardium, accompanied by chest discomfort or electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, or following coronary artery intervention. The new criteria, adopted by the major societies of cardiology in Europe and the United States, is likely to increase the apparent incidence and prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD). In the beginning of the twentieth century, diagnosis of CHD required an autopsy.

That has now been changed by new, non-invasive methods of computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and patients, however, asymptomatic, will expect treatment for a disease that physicians have detected.

In contrast, it is uncertain whether the severity of atherosclerotic disease differs in heterozygous FH caused by receptor-negative and receptor-defective mutations. The present authors investigated the influence of LDL receptor mutation type on the clinical phenotype in 31 patients with heterozygous FH caused by the receptor-negative, Trp23-stop mutation and in 31 patients heterozygous for the receptor defective Trp66-Gly mutation. Untreated levels of plasma LDL-cholesterol and calculated cholesterol-years score did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients. Detection of vascular disease was based on two approaches: (1) measurement of coronary calcification by spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning; and (2) ultrasonic measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Age was significantly correlated to the presence of coronary calcification, but controlling for relevant cofactors, there was no evidence that the receptor-negative mutation caused more calcification than the receptor-defective mutation. Furthermore, carotid IMT was significantly influenced by plasma concentrations of Lp(a) and triglycerides, as well as by age, sex and smoking status, but again, there was no statistically significant effect of LDL receptor gene mutational type. The similarity in vascular phenotypes was probably caused by a similar life-long burden of LDL-cholesterol in the two groups of patients.","Atherosclerosis; Coronary calcification; Familial hypercholesterolaemia; Genotype; Intima-media thickness; LDL-receptor mutations; Phenotype relationship","glycine; lipoprotein A; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein receptor; triacylglycerol; tryptophan; adult; age; aged; artery calcification; artery intima; artery media; article; atherosclerosis; calculation; cardiovascular disease; carotid artery; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery; correlation analysis; diagnostic procedure; disease severity; echography; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; gender; gene mutation; genotype phenotype correlation; heterozygosity; homozygosity; human; human tissue; lipid blood level; male; priority journal; risk factor; scoring system; smoking; spiral computer assisted tomography; statistical significance; stop codon; thickness; triacylglycerol blood level; Adult; Aged; Arteriosclerosis; Carotid Artery Diseases; Codon, Terminator; Family Health; Female; Genetic Screening; Genotype; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type I; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Mutation, Missense; Phenotype; Receptors, LDL; Risk Factors; Vascular Diseases",,"glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; Codon, Terminator; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, 2, pp. 1981-2030. , Schriver CR, Baudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D (Eds) 7th edn, New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Soutar, A.K., Update on low density lipoprotein receptor mutations (1998) Curr.

There is a also a small body of literature on endocrinologic nosology, but cardiologists almost never write about the nosology of heart disease. It does not keep them awake at night. Our understanding of the 20th-century epidemic of coronary artery disease (CAD), which dominates cardiology, has nevertheless been frustrated by problems of nosology. One of the purposes of this article is to dicuss how our understanding of the epidemic has depended on classification of disease events and on the methods used to detect them.

We studied the response to treatment with fluvastatin in 28 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as a result of a receptor-negative mutation (Trp23-stop) and in 30 patients with a receptor-binding defective mutation (Trp66-Gly) to test the hypothesis that response to treatment depends on the type of mutation. Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with fluvastatin 40 mg daily and 12 weeks of placebo treatment, preceded by a placebo run-in period of 8 weeks in a double-blind, cross-over design. Untreated plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins were similar in the two groups of patients. Plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol response to therapy tended to be less marked in receptor-binding defective patients, but the differences were not statistically significant. A tabulation of the results of the present and earlier studies suggests that differences in treatment response as an apparent function of LDL-receptor gene mutational type occur mainly in populations with recent genetic admixture ( < 400 years). In such populations, persons with the same mutation in the LDL-receptor gene are more likely to share other but undetermined genetic variations affecting the pharmacology of statins.","Drugs; Genetics; Hypercholesterolemia; Lipids; Pharmacology","cholesterol; fluindostatin; lipid; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein receptor; mevinolin; placebo; pravastatin; simvastatin; tryptophan; adult; aged; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; drug response; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; gene mutation; genetic variability; heterozygosity; human; hypothesis; lipid blood level; lipoprotein blood level; male; population; priority journal; randomization; randomized controlled trial; receptor binding; statistical analysis; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Cholesterol; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypercholesterolemia; Indoles; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Receptors, LDL; Treatment Outcome",,"Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; fluvastatin, 93957-54-1; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Indoles; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H., Brown, M.S., Familial hyper-cholesterolemia (1995), 2, pp. 1215-1250. , Schriver CR, Baudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D, eds.

Maximally induced pretreatment LDL receptor activities did not correlate with pretreatment plasma cholesterol levels or with changes in plasma cholesterol levels during treatment, and there were no significant changes in LDL receptor activity during treatment. Barring methodological problems, two explanations are possible. Insofar that LDL receptor activity in lymphocytes reflects LDL receptor activity in the liver, the results suggest that the primary response to treatment with fluvastatin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients is not enhanced LDL receptor activity.

Nevertheless, the relationship of concentrations of plasma triglycerides to risk of cardiovascular disease remains less than straightforward, partly because triglycerides are carried in lipoproteins of different atherogenicity, partly because hypertriglyceridemia is associated with non-lipid atherogenic and thrombogenic processes. For example, the association of highest risk of cardiovascular disease to moderate rather than to severe hypertriglyceridemia can be understood in terms of the distribution of triglycerides between different classes of plasma lipoproteins. It is counter-intuitive to most clinicians, however, and hence it can result in the misdirection of clinical efforts including drug therapy. Fibrates lower plasma triglycerides, and raise HDL, efficiently and with few immediate side-effects. Central to their mode of action is activation of certain nuclear receptors in cells. There is no necessary connection, however, between that fascinating biochemistry and clinical benefit as defined by reductions in rates of death by coronary artery disease. A review of trials of cholesterol-lowering by diet and drugs, published between 1966 and 1996, included 12 trials of therapy with fibrates or placebo in more than 21 000 patients. Overall, these trials indicated no benefit in terms of reduction in risk of coronary deaths. The period since 1996 has seen the publication of four additional trials of treatment of 6144 patients with fibrates or placebo. Two of them were major trials. The VA-HIT was very encouraging, because treatment with gemfibrozil produced a signficant reduction in the combined incidence of fatal and non-fatal coronary events. There was no significant reduction in coronary deaths, however. The results of BIP were frankly disappointing, because they demonstrated no significant effect of treatment with bezafibrate on either the primary end-point of the trial or on rates of coronary death. Clinical indications for the use of fibrates can obviously not be based on biochemical insights, however intriguing in their own right, but they have also not been satisfactorily defined by the randomized clinical trials published to date. Hope remains, however, that some clarification will result from ongoing trials of fibrate treatment of patients with type II diabetes.

In the revised guidelines of the European Joint Task Force for the prevention of CHD in clinical practice, these individuals remain the priority for prevention. The new guidelines have been formulated as a result of evidence from numerous epidemiological, observational and clinical trials and define specific goals of therapy for the management of lipids, blood pressure and diabetes. The intensity of lifestyle intervention and need for drug therapy should be determined by the absolute risk of a major ischemic event, based on an assessment of all risk factors. Implementation of these recommendations in clinical practice will ensure a common approach to CHD prevention throughout Europe and improve patients' quality of life. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Pub. H., Gothenburg, Sweden; Wedel, H., Aker Hospital, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) and other randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that cholesterol-lowering treatment with statins improves prognosis in patients with coronary atherosclerosis compared with placebo. The effect of therapy with statins beyond the typical 5 to 6 years' duration of the trials, in particular regarding the risk of cancer, has not been investigated. This study examines the long-term effects of simvastatin for up to 8 years on cause-specific mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). We performed an observational, government registry-based study of mortality in the groups originally randomized to simvastatin or placebo in the 4S over an additional 2-year follow-up period, so that the median total follow-up period was 7.4 years (range 6.9 to 8.3 in surviving patients). Randomization took place at outpatient clinics at 94 clinical centers in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from 1988 to 1989. Of 4,444 patients with CHD, 2,223 and 2,221 were randomized to treatment with placebo or simvastatin therapy, respectively. Patients received treatment with simvastatin, starting at 20 mg/day, with titration to 40 mg/day at 12 or 24 weeks if total cholesterol was >5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dl), or placebo. After the double-blind period, most patients in both treatment groups received simvastatin as open-label prescription. Of the 1,967 patients originally treated with placebo and surviving the double-blind period, 97 (4.9%) died during the following 2 years. In the group randomized to simvastatin the corresponding number was 74 of the 2,039 survivors (3.6%). Adding these deaths to those occurring during the original trial, the total was 353 (15.9%) and 256 (11.5%) deaths in the groups originally randomized to placebo and simvastatin, respectively. The relative risk was 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.82, p = 0.00002). The total number of cancer deaths was 68 (3.1%) in the placebo group and 52 (2.3%) in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.05, p = 0.087), and the numbers of noncardiovascular and other deaths were similar in both groups. We therefore conclude that treatment with simvastatin for up to 8 years in patients with CHD is safe and yields continued survival benefit.

Existing algorithms of risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) do not pertain to patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), whose arteries have been exposed to hypercholesterolaemia since birth. We studied a cohort of FH patients to compare four diagnostic models of CHD: traditional risk factors of CHD (age, sex, cholesterol, hypertension, smoking and body mass index), cholesterol year score, and aortic as well as coronary calcium measured by spiral computed tomography (CT). Subjects. We invited 88 individuals with molecularly defined FH of whom 80 (91%) decided to participate. Results. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the age-adjusted coronary calcium score was more strongly associated with clinical manifestations of CHD than were traditional risk factors (P < 0.002), cholesterol year score (P << 0.0001), and the age- adjusted aortic calcium score (P < 0.0004). Conclusions.

Medicine and Cardiology, Aarhus Amtssygehus Univ. Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark","Background - Carriers of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene are at a higher risk of coronary heart disease than individuals with other genotypes. We examined whether the risk of death or a major coronary event in survivors of myocardial infarction depended on apolipoprotein E genotype and whether the benefits of treatment with simvastatin differed between genotypes. Methods and Results - Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze 5.5 years of follow-up data from 966 Danish and Finnish myocardial infarction survivors enrolled in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. A total of 16% of the 166 ε4 carriers in the placebo group died compared with 9% of the 312 patients without the allele, which corresponds to a mortality risk ratio of 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.1). The risk ratio was unaffected by considerations of sex, age, concurrent angina, diabetes, smoking, and serum lipids in multivariate analyses. Simvastatin treatment reduced the mortality risk to 0.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.69) in ε4 carriers and to 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 1.24) in other patients (P=0.23 for treatment by genotype interaction). Apolipoprotein E genotype did not predict the risk of a major coronary event. Baseline serum levels of lipoprotein(a) also predicted mortality risk and could be combined with ε4-carrier status to define 3 groups of patients with different prognoses and benefits from treatment. Conclusions - Myocardial infarction survivors with the ε4 allele have a nearly 2-fold increased risk of dying compared with other patients, and the excess mortality can be abolished by treatment with simvastatin.","Apolipoproteins; Genetics; Mortality; Myocardial infarction; Prognosis","apolipoprotein E4; simvastatin; antilipemic agent; apolipoprotein E; apolipoprotein E4; simvastatin; adult; aged; allele; article; clinical trial; female; genotype; heart infarction; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; priority journal; prognosis; risk; survival; allele; follow up; genetics; heart infarction; middle aged; proportional hazards model; Adult; Aged; Alleles; Antilipemic Agents; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Simvastatin",,"simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Antilipemic Agents; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9",,,,"Rosenthal, N., Schwartz, R.S., In search of perverse polymorphisms (1998) N Engl J Med, 338, pp. 122-124; Davignon, J., Gregg, R.E., Sing, C.F., Apolipoprotein E polymorphism and atherosclerosis (1988) Arteriosclerosis, 8, pp. 1-21; Hixson, J.E., Apolipoprotein E polymorphism affect atherosclerosis in young males (1991) Arterioscler Thromb, 11, pp. 1237-1244; De Knijff, P., Havekes, L.M., Apolipoprotein E as a risk factor for coronary heart disease: A genetic and molecular biology approach (1996) Curr Opin Lipidol, 7, pp. 59-63; Wilson, P.W.F., Schaefer, E.J., Larson, M.G., Ordovas, J.M., Apolipoprotein E alleles and risk of coronary disease: A meta-analysis (1996) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 16, pp. 1250-1255; Köhler, E., Bentrup, A., Funke, H., Sandkamp, M., Schulte, H., Assmann, G., Untersuchungen zur beziehung zwischen Lipidstoffwechselstörungen und erstmanifestationsalter der koronaren herzkrankheit (KHK) (1992) Z Kardiol, 81, pp. 354-360; Eichner, J.E., Kuller, L.H., Orchard, T.J., Grandits, G.A., McCallum, L.M., Ferrell, R.E., Neaton, J.D., Relation of apolipoprotein E phenotype to myocardial infarction and mortality from coronary heart disease (1993) Am J Cardiol, 71, pp. 160-165; Lehtinen, S., Lehtimaki, T., Sisto, T., Salenius, J.P., Nikkila, M., Jokela, H., Koivula, T., Ehnholm, C., Apolipoprotein E polymorphism, serum lipids, myocardial infarction and severity of angiographically verified coronary artery disease in men and women (1995) Atherosclerosis, 114, pp. 83-91; Stengård, J.H., Zerba, K.E., Pekkanen, J., Ehnholm, C., Nissinen, A., Sing, C.F., Apolipoprotein E polymorphism predicts death from coronary heart disease in a longitudinal study of elderly Finnish men (1995) Circulation, 91, pp. 265-269; Wang, X.L., McCredie, R.M., Wilcken, D.E.L., Polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein E gene and severity of coronary artery disease defined by angiography (1995) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 15, pp. 1030-1034; Utermann, G., Apolipoprotein E polymorphism in health and disease (1987) Am Heart J, 113, pp. 433-440; Dallongeville, J., Lussier Cacan, S., Davignon, J., Modulation of plasma triglyceride levels by apoE phenotype: A meta-analysis (1992) J Lipid Res, 33, pp. 447-454; Weisgraber, K.H., Apolipoprotein E: Structure-function relationships (1994) Advances in Protein Chemistry, 45, pp. 249-302. , Schumaker VN, ed.

It was found that the W23X mutation significantly reduced LDL receptor expression and LDL binding and internalization, and that the W66G mutation significantly reduced LDL receptor expression and LDL binding. LDL internalization in patients heterozygous for the W66G mutation was not significantly reduced. The data support the concepts that the W23X mutation prevents production of LDL receptors (class I) and that the W66G mutation produces LDL receptors unable to recycle normally in cells (class V).","Atherosclerosis; Flow cytometry; Gene mutations; Hypercholesterolemia; LDL receptor activity; Lymphocytes","low density lipoprotein receptor; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; flow cytometry; gene mutation; human; internalization; lymphocyte activation; male; priority journal; protein expression; receptor binding; T lymphocyte; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Phenotype; Receptors, LDL; T-Lymphocytes; Variation (Genetics)",,"Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease, 7th Edn., pp. 1981-2030. , Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D, eds.

The full Task Force first met in November 1997 to review the original recommendations and agree on the principles for revision. The Writing Group then prepared a new draft of the recommendations and the specialist contributions of Professor Daan Kromhout (diet), Professor Kristina Orth-Gomér (socioeconomic, psychosocial factors and behavioural change), Professor Francois Cambien (genetics) and Dr Carlos Brotons (opportunities and barriers for coronary prevention) are gratefully acknowledged. This was submitted to a second Task Force meeting in April 1998 for approval. After this meeting the Writing Group prepared the final version of the recommendations and this was approved by the full Task Force in June. The expert advice of Professor Philip Home and Professor George Alberti on diabetes mellitus is gratefully acknowledged. The document was then approved by the ESC, EAS and ESH.

Molecular mutation detection allows identification of FDB but cannot characterize functionally mutations in the apoB gene. We present here a fluorescence flow cytometry assay to assess low density lipoprotein (LDL) ligand function. LDL was prepared from patients heterozygous for the Arg-GIn mutation in apoB-100 (n=21), relatives to the FDB patients without apoB gene mutations (n=23), and unrelated healthy individuals (n=24). Ebstein Ban- virus transformed lymphoblasts from a normolipidemic individual were incubated at 37°C either with pure LDL prepared from one of the study subjects, pure fluorescently conjugated LDL (Dil-LDL), or a 3:1 mixture of LDL and Dil-LDL. Fluorescence of Dil-LDL bound to and internalized by lymphoblasts was measured by flow cytometry. The ability of LDL to compete with Dil-LDL in binding to LDL receptors mirrored LDL ligand function. Knowing the apoB genotype of the FDB patients and relatives allowed us to compare the diagnostic capability of our functional assay with DNA diagnosis. Fluorescence was significantly increased for cells incubated with Dil-LDL and LDL from FDB patients (p &lt; 0.0001). Fluorescence for cells incubated with Dil-LDL and LDL from relatives and the unrelated healthy did not differ. Diagnostic sensitivity was 0.95 and diagnostic specificity was 0.89. We conclude that (1) the Arg3500 mutation significantly reduces LDL ligand function, and (2) the diagnostic accuracy of the assay is too low to allow reliable diagnosis of individual cases of heterozygous FDB. We suggest that fluorescence flow cytometry (1) can supplement the genetic identification of FDB and (2) can be used to characterize functionally gene mutations causing major reduction in LDL ligand function.",,,,,,,,,"Raunyaarcf, B.; Department of Medicine and Cardiology, Aarhus Amtssygehus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark",,,,,,,,14017458,,SCJSF,,"English","Scand.

In two Danish families, carriers of the 1592+5G→A mutation display a clinical phenotype ranging from healthy normocholesterolemic persons to classical heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of RNA from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts obtained from members of both families demonstrated abnormal splicing generating two aberrant mRNAs due to either alternative splicing and skipping of exon 10 or activation of a cryptic splice site in intron 10 inserting 66 intronic base pairs. These abnormally spliced mRNAs were predicted to encode two abnormal receptor proteins containing an in-frame deletion of 75 amino acids and an insertion of 22 novel amino acids, respectively. Results obtained by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy of transfected Chang and COS-7 cells expressing normal and mutant LDL receptors were compatible with nearly complete retention of the mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Quantitative measurements of LDL receptor mRNAs from EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, however, did not reveal any significant differences in variant mRNA contents between mutation carriers in the families that could be related to degree of hypercholesterolemia.","Familial hypercholesterolemia; Genotype; Low-density lipoprotein receptor; Phenotype; Splice donor mutations","low density lipoprotein receptor; adult; alternative RNA splicing; article; case report; confocal microscopy; Denmark; endoplasmic reticulum; Epstein Barr virus; exon; familial hypercholesterolemia; flow cytometry; gene insertion; gene mutation; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; intron; male; nucleic acid base substitution; phenotype; priority journal; receptor gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus cell transformation; Adult; Animals; Cell Line; DNA Mutational Analysis; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Lipids; Male; Microscopy, Confocal; Pedigree; Point Mutation; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Receptors, LDL; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Splicing; Transfection; Human herpesvirus 4",,"Lipids; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease, 7th Edition, pp. 1981-2030. , Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D, eds.

Hospital, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Most studies of the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease occur between gene variants and biochemical or physiological variables known to be atherogenic. In many situations, however, the gene products are not necessarily known. We studied 17 families (n = 122) with mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene as a model in which to test formally for linkage directly between an atherogenic genotype and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or aorto-coronary calcified atherosclerosis. In each family one of three different mutations was found: the Trp66 Gly mutation, the Trp23 Stop mutation, or a ten kilobase deletion removing exons 3-6 of the LDL receptor gene. Genomic DNA was used to determine these mutations by either enzymatic cleavage assays or Southern blotting. Aorto-coronary calcification was significantly associated with age and plasma cholesterol. Sex, hypertension, BMI and smoking were not associated with aorto-coronary calcification. Nonparametric analysis indicated significant linkage of the LDL receptor gene locus to aortic (p &lt; 0.00005) and to aorto-coronary calcified atherosclerosis (p &lt; 0.00001). Assuming a dominant mode of inheritance, significant linkage was detected for aortic (LOD = 3.89) and aorto-coronary calcified atherosclerosis (LOD = 4.10). We suggest that the atherogenicity of variations in other genes could be assessed by a similar approach.",,"low density lipoprotein receptor; adult; age; aged; aorta atherosclerosis; article; assay; blood vessel calcification; body mass; cholesterol blood level; coronary artery atherosclerosis; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; gene mutation; genetic linkage; genotype; human; major clinical study; male; model; priority journal; receptor gene; sex difference; smoking; Southern blotting; statistical analysis; stop codon; Adult; Aortic Diseases; Arteriosclerosis; Calcinosis; Cardiomyopathies; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Female; Genotype; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Linkage (Genetics); Male; Middle Aged; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Receptors, LDL",,"Receptors, LDL",,,,"Appleyard, M., Hansen, A.T., Jensen, G., Schnohr, P., Nyboe, J., The Copenhagen City Heart Study.

Hosp., T., Aarhus, Denmark","Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common potentially fatal single-gene diseases leading to premature coronary artery disease, but the majority of heterozygous FH patients have not been diagnosed. FH is due to mutations in the gene coding for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and molecular genetic diagnosis may facilitate identification of more FH subjects. The Danish spectrum of 29 different mutations, five of which account for almost half of heterozygous FH, is intermediate between that of countries such as South Africa, where three mutations cause 95% of heterozygous FH in the Afrikaners, and Germany or England, where there are many more mutations. In clinical practice, a strategy for the genetic diagnosis of heterozygous FH, tailored to the mutational spectrum of patients likely to be seen at the particular hospital/region of the country, will be more efficient than screening of the whole LDL receptor gene by techniques such as single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in every heterozygous FH candidate. In Aarhus, Denmark, we have chosen to examine all heterozygous FH candidates for the five most common LDL receptor gene mutations (W23X, W66G, W556S, 313+1G→A, 1846-1G→A) and the apoB-3500 mutation by rapid restriction fragment analysis. Negative samples are examined for other mutations by SSCP analysis followed by DNA sequencing of the exon indicated by SSCP to contain a mutation. If no point mutation or small insertion/deletion is detected, Southern blot or Long PCR analysis is performed to look for the presence of large gene rearrangements. In conclusion, our data suggest that an efficient molecular diagnostic strategy depends on the composition of common and rare mutations in a population.

Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark","Background: Studies indicate that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells mirror low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity of other cells in the body. To measure LDL receptor activity in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), we prepared peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with molecularly verified LDL receptor defective (TrpC66-Gly mutation, n = 18) or receptor negative (Trp23-stop mutation, n = 17) heterozygous FH and from healthy individuals (n = 24). Methods: The cells were stimulated to express maximum LDL receptor by preincubation in lipoprotein-free medium. They were then incubated at 4°or 37°C with fluorescently conjugated LDL (DiI-LDL). T-lymphocytes and monocytes were identified by fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies. DiI-LDL bound (at 4°C) or internalized (at 37°C) by the cells was measured using flow cytometry. Knowing the LDL receptor gene mutation of the FH patients allowed us to compare the diagnostic capability of our functional assay with the DNA diagnosis. Results: The diagnostic accuracy did not allow our assay to be used for diagnosis of individual cases of heterozygous FH. Conclusions: We suggest that our two-color fluorescence flow cytometry assay can be used to characterize functionally gene mutations causing LDL receptor dysfunction in patients with heterozygous FH.","Arteriosclerosis; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Flow cytometry; Fluorescence; Low density lipoproteins; Lymphocytes; Membrane proteins; Monocytes","low density lipoprotein receptor; article; clinical article; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; familial hypercholesterolemia; flow cytometry; gene mutation; heterozygosity; human; mononuclear cell; priority journal; protein localization; receptor density; Arteriosclerosis; DNA Mutational Analysis; Family Health; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Monocytes; Point Mutation; Receptors, LDL; Sensitivity and Specificity; T-Lymphocytes",,"Receptors, LDL","FACSort flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson, Belgium","Becton Dickinson, Belgium",,"Andersen, G.E., Lous, P., Friis-Hansen, B., Screening for hyperlipoproteinemia in 10,000 danish newborns.

It has been demonstrated that there is an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in heterozygous FH subjects, although this excess CHD is not only explained by the LDL-cholesterol concentration or the class of the LDL-receptor mutation. To investigate if a common polymorphism at the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa gene locus could be related to CHD phenotypic variation in heterozygous FH, we have carried out a case-control study. We have studied 40 cases and 40 controls matched for age, sex and genetic defect in the LDL-receptor gene. Allele frequency of P1(A2) polymorphism for cases and controls was 20 and 22.5%, respectively, and the difference was not significant. In conclusion, our data do not support any association between the GP IIIa polymorphism and the increased prevalence of acute coronary syndromes in the heterozygous FH subjects.","Coronary heart disease; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Glycoprotein IIIa polymorphism; LDL receptor mutation","glycoprotein iiia; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein receptor; fibrinogen receptor; low density lipoprotein receptor; adult; article; cardiovascular disease; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery disease; coronary risk; familial disease; familial hypercholesterolemia; female; gene mutation; genetic polymorphism; human; hypercholesterolemia; male; priority journal; acute disease; allele; case control study; coronary artery disease; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genotype; hyperlipoproteinemia type 2; middle aged; point mutation; restriction fragment length polymorphism; risk factor; Acute Disease; Alleles; Case-Control Studies; Coronary Disease; Female; Genotype; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Middle Aged; Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex; Point Mutation; Polymorphism, Genetic; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Receptors, LDL; Risk Factors",,"Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease 7th Edn, p. 1981. , C.R.

However, surveys such as EUROASPIRE have shown that treatment guidelines are not always used and that many coronary patients are not reaching their LDL-C goals. There are several reasons that may explain this current under-use of treatment guidelines. For example, physicians may not follow them because of difficulties in extrapolating clinical trial data to complex patients in practice, lack of involvement in the consensus process, or lack of opportunity to evaluate and adapt guidelines to local practice. Mixed messages arising from multiple sets of guidelines may deter physicians from using them. In addition, there are several barriers to the implementation of good CHD treatment and prevention guidelines, over which individual physicians have little control. These include cultural barriers and a number of economic issues. It is important to understand why current treatment guidelines in the prevention of CHD are not being followed so that these issues can be resolved. Treatment guidelines must be simple and consistent to prevent confusion, and barriers such as cost, which prevent physicians from prescribing effective treatments, must be addressed. Revised recommendations fur the prevention of CHD in clinical practice have recently been developed by the EAS, the European Society of Cardiology, the European Society of Hypertension, the European Society of General Practice/Family Medicine and the International Society of Behavioural Medicine. These guidelines are simple, consistent with scientific evidence and are fiscally responsible.","CHD; Guidelines; LDL-C; Statins","low density lipoprotein cholesterol; conference paper; coronary risk; ischemic heart disease; practice guideline; priority journal",,,,,,,"Faergeman, O.; Aarhus Amstssygehus, University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,,,,,,,1520765X,,EHJSF,,"English","Eur.

Continually revised and broadly disseminated since then, CHD guidelines have become increasingly based on evidence derived from several fields of medical science including prospective clinical trials. All CHD guidelines emphasise a healthy lifestyle and the judicious use of drugs, and the focus now is on the cost of, and barriers to, the implementation of internationally adopted CHD guidelines, and on methods by which to make them acceptable and useful at national and local levels.

To assess differences in treatment of ischaemic heart disease in the Scandinavian countries. Methods and Results. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) lasted 5.4 years and showed that death rates in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease were 30% lower in those treated with simvastatin to lower serum cholesterol than in those given placebo. Apart from this main result, the 4S provided detailed information on rates of death and other manifestations of coronary heart disease, as well as on use of non-lipid forms of therapy. There were substantial differences in 4S placebo group rates of mortality, corollary deaths and major coronary events between countries. Surgical and medical therapy varied importantly between countries. Conclusions. Major inter-country differences in rates of death and myocardial infarction in patients with coronary heart disease were likely to be due to a composite of differences in baseline characteristics including smoking. They occurred in a setting of very uneven exploitation of the potential for improving survival of patients with ischaemic heart disease.","Beta-blockade; Calcium channel blockers; Cholesterol; Coronary heart disease; Medical technology; Revascularization; Smoking","cholesterol; simvastatin; article; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; denmark; female; finland; human; iceland; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; mortality; norway; priority journal; scandinavia; sweden; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anticholesteremic Agents; Aspirin; Calcium Channel Blockers; Cause of Death; Coronary Disease; Female; Finland; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Iceland; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Revascularization; Prognosis; Scandinavia; Simvastatin; Survival Rate; Warfarin",,"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anticholesteremic Agents; Aspirin, 50-78-2; Calcium Channel Blockers; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Warfarin, 81-81-2",,,,"Pyörälä, K., De Backer, G., Poole-Wilson, P., Wood, D., Prevention of coronary heart disease in clinical practice (1994) Eur Heart J, 15, pp. 1300-1331; Shepherd, J., Pratt, M., Prevention of coronary heart disease in clinical practice: A commentary on current treatment patterns in six European countries in relation to published recommendations (1996) Cardiology, 87, pp. 1-5; Troein, M., Gardell, B., Selander, S., Råstam, L., Guidelines and reported practice for the treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia (1997) J Int Med, 242, pp. 173-178; Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1383-1389; Kjekshus, J., Pedersen, T.R., Reducing the risk of coronary events: Evidence from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1995) Am J Cardiol, 76, pp. 64C-68C; Holm, S., A simple sequentially rejective multiple test procedure (1979) Scand J Statis, 6, pp. 65-70; Randomised trial of intravenous streptokinase, oral aspirin, both, or neither among 17,187 cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction (1988) Lancet, 2, pp. 349-360; Yusuf, S., Peto, R., Lewis, J., Collins, R., Sleight, P., Beta blockade during and after myocardial infarction: An overview of the randomized trials (1985) Prog Cardiovasc Dis, 27, pp. 335-371; Smith, P., Arnesen, H., Holme, I., The effect of warfarin on mortality and reinfarction after myocardial infarction (1990) N Engl J Med, 323, pp. 147-152; Pfeffer, M.A., Braunwald, E., Moye, L.A., Effect of captopril on mortality and morbidity in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.

We prepared peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with genetically verified LDL receptor- defective (Trp66-Gly mutation, n = 17) or receptor-negative (Trp23-stop mutation, n = 17) heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and from healthy individuals (n = 24). The cells were stimulated to express the maximum amount of LDL receptor by preincubation in lipoprotein-deficient medium. A dual-labeling technique allowed flow cytometric analysis of LDL receptor expression on cells identified by fluorescently conjugated surface marker antibodies. Knowing the LDL receptor gene mutation of the FH patients allowed us to compare the diagnostic capability of this functional assay with the DNA diagnosis and to validate the assay with molecular genetics instead of clinical indices of heterozygous FH. T lymphocytes expressed more LDL receptors and gave better diagnostic results than monocytes, and cells from patients with either the Trp66-Gly or the Trp23-stop mutation had variable but significantly reduced LDL receptor expression. The data indicate that this fluorescence flow cytometry assay is unsuitable for diagnosis of individual cases of heterozygous FH but that it may be useful for functionally characterizing mutations in the LDL receptor gene.",,"low density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein receptor; lymphocyte surface marker; monoclonal antibody; article; clinical article; controlled study; familial hypercholesterolemia; flow cytometry; gene mutation; genetic analysis; heterozygosity; human; human cell; human tissue; lipoprotein deficiency; monocyte; t lymphocyte; Amino Acid Substitution; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cell Count; DNA Mutational Analysis; Flow Cytometry; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Lymphocyte Activation; Monocytes; Mutation; Receptors, LDL; Reproducibility of Results; T-Lymphocytes",,"Antibodies, Monoclonal; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease, 7th Ed., pp. 1981-2030. , Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D, eds.

Over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years, one or more major coronary events (MCEs) occurred in 622 (28%) of the 2223 patients in the placebo group and 431 (19%) of the 2221 patients in the simvastatin group (34% risk reduction, P<.00001). Simvastatin produced substantial changes in several lipoprotein components, which we have attempted to relate to the beneficial effects observed. Methods and Results - The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between lipid values (baseline, year 1, and percent change from baseline at year 1) and MCEs. The reduction in MCEs within the simvastatin group was highly correlated with on-treatment levels and changes from baseline in total and LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and less so with HDL cholesterol, but there was no clear relationship with triglycerides. We estimate that each additional 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol reduces MCE risk by 1.7% (95% CI, 1.0% to 2.4%; P<.00001). Conclusions - These analyses suggest that the beneficial effect of simvastatin in individual patients in 4S was determined mainly by the magnitude of the change in LDL cholesterol, and they are consistent with current guidelines that emphasize aggressive reduction of this lipid in CHD patients.","Cholesterol; Coronary disease; Lipoproteins; Simvastatin","simvastatin; adult; aged; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug effect; female; human; ischemic heart disease; lipoprotein blood level; major clinical study; male; practice guideline; primary prevention; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; risk management; secondary prevention; treatment outcome; triacylglycerol blood level; Adult; Aged; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, Dietary; Coronary Disease; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Predictive Value of Tests; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Simvastatin; Triglycerides",,"Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, Dietary; Lipoproteins; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Triglycerides",,,,"Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1383-1389; Pedersen, T.R., Berg, K., Cook, T.J., Faergeman, O., Haghfelt, T., Kjekshus, J., Miettinen, T., Wilhelmsen, L., Safety and tolerability of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin during 5 years in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (1996) Arch Intern Med, 156, pp. 2085-2092; Baseline serum cholesterol and treatment effect in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1995) Lancet, 345, pp. 1274-1275; Kjekshus, J., Pedersen, T.R., Reducing the risk of coronary events: Evidence from 4S (1995) Am J Cardiol, 76, pp. 64C-68C; Friedewald, W.T., Levy, R.I., Fredrickson, D.S., Estimation of the concentration of low-density lipoprotein in plasma, without use of the preparative ultracentrifuge (1972) Clin Chem, 18, pp. 499-502; Wolfe, R.A., Strawderman, R.L., Logical and statistical fallacies in the use of Cox regression models (1996) Am J Kidney Dis, 27, pp. 124-129; The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial results, II: The relationship of reduction in incidence of coronary heart disease to cholesterol lowering (1984) JAMA, 251, pp. 365-374; Manninen, V., Elo, M.O., Frick, M.H., Haapa, K., Heinonen, O.P., Heinsalmi, P., Helo, P., Nikkilä, E.A., Lipid alterations and decline in the incidence of coronary heart disease in the Helsinki Heart Study (1988) JAMA, 260, pp. 641-651; Pyörälä, K., De Backer, G., Graham, I., Poole-Wilson, P., Wood, D., Prevention of coronary heart disease in clinical practice: Recommendations of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology.

The present study provides a detailed, post hoc assessment of the efficacy and safety of simvastatin therapy in the following subgroups of 4S patients: those ≤65 years of age, those <65 years of age, women, and men. Methods and Results: The 4S cohort of 4444 CHD patients included 827 women and 1021 patients ≤65 years of age. Total cholesterol at baseline was 5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L with triglycerides ≤2.5 mmol/L. Patients were randomized to therapy with simvastatin 20 to 40 mg daily or placebo for a median follow-up period of 5.4 years. End points consisted of all-cause and CHD mortality, major coronary events (primarily CHD death and nonfatal myocardial infarction), other acute CHD and atherosclerotic events, hospitalizations for CHD and cardiovascular events, and coronary revascularization procedures. Mean changes in serum lipids were similar in the different subgroups. In patients ≤65 years of age in the simvastatin group, relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for clinical events were as follows: all-cause mortality, 0.66 (0.48 to 0.90); CHD mortality, 0.57 (0.39 to 0.83); major coronary events, 0.66 (0.52 to 0.84); any atherosclerosis-related event, 0.67 (036 to 0.81); and revascularization procedures, 0.59 (0.41 to 0.84). In women, the corresponding figures were 1.16 (0.68 to 1.99); 0.86 (0.42 to 1.74), 0.66 (0.48 to 0.91), 0.71 (0.56 to 0.91), and 0.51 (0.30 to 0.86), respectively. Conclusion: Cholesterol lowering with simvastatin produced similar reductions in relative risk for major coronary events in women compared with men and in elderly (≤65 years of age) compared with younger patients. There were too few female deaths to assess the effects on mortality in women. Because mortality rates increased substantially with age, the absolute risk reduction for both all-cause and CHD mortality in simvastatin-treated subjects was approximately twice as great in the older patients.","Coronary disease; Hypercholesterolemia; Mortality; Simvastatin","cholesterol; placebo; simvastatin; adult; aged; angina pectoris; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; controlled study; coronary risk; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; human; hypercholesterolemia; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; mortality; priority journal; risk management; scandinavia; sex difference; Adult; Aged; Aging; Angina Pectoris; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cohort Studies; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Myocardial Infarction; Simvastatin; Survival Analysis",,"Anticholesteremic Agents; Lipids; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9",,,,"Manolio, A.T., Pearson, A.T., Wenger, N.K., Barrett-Connor, E., Payne, G.H., Harlan, W.R., Cholesterol and heart disease in older persons and women: Review of an NHLBI workshop (1992) Am Epidemiol, 3, pp. 2161-2176; Garber, A.M., Littenberg, B., Sox H.C., Jr., Gluck, M.E., Wagner, J.L., Duffy, B.M., (1989) Costs and Effectiveness of Cholesterol Screening in the Elderly, , Washington DC: Health Program, Office of Technology Assessment, Congress of the United States; April.

The cells were stimulated to express maximum amounts of LDL receptor by preincubation in human lipoprotein deficient serum for 48 hours. Aliquots of the cells were labelled with a monoclonal LDL receptor specific antibody (C7-MAB) and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Control cell aliquots were labelled with FITC only to determine the non specific binding of this probe. To identify the lymphocyte and monocyte populations, we labelled cell aliquots with lymphocyte or monocyte specific, R-phycoerythrin (RPE) conjugated monoclonal antibody (CD3-RPE or CD14-RPE), respectively. By flow cytometry we determined the size and density of individual cells and measured the intensity of the fluorescent signal of RPE to separate a &gt; 99% pure lymphocyte or monocyte population. A relative quantification of C7-MAB bound to the lymphocytes or monocytes was expressed as the ratio between the median for the fluorescence signal of C7-FITC labelled cells and the median for the fluorescence signal of FITC labelled cells (C7-FITC/FITC ratio). We found that the C7-FITC/FITC ratio for healthy individuals &gt; receptor defective HeFH patients &gt; receptor negative HeFH patients (p &lt; 0.001 (lymphocytes), p &lt; 0.01 (monocytes)). We conclude that in our assay: (1) Patients heterozygous for the Trp23-stop mutation have significantly reduced LDL receptor expression; (2) HeFH patients with a receptor defective (Trp66-Gly) mutation express less LDL receptor, than healthy individuals; (3) Lymphocytes provide better differentiation between groups than monocytes.

Methods and Results: In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, 4444 patients with coronary heart disease without evidence of heart failure were randomized to placebo (n = 2223) or simvastatin 20-40 mg (n = 2221) and followed for more than 5 years. Among the patients who received placebo, 228 (10.3%) were diagnosed with heart failure during follow-up evaluation compared with 184 (8.3%) of patients who received simvastatin (P < .015). Mortality was 31.9% in the placebo group and 25.5% in the simvastatin group among patients who developed heart failure. These compare with 9.2 and 6.6%, respectively, among non-heart failure patients. There were 45 hospitalizations because of acute heart failure in the placebo group and 23 in the simvastatin group (NS). Patients who developed heart failure were more likely to have suffered a recurrent myocardial infarction and have a history of diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension than patients who did not develop congestive heart failure. Conclusion: Long-term prevention with simvastatin reduces the occurrence of heart failure in a cohort of patients with coronary heart disease without previous evidence of congestive heart failure.","Congestive heart failure; Coronary heart disease; Lipid lowering; Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study; Simvastatin","hypocholesterolemic agent; simvastatin; adult; aged; article; clinical trial; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; disease course; human; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; survival; Adult; Aged; Anticholesteremic Agents; Coronary Disease; Disease Progression; Heart Failure, Congestive; Humans; Middle Aged; Multicenter Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials; Retrospective Studies; Simvastatin; Survival Analysis",,"Anticholesteremic Agents; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9",,,,"Effects of enalapril on mortality in severe congestive heart failure: Results of the cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (Consensus) (1987) N Engl J Med, 316, pp. 1429-1435; Lystash, J.C., Gibson, R.S., Watson, D.D., Beller, G.A., Early versus late congestive heart failure after initially uncomplicated anterior wall acute myocardial infarction (1995) Am J Cardiol, 75, pp. 653-658; Brown, B.G., Zhao, Z.-A., Samo, D.E., Albers, H., Arteriographic view of treatment to achieve regression of coronary atherosclerosis and to prevent plaque disruption and clinical cardiovascular events (1993) Br Heart J, 69, pp. 848-853; Fuster, V., Mechanisms leading to myocardial infarction: Insights from studies of vascular biology (1994) Circulation, 90, pp. 2126-2146; Meredith, I.T., Yeung, A.C., Weidinger, F.F., Anderson, T.J., Uehata, A., Ryan, T.J., Selwyn, A.P., Ganz, P., Role of impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in ischemic manifestations of coronary artery disease (1993) Circulation, 87, pp. V56-V66; Randomized trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1383-1389; Design and baseline results of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study of patients with stable angina and/or myocardial infarction (1993) Am J Cardiol, 71, pp. 393-400; Kjekshus, J., Pedersen, T.R., Reducing the risk of coronary event: Evidence from 4S (1995) Am J Cardiol, 76, pp. 63c-68c; Shepherd, J., Cobbe, S.M., Ford, I., Isles, C.G., Lorimar, A.R., MacFarlane, P.W., McKillop, J.H., Palcard, C.J., Prevention of coronary heart disease with pravastatin in men with hypercholesterolemia (1995) N Engl J Med, 333, pp. 1301-1307; Sacks, F.M., Pfeffer, M.A., Moye, L., Rouleau, J.L., Rutherford, J.D., Cole, T.G., Brown, L., Braunwald, E., The effect of pravas-tatin on coronary events after myocardial infarction in patients with average cholesterol levels (1996) N Engl J Med, 335, pp. 1001-1009; Effect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure (1991) N Engl J Med, 325, pp. 293-302; Swedberg, K., Kjekshus, J., Effects of enalapril on mortality in severe congestive heart failure.

Hospital, Tage Hansensgade 2, DK-8000 C Aarhus, Denmark","Background: Variations at the DNA level with moderate effects on biochemical variables may be important for the occurrence of disease at the population level, if they are common. Two mutations in the LPL gene, N9 and S291, are associated with variation in fasting plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). We investigated whether these mutants were more frequent in offspring of cases with premature coronary disease and analyzed the effects on fasting plasma lipids and postprandial TG. Methods and Results: Students with and without paternal history of myocardial infarction (cases and control subjects [controls]) were studied in the European Atherosclerosis Research Studies I and II (EARS-I and -II). Allelic frequencies for the N9 and S291 mutations did not differ between cases and control subjects. The N9 mutation was identified in 4.2% of all subjects in EARS-I, and carriers had higher fasting TG levels (P<.001) than noncarriers. In an oral fat tolerance test, therewere no differences in postprandial TG between carriers and noncarriers of the N9 allele. The S291 mutation was identified in 3.1% of all subjects in EARS-I, and carriers had lower fasting HDL-C levels (P<.005) than noncarriers. There was a significant interaction between S291 genotype and body mass index on fasting TG levels (P<.01). In the cases, carriers of the S291 allele had higher TG levels 6 hours postprandially (P<.04) than did noncarriers. Conclusions: The two LPL mutations are common and may predispose to elevated TG and decreased HDL-C concentrations, even in young subjects. In the case of the S291 mutation, this effect appears to be mediated via delayed postprandial TG clearance. Moreover, even moderate obesity potentiates the TG-raising and HDL-lowering effects associated with the S291 allele.","EARS Group; Epidemiology; Genetics; Obesity; Postprandial lipemia","apolipoprotein a1;

We conducted a nested case-control (prospective) study of five cohorts of white men: The 1936 cohort (baseline 1976, n = 548) and four cohorts from MONICA I born in 1923 (n = 463), 1933 (n = 491), 1943 (n = 504) and 1953 (n = 448) studied at baseline in 1983. At follow up in 1991, 52 subjects had developed a first myocardial infarction and 22 had been hospitalized with angina pectoris. Plasma samples obtained at baseline were stored frozen until 1993-94, when case samples (n = 74) were analyzed together with samples from matched (disease free) controls (n = 190). In a statistical model (conditional logistic regression) including all age groups, cholesterol (or apo B) level (P < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (P = 0.05) and smoking (P = 0.02) predicted CHD. In the statistical model Lp(a) interacted significantly with age (OR = 5.7: 95% CI: 1.4-23.6; P = 0.016), and high Lp(a) (over 45 mg/dl) was associated with significantly increased risk in subjects under 60 years (OR = 3.82; 95% CI: 1.47-9.96), but not in older men (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.235-1.89). Therefore, we studied the impact of Lp(a)/apo(a) and other variables in subjects who had been under 60 years when they became cases. Among the younger subjects the presence of LMW apo(a) isoforms significantly predicted the development of CHD (OR = 3.83; 95% CI: 1.18-12.4). The increased risk pertained to high Lp(a) (above versus below 45 mg/dl: OR = 3.68; 95% CI: 1.03-13.100 and to Lp(a) concentrations when entered into the model as a continuous variable (P = 0.04). Cholesterol or apo B (P < 0.01), smoking (P = 0.02), systolic blood pressure (P = 0.05) and low alcohol consumption (under nine drinks/week) (P = 0.04) were also significant predictors of CHD. We conclude that LMW apo(a) isoforms are significantly associated with increased risk of CHD in men under 60 years.","Apolipoprotein B; Apolipoprotein(a); Cholesterol; Coronary heart disease; Lipoprotein(a); Myocardial infarction","apolipoprotein a; apolipoprotein b; adult; aged; angina pectoris; article; case control study; cholesterol blood level; chromosome 6; cohort analysis; coronary artery disease; dna polymorphism; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; genetic susceptibility; heart infarction; human; lipoprotein metabolism; major clinical study; male; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Apolipoproteins; Apoprotein(a); Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Coronary Disease; Denmark; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Hypertension; Lipids; Lipoprotein(a); Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Weight; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Smoking",,"Apolipoproteins; Apoprotein(a), EC 3.4.21.-; Lipids; Lipoprotein(a)",,,,"Renninger, W., Wendt, G.G., Nawrocki, P., Weigand, H., Beitrag zur Problematik des Lp-systems (1965) Humangenetik, 1, pp. 658-667; Berg, K., Dahlen, G., Lp(a) lipoprotein and pre-beta-lipoprotein in patients with coronary heart disease (1974) Clin Genet, 6, pp. 230-235. , MH; Rhoads, G.G., Dahlen, G., Berg, K., Morton, N.E., Dannenberg, A.L., Lp(a) lipoprotein as a risk factor for myocardial infarction (1986) JAMA, 256, pp. 2540-2544; Sandkamp, M., Funke, H., Schulte, H., Kohler, E., Assmann, G., Lipoprotein(a) is an independent risk factorfor myocardial infarction at a young age (1990) Clin Chem, 36, pp. 20-23; Armstrong, V.W., Cremer, P., Eberle, E., Manke, A., Schulze, F., Wieland Kreuzer, H., Seidel, D., The association between serum Lp(a) concentrations and angiographically assessed coronary atherosclerosis (1986) Atherosclerosis, 62, pp. 249-257; Kostner, G., Avogaro, P., Cazzalato, G., Marth, E., Bittolo-Bon, G., Qunici, G.B., Lipoprotein Lp(a) and the risk for myocardial infarction (1981) Atherosclerosis, 38, pp. 51-61; Sandholzer, C., Saha, N., Kark, J.D., Rees, A., Jaross, W., Dieplinger, H., Hoppichler, F., Utermann, G., Apo(a) isoforms predict risk for coronary heart disease.

Expression of mutant genes in cells can therefore be required to demonstrate that mutations in fact disturb protein function. This applies especially to missense mutations, which cause an amino acid to be replaced by another amino acid. In the present study of two families with familial hypercholesterolemia in the heterozygous form, we found two mutations in the same allele of the low- density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene: a missense Asn543. His mutation (N543H) in exon 11, and an in-frame 9-bp deletion (2393del9) in exon 17. The two mutations were identified in heterozygous FH index patients in whom no other pathogenic mutations were detected by SSCP analysis of the remaining 16 exons and the promoter region. Both mutations cosegregated with hypercholesterolemia within the families. Each of these mutations had little or no effect on receptor function in transfected COS cells, but when both mutations were present simultaneously, receptor function, as assessed by flow cytometric measurement of fluorescent LDL uptake in cells, was reduced by 75%. Immunostainable receptors on the cell surface were decreased by 80% as measured by flow cytometry. The two mutations therefore acted in synergy to affect receptor function, possibly during intracellular receptor transport, since Northern blot analysis suggested that mRNA levels were unaffected. Without screening of the entire coding regions of the gene, the synergistic action of these two LDL receptor mutations would not have been detected.","familial hypercholesterolemia; genetics; mutations; SSCP analysis; transfection","low density lipoprotein receptor; messenger rna; animal cell; article; autosomal dominant inheritance; clinical feature; dna sequence; familial hypercholesterolemia; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene mutation; heterozygosity; human; major clinical study; missense mutation; molecular cloning; nonhuman; northern blotting; pedigree; priority journal; receptor gene; single strand conformation polymorphism; Alleles; Animals; COS Cells; Female; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Receptors, LDL; Sequence Deletion; Animalia",,"Receptors, LDL",,,,"Ainsworth, P.J., Coulter-Mackie, M.B., A double mutation in exon 6 of the β-hexosaminidase subunit in a patient with the BI variant of Tay-Sachs Disease (1992) Am J Hum Genet, 51, pp. 802-809; Beisiegel, U., Schneider, W.J., Brown, M.S., Goldstein, J.L., Immunoblot analysis of low density lipoprotein receptors in fibroblasts from subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (1982) J Biol Chem, 257, pp. 13150-13156; Brody, L.C., Mitchell, G.A., Obie, C., Michard, J., Steel, G., Fontaine, G., Robert, M.-F., Valle, D., Orthinine δ-aminotransferase mutations in gyrate atrophy (1992) J Biol Chem, 267, pp. 3302-3307; Chomczynski, P., Sacchi, N., Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-choloroform extraction (1987) Anal Biochem, 162, pp. 156-159; Fourney, R.M., Miyakoshi, J., Day III, R.S., Paterson, M.C., Northern blotting: Efficient RNA staining and transfer (1988) Focus (Gibco BRL), 10, pp. 5-7; Friedewald, W.T., Levy, F.I., Fredrickson, D.S., Estimation of the concentration of the low density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma without use af the preparative ultracentrifuge (1972) Clin Chem, 18, pp. 499-509; Goldfarb, L.G., Petersen, R.B., Tabaton, M., Brown, P., LeBlanc, A.C., Montagna, P., Cortelli, P., Gambetti, P., Fatal familial insomnia and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Disease phenotype determined by a DNA polymorphism (1992) Science, 258, pp. 806-807","Jensen, H.K.; Center for Medical Molecular Biology, Skejby Sygehus University Hospital, DK-8000 Arhus C, Denmark",,,,,,,,10597794,,HUMUE,9143924,"English","HUM.

The associated clinical syndrome has been named familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB). In 205 FDB patients from Germany (n=73). The Netherlands (n=87), and Denmark (n=45), we tried to assess determinants of variation in lipid concentrations. Besides age, sex, and geographic origin, variation in the LDLR gene was the most powerful determinant of variation in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. Polymorphic variation in the LDLR gene (SfaNI, exon 2; Nco 1, exon 18) was associated with total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) variation in women (SfaNI: P=.04 and .03 for TC and LDL-C, respectively; Nco I: P=.003 and .006, respectively), whereas the Ava II (exon 13) and the Pvu II (intron 15) polymorphisms were not. Combined information from all three LDLR exon polymorphisms showed that subjects with at least one S+A+N+ allele had 13% to 20% higher TC than non-S+A+N+ subjects (P=.02 [TC, men]; P=.01 [LDL-C, men]; P=.005 [TC, women]; and P=.004 [LDL-C, women]) and, together with age and geographic origin, accounted for 20% (women) and 19% (men) of the variation in LDL-C. The expected association of the apo E genotypes (e 3e 2, e 3e 3, and e 3e 4) with cholesterol concentrations was seen in S+A+N+ but not in non-S+A+N+ subjects and in P-P- but not in P+P+ or P+P- subjects. With regard to clinical expression, FDB patients had lower TC and LDL-C levels and a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease than 101 Danish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.","apolipoprotein B;

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A post hoc subgroup analysis was carried out on data from 202 diabetic patients and 4,242 nondiabetic patients with previous myocardial infarction or angina pectoris, serum total cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/l, and serum triglycerides ≤2.5 mmol/l who were participating in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S). Participants in the 4S were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with simvastatin, 20 mg daily, with blinded dosage titration up to 40 mg daily, according to cholesterol response during the first 6-18 weeks, or placebo. Endpoints were 1) total mortality, 2) major CHD events (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction), 3) other acute atherosclerotic events, 4) myocardial revascularization procedures. RESULTS - Over the 5.4-year median follow-up period, simvastatin treatment produced mean changes in serum lipids in diabetic patients similar to those observed in nondiabetic patients. The relative risks (RRs) of main endpoints in simvastatin-treated diabetic patients were as follows: total mortality 0.57 (95% CI, 0.30-1.08; P = 0.087), major CHD events 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27- 0.74; P = 0.002), and any atherosclerotic event 0.63 (95% CI, 0.43-0.92; P = 0.018). The corresponding RRs in nondiabetic patients were the following: 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58-0.87; P = 0.001), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.60-0.77; P < 0.0001), and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.68-0.82; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS - The results strongly suggest that cholesterol lowering with simvastatin improves the prognosis of diabetic patients with CHD. The absolute clinical benefit achieved by cholesterol lowering may be greater in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients with CHD because diabetic patients have a higher absolute risk of recurrent CHD events and other atherosclerotic events.",,"simvastatin; adult; aged; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronary risk; diabetes mellitus; double blind procedure; drug effect; female; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; randomized controlled trial; scandinavia; Anticholesteremic Agents; Arteriosclerosis; Blood Pressure; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Disease; Diabetic Angiopathies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Lovastatin; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Revascularization; Placebos; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Scandinavia; Simvastatin; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Triglycerides",,"Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Lovastatin, 75330-75-5; Placebos; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Triglycerides",,,,"Kannel, W.B., McGee, D.L., Diabetes and cardiovascular disease: The Framingham Study (1979) JAMA, 241, pp. 2035-2038; Fuller, J.H., Shipley, M.J., Rose, G., Jarrett, R.J., Keen, H., Coronary-heart-disease and impaired glucose tolerance: The Whitehall Study (1980) Lancet, 1, pp. 1373-1376; Rosengren, A., Welin, L., Tsipogianni, A., Wilhelmsen, L., Impact of cardiovascular risk factors on coronary heart disease and mortality among middle aged diabetic men: A general population study (1989) Br Med J, 299, pp. 1127-1131; Laakso, M., Rönnemaa, T., Lehto, S., Puukka, P., Kallio, V., Pyörälä, K., Does NIDDM increase the risk for coronary heart disease similarly in both low- and high-risk populations?

Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark","Background: Molecular biology has improved the diagnostic abilities of physicians and enabled them to identify apparently healthy persons with a high risk of genetic disease. Objective: To examine the attitudes toward detection of disease and the present well-being in persons at risk of disease with a modifiable outcome, in this case heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and their hypercholesterolemic relatives. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was developed that collected information on the impact on well-being at present and at the time of diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia and on attitudes toward screening family members for heterozygous FH. It was mailed to 62 index patients with heterozygous FH, which was defined by using clinical criteria, and 108 hypercholesterolemic relatives. The response rate was 88%. Results were related to demographic data, experience of psychological or physiologic reactions in relation to awareness of hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular symptoms, lipid- lowering drug treatment, and information on the DNA-based diagnosis. Results: Of the respondents, anxiety was expressed by 44%, fear of coronary heart disease by 37%, and diminished well-being by 13%. These findings were most pronounced in persons who had experienced physiologic or psychological reactions at the time of diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia or who already had heart disease. Six percent regretted that they were aware of their disease diagnosis, and 84% were in favor of screening for affected individuals in families with a history of heterozygous FH. Conclusions: The results indicated that a substantial proportion of persons with heterozygous FH had some degree of anxiety. A small minority regretted that they were informed of the diagnosis of heterozygous FH, however, and a majority were in favor of family screening for heterozygous FH.",,"cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety; article; familial hypercholesterolemia; family history; fear; female; heterozygosity; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; patient attitude; priority journal; questionnaire; relative; screening; wellbeing; Clinical Approach/Source; Denmark; Empirical Approach; Family Members; Genetic Disorders; Genetics and Reproduction; Late-onset Disorders; Survey; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Attitude to Health; Fear; Female; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Middle Aged; Patients; Questionnaires",,,,,,"Korenberg, J.R., Rimoin, D.L., Medical genetics (1995) JAMA, 273, pp. 1692-1693; Gustavson, K.M., The prevention and management of autosomal recessive conditions: Main example: alpha 1-antitrypsIn deficiency (1989) Clin Genet, 36, pp. 327-332; Mulvihill, J.J., Prospects for cancer control and prevention through genetics (1989) Clin Genet, 36, pp. 313-319; Quaid, K.A., Psychological and ethical considerations in screening for disease (1993) Am J Cardiol, 72, pp. 64D-67D; Lerman, C., Rimer, B.K., Engstrom, P.F., Cancer risk notification: Psychosocial and ethical implications (1991) J Clin Oncol, 9, pp. 1275-1282; Clarke, A., Population screening for genetic susceptibility to disease (1995) BMJ, 311, pp. 35-38; Muller Hill, B., The shadow of genetic injustice (1993) Nature, 362, pp. 491-492; Kessler, S., Field, T., Worth, L., Mosbarger, H., Attitudes of persons at risk for Huntington disease toward predictive testing (1987) Am J Med Genet, 26, pp. 259-270; Meissen, G.J., Berchek, R.L., Intentions to use predictive testing by those at risk for Huntington's disease: Implications for prevention (1988) Am J Community Psy-Chol, 16, pp. 261-277; Mastromauro, C., Myers, R.H., Berkman, B., Attitudes toward presymptomatic testing in Huntington disease (1987) Am J Med Genet, 26, pp. 271-282; Lerman, C., Seay, J., Balshem, A., Audrain, J., Interest in genetic testing among first-degree relatives of breast cancer patients (1995) Am J Med Genet, 57, pp. 385-392; Lerman, C., Daly, M., Masny, A., Balshem, A., Attitudes about genetic testing for breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility (1994) J Clin Oncol, 12, pp. 843-850; Croyle, R.T., Lerman, C., Interest in genetic testing for colon cancer susceptibility: Cognitive and emotional correlates (1993) Prev Med, 22, pp. 284-292; Meissen, G.J., Mastromauro, C.A., Kiely, D.K., McNamara, D.S., Myers, R.H., Understanding the decision to take the predictive test for Huntington disease (1991) Am J Med Genet, 39, pp. 404-410; Brandt, J., Quaid, K.A., Folstein, S.E., Presymptomatic diagnosis of delayed-onset disease with linked DNA markers: The experience in Huntington's disease (1989) JAMA, 261, pp. 3108-3114; Wiggins, S., Whyte, P., Huggins, M., The psychological consequences of predictive testing for Huntington's disease: Canadian Collaborative Study of Predictive Testing (1992) N Engl J Med, 327, pp. 1401-1405; Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed., pp. 1981-2030. , Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D, eds.

Methods and Results: The distribution of apo(a) alleles was similar to that described in a Tyrolean population, and the size of the apo(a) alleles was inversely correlated to Lp(a) concentrations. When comparing results of apo(a) Kpnl genotyping and apo(a) protein phenotyping by SDS-PAGE the major differences were that subjects with single-banded protein phenotypes, in addition to the allele coding for the protein isoform detected by Western blotting, had an allele coding for S4, too. In agreement with these findings the majority of the O (null) isoforim had two apo(a) alleles that coded for S4 protein isoforms. Even though most of the apo(a) alleles associated with no detectable apo(a) protein were relatively large, they were distributed over the entire apo(a) allele size range. Conclusions: When comparing the distribution of apo(a) protein phenotypes and apo(a) Kpnl alleles in two groups according to protein size and allele size, respectively, we found no difference between the distributions and the median Lp(a) concentrations in the groups, suggesting that the use of apo(a) Kpnl genotyping would not have changed the results of previous studies comparing apo(a) allele distributions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. © 1997, Medikal Press.","Apolipoprotein; Lipoprotein; Lipoprotein(a)",,,,,,,"Utermann, G., The mysteries of Lp(a) lipoprotein (1990) Science, 246, pp. 904-910; Brown, M.S., Goldstein, J.L., Teaching old dogmas new tricks (1987) Nature, 330, pp. 113-114; Rhoads, G.G., Dahlen, G., Berg, K., Morton, N.E., Dannenberg, A.L., Lp (a) lipoprotein as a risk factor for myocardial infarction (1986) JAMA, 256, pp. 2540-2544; Dahlen, G.H., Guyton, J.R., Attar, M., Farmer, J.A., Kautz, J.A., Gotto, A.M., Association of levels of lipoprotein Lp(a) plasma lipids and other lipoproteins with coronary artery disease documented by angiography (1986) Circulation, 74, pp. 758-765; Kostner, G.M., Avogaro, P., Cazzolato, G., Marth, E., Bittolo-Bon, G., Qunici, G.B., Lipoprotein Lp(a) and the risk for myocardial infarction (1981) Atherosclerosis, 38, pp. 51-61; Armstrong, V.W., Cremer, P., Eberle, E., Manke, A., Schulze, F., Wieland Kreuzer, H., Seidel, D., The association between serum Lp(a) concentrations and angiographically assessed coronary atherosclerosis (1986) Atherosclerosis, 62, pp. 249-257; Rosengren, A., Wilhelmsen, L., Eriksson, E., Risberg, B., Wedel, H., Lipoprotein(a) and coronary heart disease: A prospective case-control study in a general population sample of middle-aged men (1990) Br Med J, 301, pp. 1248-1251; Lemming, L., Klausen, I.C., Hansen, P.S., Gerdes, L.U., Faergeman, O., Apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes in Danes with and without coronary heart disease (1995) Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis, 5, pp. 231-236; Schaefer, E.J., Lamon-Fava, S., Jenner, J.L., McNamara, J.R., Ordovas, J.M., Davis, E., Abolafia, J.M., Levi, R.I., Lipoprotein(a) levels and risk of coronary heart disease in men.

Med. and Cardiology A, Aarhus Amttsygehus, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Polymorphisms in the genes for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor ligands, apolipoprotein E (apoE), and apolipoprotein B (apoB) are associated with variation in plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. Lp(a) lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is LDL in which apoB is attached to a glycoprotein called apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. Apo(a) has several genetically determined isoforms differing in molecular weight, which are inversely correlated with Lp(a) concentrations in blood. The interaction of apo(a) with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins differs with the size of apo(a), and therefore the effects of apoE gene polymorphism on Lp(a) levels could also depend on apo(a) size. We have investigated the possible effect of genetic variation in the apoE and apoB genes on plasma Lp(a) concentrations in 466 white men with different apo(a) phenotypes. Overall there was no significant association between the common apoE polymorphism and Lp(a), but in the subgroup with apo(a)-S4, concentrations of Lp(a) differed significantly among the apoE genotypes (P = 0.05). Lp(a) was highest in the apoE genotypes ε2ε3 and ε3ε3 and lowest in genotype ε3ε4, and the apoE polymorphism was estimated to account for about 2.4% of the variation in Lp(a). In contrast, in the subgroup with apo(a)-S2 Lp(a) was significantly lower (P = 0.04) in apoE genotype ε2(ε)3 than in genotype ε3ε3 Lp(a) concentrations did not differ among the XbaI (P = 0.65) or SP 24/27 (P = 0.26) polymorphisms of the apoB gene. The expected effects of both apoE and apoB polymorphism on LDL levels were significant in the whole population sample and in subjects with large-sized apo(a) isoforms (P &lt; 0.01), whereas no effect was seen in those with low molecular weight apo(a) isoforms. We conclude that the influence of apoE genotypes on Lp(a) concentrations depends on the size of the apo(a) molecule in Lp(a), possibly because both apo(a)-S4 and apoE4 have high affinity for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and may be taken up and degraded rapidly by remnant receptors.","Apolipoprotein B; Apolipoprotein E; Cholesterol; Lipoprotein(a); Low-density lipoprotein receptor","apolipoprotein b; apolipoprotein e; high density lipoprotein; lipoprotein a; low density lipoprotein; article; cardiovascular disease; cholesterol metabolism; controlled study; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genotype; human; lipoprotein metabolism; major clinical study; male; population research; risk factor; Apolipoproteins A; Apolipoproteins E; Body Weight; Cholesterol; Coronary Disease; European Continental Ancestry Group; Humans; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, LDL; Male; Molecular Weight; Phenotype; Plasminogen Activators; Polymorphism, Genetic; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Triglycerides",,"Apolipoproteins A; Apolipoproteins E; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, LDL; Plasminogen Activators, EC 3.4.21.-; Triglycerides",,,,"Albers, J.J., Adolphson, J.L., Hazzard, W.R., Radioimmunoassay of human plasma Lp(a) lipoprotein (1977) J Lipid Res, 18, pp. 331-338; Blanco-Vaca, F., Gaubatz, J.W., Bren, N., Kottke, B., Morisett, J.D., Guevara Jr., J., Identification quantification of apolipoproteins in addition to to apo(a) and apoB100 in human lipoprotein(a) (1994) Chem Phys Lipids, 67-68, pp. 35-42; Beisiegel, U., Krapp, A., Weber, W., Olivecrona, G., The role of alpha2 M receptor/LRP in chylomicron remnant metabolism (1994) Ann NY Acad Sci, 737, pp. 53-69. , Borth W, Feinmann RD, Gonias SL, Quigley JP, Strickland DK (eds.)

Methods: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study was designed to evaluate the effects of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease. The 4444 patients aged 35 to 70 years (mean, 58.9 years) with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol levels of 5.5 to 8.0 mmol/k (213-310 mg/dL) receiving a lipid-lowering diet were randomly assigned to take double-blind treatment with simvastatin, 20 to 40 mg once daily, or placebo. In addition to previously reported end-point events, detailed clinical and laboratory safety data were collected during a median follow-up period of 5.4 years (range in survivors, 4.9-6.2 years). Results: The only clearly drug-related serious adverse event during the 5.4-year median follow-up period was a single reversible case of myopathy. The frequencies of persistent elevations of hepatic aminotransferase revels above 3 times the upper limit of normal and of nonviral hepatitis in the simvastatin and placebo treatment groups were not significantly different. Examination of the lens showed no between- group differences, and no previously unrecognized adverse effects of the drug were observed. There were no significant between-group differences in adverse events in any body system. In particular, the frequency of adverse events related to the central nervous system was similar in both groups. Conclusions: The safety profile of simvastatin, 20 to 40 mg daily, over 5 years was excellent.",,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; cholesterol; creatine kinase; hypocholesterolemic agent; placebo; simvastatin; angina pectoris; article; cataract; cholesterol blood level; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet therapy; double blind procedure; drug safety; drug tolerability; heart infarction; human; hypercholesterolemia; ischemic heart disease; long term care; major clinical study; myopathy; neurotoxicity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; scandinavia; survival rate; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol; Coronary Disease; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Lovastatin; Middle Aged; Simvastatin",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; cholesterol, 57-88-5; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Lovastatin, 75330-75-5; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9",,,,"Plosker, G.L., McTavish, D., Simvastatin: A reappraisal of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy (1995) Drugs, 50, pp. 334-363; Effect of Simvastatin on coronary atheroma: The Multi-centre Anti-Atheroma Study (MAAS) (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 633-638; Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1383-1389; Kjekshus, J., Pedersen, T.R., Reducing the risk of coronary events: Evidence from 4S (1995) Am J Cardiol, 76, pp. 64C-68C; Baseline serum cholesterol and treatment effect in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1995) Lancet, 345, pp. 1274-1275; Oliver, M., Poole-Wilson, P., Shepherd, J., Tikkanen, M., Lower patients' cholesterol now (1995) BMJ, 310, pp. 1280-1281; Wood, D.A., Cholesterol lowering does have a role in secondary prevention (1995) Br Heart J, 73, pp. 4-5; Kennedy, J.W., President's page: Expanding the role of the American College of Cardiology (1995) J Am Coll Cardiol, 26, pp. 289-290; Smith, S.C., Blair, S.N., Criqui, M.H., AHA consensus panel statement: Preventing heart attack and death in patients with coronary disease (1995) Circulation, 92, pp. 2-4; Oliver, M.F., Doubts about preventing coronary heart disease: Multiple interventions in middle-aged men may do more harm than good (1992) BMJ, 304, pp. 393-394; Davey Smith, G., Pekkanen, J., Should there be a moratorium on the use of cholesterol lowering drugs?

Transcript levels are measured by reverse transcription (RT), PCR, and electrophoresis on an automatic DNA sequencer using fluorescence-labeled primers and direct quantitation of the allele-specific RT-PCR products. The discrimination between the allelic products is based on the use of DNA polymorphisms located in the coding regions of the gene as markers for the individual alleles. Using this method on LDLR mRNA from heterozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) due to a defective LDLR protein, it is possible to relate the expression of the mutant allele directly to the expressed amounts of the normal allele, thus overcoming the problems of using artificial internal standards in the PCR. To validate the method we have measured (1) the range of normal LDLR allele transcript levels, and (2) the transcript levels in patients heterozygous for different types of mutant LDLR alleles associated with FH. The method is general in principle and can be applied in the allele-specific analysis of transcripts from all genes harbouring DNA polymorphisms in their coding regions.","Fluorescent DNA technology; Haplotyping; LDL receptor; Missense mutation; mRNA quantitation; Premature stop codon; Promoter mutation","complementary dna; dna; low density lipoprotein receptor; messenger rna; allele; article; autosomal dominant disorder; controlled study; dna polymorphism; dna sequence; familial hypercholesterolemia; genotype; haplotype; human; human cell; missense mutation; priority journal; promoter region; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; stop codon; Alleles; Female; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Pedigree; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptors, LDL; RNA, Messenger",,"Receptors, LDL; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Beisiegel, U., Schneider, W.J., Goldstein, J.L., Anderson, R.G., Brown, M.S., Monoclonal antibodies to the low- Density lipoprotein receptor as probes for study of receptor-mediated endocytosis and the genetics of familial hypercholesterolemia (1981) J Biol Chem, 256, pp. 11923-11931; Cooper, D.N., Human gene mutations affecting RNA processing and translation (1993) Ann Med, 25, pp. 11-17; Decker, C.J., Parker, R., Mechanisms of mRNA degradation in eukaryotes (1994) Trends Biochem Sci, 19, pp. 336-340; Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H.H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease, pp. 1981-2030. , Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D (ed): New York: McGraw-Hill; Heath, F., Jensen, T.G., Hansen, P.S., Jensen, L.G., Moestrup, S.K., Pedersen, S., Kølvraa, S., Færgeman, O., A flow cytometric competition technique for measuring interaction of LDL with cellular LDL-receptors applied to patients with mutant (Arg3500-Gln) apolipoprotein B (1995) German J Gastroenterol, , in press; Neitzel, H., A routine method for the establishment of permanent growing lymphoblastoid cell lines (1986) Hum Genet, 73, pp. 320-326; Soutar, A.K., A polymorphism in exon 2 of the human LDL-receptor gene (LDLR) (1991) Nucleic Acids Res, 19, p. 4314; Will, K., Reiss, J., Dean, M., Schlosser, M., Slomski, R., Schmidtke, J., Stuhrmann, M., CFTR transcripts are undetectable in lymphocytes and respiratory epithelial cells of a CF patient homozygous for the nonsense mutation R553X (1993) J Med Genet, 30, pp. 833-837; Zhang, Z.X., Wakamatsu, N., Mules, E.H., Thomas, G.H., Gravel, R.A., Impact of premature stop codons on mRNA levels in infantile Sandhoff disease (1994) Hum Mol Genet, 3, pp. 139-145; Zuliani, G., Hobbs, H.H., Dinucleotide repeat polymorphism at the 3′ end of the LDL receptor gene (1990) Nucleic Acids Res, 18, p. 4300","Jensen, L.G.; NCI-Navy Medical Oncology Branch, National Naval Medical Center, 8901 Wisconsin Ave., Bethesda, MD 20889-5101, United States",,,,,,,,10597794,,HUMUE,8844210,"English","HUM.

In 20 apparently unrelated Danish patients with a clinical diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), we identified 13 different mutations in the LDL receptor gene: two silent (C331C, N494 N); five missense (W66G, EII9K, T383P, W556S, T705I); one nonsense (W23X); three splice-site (313+IG→A, 1061- 8T→C, 1846-1G→A); and two frameshift (335de110, 1650delG) mutations. Four of these mutations, N494 N, T383P, 1061-8T→C, and W556S, have not been reported earlier. The pathogenicity of the T383P, 1061-8T→C, and W556S mutations remains to be established by in vitro mutagenesis and transfection studies. One patient had three mutations (335del10, 1061-8T→C, and T705I) on the same allele. Further, nine well-known polymorphisms were detectable with this methodological setup. Direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products used for the SSCP analysis did not reveal any sequence variations not detected by the PCR-SSCP method. In two patients we did not detect any mutation by either method. We conclude that the PCR-SSCP analysis, performed as described here, is as sensitive and efficient as DNA sequencing in the ability to identify the sequence variations in the LDL receptor gene of the patients with heterozygous FH of this study.","familial hypercholesterolemia; mutation","dna; low density lipoprotein receptor; article; chemosensitivity; diagnostic accuracy; dna sequence; familial hypercholesterolemia; gene amplification; gene mutation; human; human cell; receptor gene; sequence analysis; single strand conformation polymorphism; Base Sequence; DNA; DNA Mutational Analysis; Exons; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Receptors, LDL; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; Receptors, LDL",,,,,"Jensen, H.K.; Internal Medicine/Cardiology Dept., Aarhus Amtssygehus Univ.

Since apoE is involved in many important biological processes, selection forces could have favoured ε3. We hypothesized that apoE genotypes may affect reproductive efficiency, and we therefore compared the distributions of 40-year-old married men with known genotypes by the numbers of their biological children. The distributions were statistically significantly different (P = 0.0026). On average, men with the ε3ε3 genotype (n = 212) had 1.93 children, men with the ε3ε4 or ε4ε4 genotype (n = 105) had 1.50, and men with the ε3ε2 or ε2ε2 genotypes (n = 53) had 1.66 children. Of the men in the three groups, 6%, 26% and 19%, respectively, reported being childless. These findings are unlikely to be due to gross error in the reported prevalence of childlessness, differences in socioeconomic status or other likely sources of bias.

Physicians and third-party payers need to assess the economic impact of treatments that reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Methods and Results: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which simvastatin reduced the risk of death by 30% (P=.0003) over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris as a result of a 42% reduction in the risk of coronary deaths (P=.00001). In the present report, data prospectively collected from hospital admissions were analyzed to evaluate the impact of simvastatin on healthcare resource use and perform a cost-minimization analysis. In the placebo group (n=2223), there were 1905 hospitalizations (average duration, 7.9 days) for acute cardiovascular events or coronary revascularization procedures among 937 patients, whereas in the simvastatin group (n=2221), there were 1403 such hospitalizations (average duration, 7.1 days) among 720 patients (all differences, P<.0001). The corresponding number of hospital days was 15 089 and 9951 in the two groups, respectively (34% reduction, P<.0001). In the United States, the resulting reduction in hospitalization costs over the 5.4 years of the trial would be $3872 per patient, reducing the effective cost of simvastatin by 88% to $0.28 per day. Conclusions: In addition to reducing mortality and morbidity in coronary heart disease patients, simvastatin markedly reduces use of hospital services, thus offsetting most of its cost.","Cholesterol; Coronary disease; Drugs; Prevention","simvastatin; adult; aged; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronary risk; cost benefit analysis; double blind procedure; drug research; female; heart death; heart infarction; hospitalization; human; hypercholesterolemia; major clinical study; male; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk management; survival; Adult; Aged; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol; Coronary Disease; Double-Blind Method; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Lovastatin; Male; Middle Aged; Simvastatin",,"Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Lovastatin, 75330-75-5; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9",,,,"(1994) Heart and Stroke Facts: 1994 Statistical Supplement, , Dallas, Tex: American Heart Association; Randomized trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1383-1389; Baseline serum cholesterol and treatment effect in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1995) Lancet, 345, pp. 1274-1275; Summary of the second report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel II) (1993) JAMA, 269, pp. 3015-3023; Pyörälä, K., De Backer, G., Graham, I., Poole-Wilson, P., Wood, D., Prevention of coronary heart disease in clinical practice: Recommendations of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology, European Atherosclerosis Society and European Society of Hypertension (1994) Eur Heart J., 15, pp. 1300-1331; Oster, G., Epstein, A.M., Cost-effectiveness of antihyperlipemic therapy in the prevention of coronary heart disease (1987) JAMA, 258, pp. 2381-2387; Kinosian, B.P., Eisenberg, J.M., Cutting into cholesterol: Cost-effective alternatives for treating hypercholesterolemia (1988) JAMA, 259, pp. 2249-2254; Goldman, L., Weinstein, M.C., Goldman, P.A., Williams, L.W., Cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (1991) JAMA, 265, pp. 1145-1151; Sønbø Kristiansen, I., Eggen, A.L., Thelle, D.S., Cost-effectiveness of incremental programmes for lowering serum cholesterol concentration: Is individual intervention worth while?

However, only a few splice site mutations have been identified in this gene. We here report a defect presumably affecting the splicing of precursor mRNA, resulting from a novel mutation, a G to A transition at the terminal nucleotide of intron 12, of the LDLR gene detected in three unrelated families with heterozygous FH. This mutation markedly reduced the steady-state transcript level of the mutant LDLR allele as compared to the corresponding normal LDLR allele in heterozygous FH patients as measured by a fluorescence based, allele-specific quantitation technique. In the FH families, the acceptor splice site mutation cosegregates with hypercholesterolemia, and it is associated with onset of ischemic heart disease in the fifth and sixth decade of life.","Familial hypercholesterolemia; Low density lipoprotein receptor; mRNA; Single-strand conformation polymorphism; Splice site mutation","adenine; guanine; low density lipoprotein receptor; messenger rna; allele; article; autosomal dominant disorder; controlled study; familial hypercholesterolemia; gene mutation; human; human cell; intron; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; nucleic acid base substitution; priority journal; rna splicing; Adult; Aged; Alleles; Base Sequence; Conserved Sequence; Denmark; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Haplotypes; Heterozygote; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Point Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Receptors, LDL; RNA Splicing; Transcription, Genetic",,"Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific, EC 3.1.21.4; endodeoxyribonuclease DdeI, EC 3.1.21.-; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Friedewald, W.T., Levy, F.I., Fredrickson, D.S., Estimation of the concentration of the low density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma without use of the preparative ultracentrifuge (1972) Clin Chem, 18, pp. 499-509; Goldstein, J.L., Hobbs, H., Brown, M.S., Familial hypercholesterolemia (1995) The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease, 7th Edn., pp. 1981-2030. , Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D, eds.

We tested the hypothesis that captopril could reductively cleave the lipoprotein(a) molecule and in addition act as a scavenger of oxygen free radicals. In a double-blind trial, 20 patients were randomized to receive either captopril 50 mg daily or corresponding placebo. Patients were followed for a period of 30 days. Blood samples were drawn prior to randomization and after 30 days of treatment. Plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) and malondialdehyde were evaluated. Captopril treatment produced a significant reduction in plasma content of lipoprotein(a) (p < 0.05) and at day 30 the plasma content of lipoprotein(a) was also significantly lower than that in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, on day 30 plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde, an indicator of oxidative damage, were significantly lower in the captopril group when compared to baseline values and corresponding placebo group values (p < 0.05). The observed effect of captopril treatment on lipoprotein(a) and malondialdehyde might be ascribed to the sulfhydryl group in the captopril molecule.","Captopril; Lipoprotein(a); Myocardial infarction; Oxygen free radicals","captopril; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; lipoprotein a; malonaldehyde; oxygen radical; scavenger; acute heart infarction; adult; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug effect; female; human; lipoprotein blood level; male; priority journal; protein degradation; randomized controlled trial; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Captopril; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Free Radicals; Humans; Lipoprotein(a); Male; Malondialdehyde; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Oxygen; Survivors; Treatment Outcome",,"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Captopril, 62571-86-2; Free Radicals; Lipoprotein(a); Malondialdehyde, 542-78-9; Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,,"Sogaard, P.; Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage Hansensgade 2-4, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,,,,,,,00086312,,CAGYA,8631039,"English","CARDIOLOGY",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029655249

Their genes are therefore likely to be similar to those in the original Eskimo gene pool. We have compared serum concentrations of Lp(a) and apo(a) phenotypes in 78 East Greenland Eskimos (EGE) with those in Eskimos from Western Greenland (WGE) (n=100) and Caucasian Danes (n=466). Lp(a) levels were higher in EGE (median: 11.9 mg/dl [95% CI: 9.1-16.4]) than in Danes (p<0.01), (median: 6.3 mg/dl [95% CI: 5.5-7.3]) and WGE (p<0.01), (median: 7.8 mg/dl [95% CI: 5.7-10.2]). Lp(a) concentrations above 30 mg/dl were (p<0.05) more common in EGE (19%) than in WGE (9%) and similar (p=0.89) to those in Danes (20%). Apo(a) molecules as small as S2 or smaller (S1, B and F) were present in 26% of Danes and in 3% of WGE but were absent in EGE (p<0.01). In contrast, a large apo(a) variant (VS4) was present in 54% of EGE and 62% of WGE, whereas it was very rare in Danes (2%). Lp(a) concentrations were inversely associated with apo(a) size in EGE (p<0.05), WGE (p<0.01) and Danes (p<0.01), but EGE with S3 or S4 had significantly higher Lp(a) levels than Danes (p<0.05) with the same phenotypes. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Apolipoprotein(a);

Genet., Innsbruck, Austria","The enormous interindividual variation in the plasma concentrations of the atherogenic lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is almost entirely controlled by the apo(a) locus on chromosome 6q26-q27. A variable number of transcribed kringle4 repeats (K4-VNTR) in the gene explains a large fraction of this variation, whereas the rest is presently unexplained. We here have analyzed the effect of the K4-VNTR and of a pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism (TTTTA)n (n = 6-11) in the 5′ control region of the apo(a) gene on plasma Lp(a) levels in unrelated healthy Tyroleans (n = 130), Danes (n = 154), and Black South Africans (n = 112). The K4-VNTR had a significant effect on plasma Lp(a) levels in Caucasians and explained 41 and 45% of the variation in Lp(a) plasma concentration in Tyroleans and Danes, respectively. Both, the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) allele frequencies and their effects on Lp(a) concentrations were heterogeneous among populations. A significant negative correlation between the number of pentanucleotide repeats and the plasma Lp(a) concentration was observed in Tyroleans and Danes. The effect of the 5' PNRP on plasma Lp(a) concentrations was independent from the K4-VNTR and explained from 10 to 14% of the variation in Lp(a) concentrations in Caucasians. No significant effect of the PNRP was present in Black Africans. This suggests allelic association between PNR alleles and sequences affecting Lp(a) levels in Caucasians. Thus, in Caucasians but not in Blacks, concentrations of the atherogenic Lp(a) particle are strongly associated with two repeat polymorphisms in the apo(a) gene.","Atherosclerosis; Kringle4; Lipoprotein(a); Population genetics; Quantitative trait","adult; article; atherosclerosis; caucasian; chromosome 6q; dna polymorphism; female; gene sequence; human; major clinical study; male; population genetics; priority journal; quantitative trait; Adult; Aged; Alleles; Apolipoproteins; Base Sequence; Caucasoid Race; Female; Human; Lipoprotein(a); Male; Meiosis; Middle Age; Molecular Sequence Data; Negroid Race; Polymorphism (Genetics); Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"apolipoprotein Lp(a+); Apolipoproteins; Lipoprotein(a)",,,,,"Utermann, G.; Inst. of Med.

The underlying genetic defects are mutations in the apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) gene. Two mutations (Arg3500 → Gln and Arg3531 → Cys) are known to date. We designed a denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique to detect sequence variations in codons 3456-3553 of the apo B-100 gene. In 46 heterozygous FDB patients with the predominant codon 3500 mutation, a uniform four-band DGGE pattern was seen, whereas 57 non-FDB patients showed the uniform single-band pattern expected in normal homozygotes. The recently described codon 3531 mutation and a previously unpublished Arg → Pro mutation in codon 3480 showed unique DGGE patterns, allowing unambiguous differentiation of the three mutations. The DGGE method thus both detects known FDB mutations and screens for other mutations in codons 3456-3553 of the low-density lipoprotein receptor binding region of apo B-100; it can be used as a first- line screening method for FDB.","familial defective apolipoprotein B; heritable disorders; hypercholesterolemia; polymerase chain reaction","apolipoprotein b; arginine; cysteine; dna fragment; glutamine; low density lipoprotein; nucleotide; proline; agar gel electrophoresis; article; clinical article; codon; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; dna sequence; gene; gene mutation; human; hypercholesterolemia; polymerase chain reaction; receptor binding; Apolipoproteins B; Base Sequence; Codon; Denmark; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Heterozygote; Human; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Denaturation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"arginine, 1119-34-2, 15595-35-4, 7004-12-8, 74-79-3; cysteine, 4371-52-2, 52-89-1, 52-90-4; glutamine, 56-85-9, 6899-04-3; proline, 147-85-3, 7005-20-1; apolipoprotein B-100; Apolipoproteins B; Codon",,,,,"Nissen, H.; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Odense University Hospital, 5000 Odense C, Denmark",,,,,,,,00099147,,CLCHA,7882518,"English","CLIN.

Apo(a) has several genetically determined phenotypes differing in molecular weight, to which Lp(a) concentrations in plasma are inversely correlated. High plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with atherosclerotic diseases. It is therefore of interest to study whether factors other than the apo(a) gene locus are involved in the regulation of Lp(a) concentrations. We measured plasma concentrations of Lp(a) and other lipoproteins and determined apo(a) phenotypes in 31 patients with hyperthyroidism, before and after the patients had become euthyroid by treatment. The mean concentration of LDL cholesterol rose from 2.67 to 3.88 mmol/l (P<0.01), apoB rose from 0.79 to 1.03 g/l (P<0.01), and the median Lp(a) concentration increased from 9.74 to 18.97 mg/dl (P<0.01) on treatment. Lp(a) concentrations were inversely associated to the size of the apo(a) molecule both before (P< 0.01) and after treatment (P<0.01). The increase in Lp(a) was significant patients with high molecular weight apo(a) phenotypes (n = 9; P<0.01) and in patients with low molecular weight apo(a) phenotypes (n=16; P< 0.01), but not in those with apo(a) ""null types"" (n = 6; P = 0.5). The low levels LDL cholesterol and apoB in untreated hyperthyroidism may result from increased LDL receptor activity. The increase in Lp(a) levels were not correlated with the increase in LDL cholesterol or apoB. Most other clinical evidence indicates that the LDL receptor is not important in Lp(a) catabolism, and we suggest that the low Lp(a) levels seen in thyroid hormone excess are caused by an inhibition of Lp(a) synthesis. © 1995 Springer.","Apolipoproteins; Cholesterol; Hyperthyroidism; Lipoprotein receptor; Lipoprotein(a)","apolipoprotein; apolipoprotein B; apolipoprotein Lp(a+); cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; liothyronine; lipoprotein A; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; thyrotropin; thyroxine; triacylglycerol; apolipoprotein a; lipoprotein a; lipoprotein receptor; low density lipoprotein; thiamazole; adult; article; blood; female; genetics; human; hyperthyroidism; male; phenotype; clinical article; controlled study; hyperthyroidism; lipoprotein metabolism; Apolipoproteins; Apolipoproteins B; Cholesterol; Female; Human; Hyperthyroidism; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, LDL Cholesterol; Male; Middle Age; Phenotype; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Thyrotropin; Thyroxine; Triglycerides; Triiodothyronine",,"cholesterol, 57-88-5; liothyronine, 6138-47-2, 6893-02-3; thyrotropin, 9002-71-5; thyroxine, 7488-70-2; thiamazole, 60-56-0; apolipoprotein Lp(a+); Apolipoproteins B; Apolipoproteins; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, LDL Cholesterol; Thyrotropin, 9002-71-5; Thyroxine, 7488-70-2; Triglycerides; Triiodothyronine, 6893-02-3",,,,"Abra, J.J., Grundy, S.M., Cholesterol metabolism in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in man (1981) J Lipid Res, 22, pp. 323-338; Albers, J.J., Taggart, M.H., Applebaum-Bowden, D., Haffner, S., Chesnut, C.H., III, Hazzard, W.R., Reduction of Lecitincholesterol acyltransferase, apolipoprotein D and the Lp(a) lipoprotein with the anabolic steroid stanozolol (1984) Biochim Biophys Acta, 795, pp. 293-296; Artrong, V.W., Cremer, P., Eberle, E., Manke, A., Schulze, F., Wieland Kreuzer, H., Seidel, D., The association between serum Lp(a) concentrations and angiographically assessed coronary atherosclerosis (1986) Atherosclerosis, 62, pp. 249-257; Artrong, V.W., Schleff, J., Thiery, J., Muche, R., Schuff-Werner, P., Eisenhauer, T., Seidel, D., Effect of HELP-LDL-apheresis on serum concentrations of human lipoprotein(a): kinetic analyses of post treatment return to baseline levels (1989) Eur J Clin Invest, 19, pp. 235-240; Bimmermann, A., Boerschmann, C., Schwarzkopff, W., Von Baeyer, H., Schleicher, J., Effective therapeutic measures for reducing lipoprotein(a) in patients with dyslipidemia.

Cases were 682 students with a paternal history of myocardial infarction, and control subjects were 1312 student without such a history. The students were enrolled in 14 universities in five European regions (Finland, Great Britain, and northern, middle, and southern Europe). Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations were skewed towards lower concentrations in both cases (median, 7.3 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, 6.3 to 8.1 mg/dL) and control subjects (median, 6.6 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, 6.1 to 7.2 mg/dL) (P=.37). Significantly more northern European male cases than control subjects had Lp(a) levels exceeding 30 mg/dL (P=.040), but this did not pertain to females (P=.29), and overall, there was no difference between cases (16.5%) and control subjects (15.5%) in the frequency of Lp(a) concentrations above 30 mg/dL (P=.63). As expected, there was a significant (P<.01) inverse relationship between apo(a) molecular size and Lp(a) concentration. In Great Britain there was a significant difference in phenotype distribution between cases and control subjects (P=.035), due mainly to a high frequency of the apo(a) S2 isoform in cases. A similar but statistically insignificant tendency was seen in northern Europeans. In the three other regions, however, the distribution of apo(a) phenotypes among cases and controls was similar, and in the study population overall, the distribution of apo(a) phenotypes did not differ significantly (P=.74) between cases and control subjects.","apolipoprotein(a); lipoprotein(a); lipoproteins","apolipoprotein a; lipoprotein a; adolescent; adult; article; atherosclerosis; controlled study; coronary risk; environmental factor; europe; female; genetic risk; heart infarction; human; lipoprotein blood level; major clinical study; male; phenotype; priority journal; risk assessment; Adult; Apolipoproteins; Arteriosclerosis; Blotting, Western; Case-Control Studies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Europe; Gene Frequency; Geography; Human; Lipoprotein(a); Male; Myocardial Infarction; Phenotype",,"apolipoprotein Lp(a+); Apolipoproteins; Lipoprotein(a)",,,,,"Faergeman, O.; Department of Medicine/Cardiology A, Aarhus Amtssygehus University Hosp., Tage Hansensgade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,,,,,,,10795642,,ATVBF,7627688,"English","ARTERIOSCLER.

However, the populations studied were relatively small and heterogeneous in regard to age, sex, and ethnic background. Methods and Results: Associations of a HindIII (intron 8) and a Pvu II (intron 6) RFLP in the LPL gene with plasma concentrations of cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were studied in 457 randomly selected 40-year old Danish men. The HindIII and the Pvu II sites were in strong linkage disequilibrium. The frequencies of the H+ and P+ alleles (+ denotes presence of cutting site) were 0.717 and 0.464, respectively. In multivariate analysis, there was a clear gone dosage effect of the II+ allele on HDL. The lowest HDL cholesterol concentration was in the H+H+ group, the highest concentration was in the H-H- group, and the H+H- group had intermediate HDL concentrations (P=.03). There was a similar, but not statistically significant gent dosage effect on triglyceride concentrations, with the highest value seen in the H+H+ group. There were no other associations between LPL RFLPs and lipoprotein components. In males reporting family history of premature ischemic heart disease, the H+H+ genotype was overrepresented (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 5.53). Conclusions: The results suggest that genetic variation in or near the LPL gene plays a role in interindividual differences in HDL cholesterol concentration and in risk of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease in men.","cholesterol; coronary disease; genes; lipoproteins; triglycerides","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipid; lipoprotein lipase; triacylglycerol; adult; allele; article; atherosclerosis; cholesterol blood level; coronary artery disease; denmark; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; human; human cell; intron; ischemic heart disease; lipid blood level; male; normal human; priority journal; restriction fragment length polymorphism; triacylglycerol blood level; Adult; Alleles; Cholesterol; Gene Frequency; Human; Introns; Lipids; Lipoprotein Lipase; Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol; Male; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism (Genetics); Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Random Allocation; Sampling Studies; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Triglycerides; Variation (Genetics)",,"lipid, 66455-18-3; lipoprotein lipase, 83137-80-8, 9004-02-8; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Lipids; Lipoprotein Lipase, EC 3.1.1.34; Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol; Triglycerides",,,,,"Gerdes, C.; Dept. of Internal Med./Cardiology A, Aarhus Amtssygehus University Hosp., Tage Hansensgade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,,,,,,,00097322,,CIRCA,7671359,"English","CIRCULATION",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029156010

This mutation, designated as FH DK-4, deletes 10 nucleotides from exon 4 coding for the third cysteine-rich repeat of the ligand-binding domain. The resulting translational frameshift and stop codon corresponding to amino acid position 181 in the LDL receptor cDNA is predicted to result in a truncated LDL receptor protein. Several family members had hyperlipidemia and early onset of ischemic heart disease not due to the 10 bp deletion, and several family members had unexpectedly high serum lipoprotein(a) contributing to high concentrations of serum LDL cholesterol.

The concentration ranges of these variables were broad in each family, and there was no between-family difference in means for cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. There was no phenotype-specific difference in Lp(a) concentrations between FDB patients and non-FDB relatives. Apo E4 is normally associated with higher concentrations of LDL and apo E2 with lower concentrations. This relation was partly reversed in FDB patients: apo E4 was associated with lower apo B concen-trations and apo E2 with higher apo B concentrations. Tendon xanthomata were found in members of two of the five families. Six of 12 FOB patients &gt;50 years old had atherosclerotic disease. In contrast, all 18 non-FDB relatives &gt;50 years old were apparently healthy. A total of 8 FDB patients with atherosclerotic disease had 36% higher cholesterol concentrations, 28% higher apo B concentrations, 50% higher triglyceride concentrations, and 120% higher Lp(a) concentrations than FDB patients without clinical atherosclerosis. The haplotype background for the apo B-3500 mutation in these Danish families, as defined with seven markers, was comparable to that found in kindreds from the United States, Canada, Austria, Italy, and Germany.","Apolipoprotein E; Atherosclerosis; Epidemiology; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Genetics; Lipoprotein(a)","apolipoprotein a; apolipoprotein b; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; adolescent; adult; aged; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; denmark; female; genetic risk; heterozygosity; human; human cell; human tissue; hypercholesterolemia; hyperlipoproteinemia type 2; male; marker gene; priority journal; risk factor; school child; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Apolipoproteins B; Apolipoproteins E; Arteriosclerosis; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholesterol; Comparative Study; Denmark; Female; Genotype; Haplotypes; Heterozygote; Human; Lipoproteins, LDL Cholesterol; Male; Middle Age; Mutation; Osmolar Concentration; Polymorphism (Genetics); Reference Values; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"apolipoprotein B-100; Apolipoproteins B; Apolipoproteins E; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Lipoproteins, LDL Cholesterol",,,,,"Faergeman, O.; Dept. of Int.

In 15 Danish patients with heterozygous FH we have screened exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene for point mutations and small rearrangements employing genomic DNA amplification and bidirectional solid-phase sequencing. Two subjects were found to be heterozygous for a guanine to adenine base substitution at nucleotide position 418 of the LDL receptor cDNA. This point mutation results in an amino acid change from glutamic acid to lysine at amino acid residue 119 in the third repeat of the cysteine-rich ligand binding domain of the mature LDL receptor. Disruption of LDL receptor function by the Glu119-Lys mutation was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in COS-7 cells. By Western blotting the mutation was found to affect the processing of the LDL receptor protein. Using flow cytometric analysis of the transfected cells a decreased binding and internalization of LDL by the mutant receptor was documented. By means of a mutation-specific PCR-based assay the Glu119-Lys mutation was not detected in another 85 apparently unrelated Danish heterozygous FH patients. We identified six persons in the index families with the Glu119-Lys mutation cosegregating with the clinical syndrome of FH in these families. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotype [SfaNI+, StuI+, AvaII-, (dTA)7] of the mutation carrying allele was the same in the two apparently unrelated patients. This indicates that the mutation has been inherited from a common ancestor. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Dil-LDL; DNA sequence analysis; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Flow cytometry; Haplotype analysis;

Our findings in this large study are reassuring, since, if appreciable and systematic misclassification of genotypes do occur by using IEF, as has been reported from some laboratories, it may influence the validity of genetic epidemiological studies. © 1994.","DNA; Epidemiology; Genetic epidemiology; Genetics; Polymerase chain reaction; Restriction enzyme","apolipoprotein e; article; dna determination; epidemiology; genotype; human; immunoblotting; isoelectric focusing; male; phenotype; polymerase chain reaction; population genetics; priority journal; protein polymorphism; Adult; Amino Acids; Apolipoproteins E; Comparative Study; Denmark; Epidemiologic Methods; Genotype; Human; Isoelectric Focusing; Male; Phenotype; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism (Genetics); Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"Amino Acids; Apolipoproteins E",,,,"Mahley, Apolipoprotein E: cholesterol transport protein with expanding role in cell biology (1988) Science, 240, pp. 622-630; Smit, de Knijff, Rosseneau, Apolipoprotein E polymorphism in the Netherlands and its effect on plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels (1988) Hum Genet, 80, pp. 287-292; Utermann, Hees, Steinmetz, Polymorphism of apolipoprotein E and occurence of dysbeta-lipoproteinemia in man (1977) Nature (London), 341, pp. 162-163; Havekes, de Knijff, Beisiegel, Havinga, Smit, Klasen, A rapid micromethod for apolipoprotein E phenotyping directly in serum (1987) J Lipid Res, 28, pp. 455-463; Dallongeville, Lussier-Cacan, Davignon, Modulation of plasma triglyceride levels by apo E phenotype: a meta-analysis (1992) J Lipid Res, 33, pp. 447-454; Boerwinkle, Visvikis, Welsh, Steinmetz, Hanash, Sing, The use of measured genotype information in the analysis of quantitative phenotypes in Man.

The XbaI and the Ins/Del polymorphic alleles were associated with variation in T-C, but only in patients below the 75th percentile for age. The XbaI and Ins/Del polymorphic alleles were synergistically associated with variation in T-C: the X+ and the Del alleles were associated with higher cholesterol concentrations. Younger male patients had the highest frequency of haplotypes including both the X+ and the Del alleles, but the most striking difference was a significantly higher frequency of haplotypes including both the X- and the Ins alleles in female and in older male patients. The heterogeneity of association of polymorphic alleles in the apolipoprotein B gene to complex traits like hypercholesterolemia and ischemic heart disease in this study could explain why in most studies the X+ allele has been associated with higher cholesterol levels, whereas the X- allele has been associated with symptomatic atherosclerosis.

Lp(a) may be as atherogenic as LDL. In normal populations, Lp(a) concentrations in plasma are largely determined by the apo(a) gene locus on chromosome 6, but regulation of synthesis and catabolism of Lp(a) is poorly understood. In some studies, a PvuII restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in the LDL receptor gene seems to affect concentrations of LDL in plasma, and other studies have indicated that Lp(a) catabolism could be mediated by the LDL receptor. We therefore expected that the PvuII polymorphism in the LDL receptor gene might be associated with Lp(a) levels in 170 Caucasian men aged 40 years, selected to have a high representation of low molecular weight apo(a) phenotypes. However, plasma concentrations of cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and Lp(a) were all unrelated to the LDL receptor gene PvuII polymorphism both in the group as a whole and when it was subgrouped by apo(a) phenotype. Therefore our data do not support the concept that this particular LDL receptor gene polymorphism is associated with LDL receptor function, and our data therefore neither support nor rule out a role for the LDL receptor in Lp(a) catabolism. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",,"apolipoprotein a; apolipoprotein b100; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein a; low density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein receptor; triacylglycerol; adult; article; cholesterol blood level; gene frequency; human; human cell; lipoprotein blood level; male; normal human; priority journal; restriction fragment length polymorphism; triacylglycerol blood level; Adult; Base Sequence; Chi-Square Distribution; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific; DNA; Gene Frequency; Human; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, LDL; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Receptors, LDL; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"cholesterol, 57-88-5; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific, EC 3.1.21.4; DNA, 9007-49-2; endodeoxyribonuclease PvuII, EC 3.1.21.-; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, LDL; Receptors, LDL",,,,"Artrong, V.W., Harrach, B., Robenek, H., Helmhold, M., Walli, A.K., Seidel, D., Heterogeneity of lipoprotein Lp(a): cytochemical and biochemical studies of two Lp(a) species with the LDL receptor (1990) J Lipid Res, 31, pp. 429-441; Cambell, M.J., Gardner, M.J., Calculating confidence intervals for some non-parametric analyses (1989) Statistics with confidence — confidence intervals and statistical guidelines, pp. 71-79. , M.J., Gardner, D.G., Altman, British Medical Journal, London; Daga, A., Fabbi, M., Mattioni, T., Bertolini, S., Corte, G., PvuII polymorphism of low density lipoprotein receptor gene and familial hypercholesterolemia.

Also, other invariate symptoms of LCAT deficiency, a significant increase of unesterified cholesterol in plasma lipoproteins and the reduction of plasma HDL-cholesterol to levels below one-tenth of normal, were present in all probands. In the probands from two families, no mass was detectable, while in others reduced amounts of LCAT mass indicated the presence of a functionally inactive protein. Sequence analysis identified homozygous missense or nonsense mutations in four probands. Two probands from one family both were found to be compound heterozygotes for a missense mutation and for a single base insertion causing a reading frame-shift. Subsequent family analyses were carried out using mutagenic primers for carrier identification. LCAT activity and LCAT mass in 23 genotypic heterozygotes were approximately half normal and clearly distinct from those of 20 unaffected family members. In the homozygous patients no obvious relationship between residual LCAT activity and the clinical phenotype was seen. The observation that the molecular defects in LCAT deficiency are dispersed in different regions of the enzyme suggests the existence of several functionally important structural domains in this enzyme.","(Automated) DNA sequencing; Corneal opacities; Foam cells; Genetic disease; Mutagenic polymerase chain reaction primers","cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; phosphatidylcholine sterol acyltransferase; adult; allele; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; clinical feature; dna sequence; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; female; foam cell; gene mutation; genetic heterogeneity; heterozygote detection; human; lipoprotein blood level; male; pedigree analysis; phenotype; priority journal; Adolescent; Adult; Alleles; Base Sequence; Female; Human; Lecithin Acyltransferase Deficiency; Male; Middle Age; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phenotype; Phosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferase; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,"cholesterol, 57-88-5; phosphatidylcholine sterol acyltransferase, 9031-14-5; Phosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.43",,,,,"Funke, H.; Inst.

Four DNA polymorphisms in the apo AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster (G to A mutation at position -75 basepairs in the apo AI promoter, XmnI, PstI and SstI) were studied in relation to combined hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, lipoprotein levels, atherosclerosis and age in 221 Danish men. The frequency of the rare allele of the XmnI polymorphism, the X+ allele, was higher in individuals below 55 years of age with combined hyperlipidemia than in individuals with normal lipid levels (0.31 vs. 0.14; P = 0.05). The rare allele of the SstI polymorphism, the S+ allele, was more frequent in hyper-triglyceridemic individuals compared with normotriglyceridemic individuals (0.16 vs. 0.09; P &lt; 0.05) and on analysis of variance the combined S-S+ and S+S+ genotypes were also associated with the highest triglyceride levels. Furthermore, the frequency of the S+ allele decreased significantly as a function of age in nonatherosclerotic subjects (from 0.15 to 0.10 to 0.02 in 48-, 63- and 85-year-olds, respectively; 48- versus 85-year-olds, P = 0.03). These results suggest that genetic variation in the apo AICIIIAIV gene complex is associated with combined hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia and may have an impact on longevity and/or predisposition to atherosclerosis. © 1993.","Atherosclerosis; Cholesterol; Chromosome 11; Coronary heart disease; Familial combined hyperlipidemia; Genetic markers; Hyperlipoproteinemia; Restriction fragment length polymorphisms; Triglycerides","adult; article; atherosclerosis; female; genetics; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertriglyceridemia; major clinical study; male; priority journal; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoproteins A; Apolipoproteins C; Arteriosclerosis; Coronary Disease; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Genetic Markers; Human; Hyperlipidemia, Familial Combined; Hypertriglyceridemia; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Age; Multigene Family; Myocardial Infarction; Polymorphism (Genetics); Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"Apolipoprotein A-I; apolipoprotein A-IV; apolipoprotein C-III; Apolipoproteins A; Apolipoproteins C; Genetic Markers; Lipids; Lipoproteins",,,,"Goldstein, Schrott, Hazzard, Bierman, Motulsky, Hyperlipidemia in coronary heart disease.

IC and C subjects were matched pairwise for sex, age, and smoking habits. Plasma Lp(a) concentrations were significantly higher in IC subjects, with a median value of 20.12 mg/dl, compared with 11.11 mg/dl in C subjects (p<0.0009). The elevated Lp(a) concentration was to a great extent due to a significant difference in the frequency distribution of apo(a) isofornis between IC and C subjects (p<0.029). Low-molecular-weight apo(a) isoforms were more prevalent in IC than C subjects. Also, IC subjects with apo(a) S2 and S3 phenotypes had higher Lp(a) concentrations than control subjects with the same phenotypes: S2:60.70 mg/dl (IC) and 48.69 mg/dl (C),p<0.038; and S3:30.18 mg/dl (IC) and 12.01 mg/dl (C),p<0.042, so other still-unknown factors, genetic or nongenetic, may be important. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Lp(a) concentration contributed significantly (p<0.0002) to IC, independent of age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, apo B, and plasma total triglycerides. Apo(a) isoforms grouped according to molecular weight were also independent of the above risk factors associated (p=0.016) with the occurrence of IC because of their low-molecular-weight but were not independent of Lp(a) concentrations. Because IC and C subjects had similar smoking habits, the study also suggests that elevated Lp(a) levels due to a preponderance of low-molecular-weight apo(a) isoforms may be an explanation for the difference in risk that smokers have for developing IC.

This has been explained by a high intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with beneficial effects on blood lipids and hemostasis. In other populations, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is associated with IHD, plasma concentrations of Lp(a) being genetically determined to a major extent. We have compared Lp(a) concentrations and apo(a) phenotypes in 120 Greenlandic Eskimos with those in 466 Danish men. The median Lp(a) concentration in Eskimos (8.7mg/dl;[95% CI 6.5-10.7]) was not significantly different from that in Danes (6.3mg/dl; [95% CI 5.2-7.0]), whereas the 90th percentile was significantly higher among Danes: 46.36mg/dl; [95% Cl 43.0-54.3] vs. 27.6mg/dl [95% CI 20.7-36.9]. In 20% of the Danes, but in only 8% of the Eskimos (P = 0.009), the concentration of Lp(a) exceeded 30mg/dl. The difference is probably explained by a low frequency of the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotypes among Eskimos, since the apo(a) isoforms F and B were absent, and the S1 and S2 types were present in only 3.3% of Eskimos.

Apo(a) has several genetically determined phenotypes differing in molecular weight, to which Lp(a) concentrations in plasma are inversely correlated, and plasma Lp(a) concentrations above 20-30 mg dl-1 are an independant risk factor for ischaemic heart disease (IHD). To investigate whether Lp(a) could be important for the high cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), we determined Lp(a) concentrations and phenotypes in a group of 108 men (median age 32 years) with IDDM without nephropathy. A group of 40-year-old men (n = 466) served as controls. The median Lp(a) concentration was 7.4 mg dl-1 [95% CI 4.9 to 11.7] in the diabetic patients and 6.3 mg dl-1 [95% CI 5.2 to 7.0] in controls. The Lp(a) concentration exceeded 30 mg dl-1 in 22% of IDDM patients and in 20% of controls (P = 0.13). Moreover, the distribution of apo(a) phenotypes did not differ between patients and control. Lp(a) levels and apo(a) phenotypes are thus apparently the same in IDDM patients without nephropathy and controls. These findings do not exclude the possibility that Lp(a) may be increased in patients with nephropathy in whom coronary artery disease frequently co-exist or that Lp(a) in a given concentration is more atherogenic in IDDM patients than in persons without IDDM.","apolipoprotein(a); insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; lipoprotein(a)","apolipoprotein; lipoprotein; adult; article; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; male; priority journal; Apolipoproteins; Comparative Study; Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Human; Lipoprotein(a); Male; Phenotype; Radioimmunoassay; Reference Values; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"Apolipoproteins; Lipoprotein(a)",,,,,"Faergeman, O.; Dept. of Medicine and Cardiology A, Arhus Amtssygehus University Hosp., DK-8000 Arhus C, Denmark",,,,,,,,00142972,,EJCIB,1425859,"English","EUR.

Apo(a) has several genetically determined phenotypes differing in molecular weight, to which Lp(a) concentrations in plasma are inversely correlated. LDL and apo B levels are often elevated in untreated hypothyroidism and lowered by thyroxine (T4) treatment, probably due to an increase in LDL receptors. We measured plasma concentrations of LDL, apo B, and Lp(a) in 13 patients with symptomatic primary hypothyroidism before and during T4 therapy. The mean concentration of LDL decreased significantly (P = .006) from 6.05 mmol/L to 4.07 mmol/L, and the mean concentration of apo B decreased significantly (P = .005) from 1.42 g/L to 1.12 g/L. Median Lp(a) concentrations remained unchanged (P = .77); they were 17.05 mg/dL before and 16.59 mg/dL during T4 treatment. In both the untreated condition and during substitution therapy, Lp(a) levels were higher in patients than in healthy controls, probably due to a relatively high frequency of the small Lp(a) phenotypes in our patients. Since Lp(a) contains apo B, which is a ligand for the LDL receptor, it is surprising that Lp(a) is not reduced along with LDL and apo B.

DAVIT I was an early intervention trial that demonstrated a statistically nonsignificant reduction in mortality and reinfarction after 6 months of treatment. DAVIT II was a later intervention trial that demonstrated a nonsignificant reduction in the 18-month mortality rate [p = 0.11, hazard ratio 0.80; 95% confidence limits (CL) 0.61 to 1.05], a significant reduction in the reinfarction rate (p = 0.04, hazard ratio 0.77; CL 0.58 to 1.03), and in the major event rate (p = 0.03, hazard ratio 0.80; CL 0.64 to 0.99) in the verapamil group compared with the placebo group.

The drugs used were a β1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol, a nonselective β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, and a cardioselective, partial β1-adrenoceptor agonist with 43% ISA activity, xamoterol. The duration of exercise was smaller on propranolol. Maximum exercise heart rate and blood pressure were reduced significantly by propranolol and atenolol. Xamoterol reduced maximum exercise heart rate and had no effect on blood pressure. The degree of breathlessness and fatigue revealed no differences between treatments. Recent evidence has suggested an association between hyperkalaemia and hypomagnesaemia with an increase in the occurrence of arrythmias following acute myocardial infarction. Exercise-induced hyperkalaemia has been suggested as a factor in sudden death. The results confirmed a rise in serum potassium during exercise and attenuation of the fall during recovery under β-adrenoceptor blockade. Xamoterol was no different from placebo in these respects.

One potential mechanism is that Alu sequences undergo homologous recombination, producing deletions or duplications of DNA segments on genomic DNA. In at least four cases (FH626, PO, JA and FH-DK3), a deletion of exon 5 of the LDL receptor gene has been reported. Only one of these (FH626) have so far been characterized in detail by sequence analysis and shown to involve two of the Alu repeated sequences, which are present in introns 4 and 5. We here report the complete characterization of FH-DK3 and show that the cross-over break points involve sequences similar, but not at identical positions in the 5' end, to those reported for FH626.

No significant difference between patients and controls was found in TABP, as assessed by Jenkins Activity Survey. The frequency of PV was surprisingly high among both patients and controls, but with no difference between groups. However, patients responded positively significantly more often to questions concerning the frequent occurrence of headaches, unexplained rapid heart beat, faintness, or spells of complete exhaustion, unhappiness, a sense of bodily deterioration, depression, anger, extreme shyness or sensitivity, or preference for loneliness. TABP and PV were present simultaneously in 13% of both patients and controls. Twenty-three per cent of patients and 46% of controls exhibited neither PV nor TABP (p<0.01). It is concluded that psychic vulnerability occurs predominantly among subjects not exhibiting the type-A behavioral pattern. Absence of these two behavioral traits is associated with low risk of CHD, whereas liability to negative emotions may prove to be associated with increased coronary risk. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","Acute myocardial infarction; Coronary heart disease; Coronary-prone behavior; Psychic vulnerability; Type-A behavior",,,,,,,,"Sihm, I.; Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Tage Hansensgade 2, DK-8000, Aarhus C, Denmark",,,"Informa Healthcare",,,,,08039488,,NJPYE,,"English","Nord.

All 331 individuals were unrelated Caucasians of Danish ancestry. There were no significant differences (p>0.05) in genotype distribution or allele frequencies between atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic individuals, but in the 85-year-olds, there was evidence (p<0.10) for a lower U-allele frequency in nonatherosclerotic women compared to atherosclerotic women. In nonatherosclerotic women, there was a significant decrease in U-allele frequency with age (60 to 85 years). This decrease does not prove conclusively, but is compatible with, the hypothesis that the U-allele predisposes to, or the L-allele protects against, atherosclerosis.

Normal men and women consumed formula diets containing 20% of calories as soy protein or casein, 27% as fat and 53% as carbohydrate in 2 crossover studies.

Following an initial reduction of plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels on all diets, the plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations stabilized. On low-cholesterol diets the concentration of each of the major lipoprotein classes were similar during the soy and the casein dietary periods. On cholesterol-enriched diets, the concentration of LDL-C stabilized at a 16% lower level on soy protein than on the casein diet (p less than 0.02), while the concentration of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was 16% higher (p less than 0.01). Since the difference in LDL-C (p less than 0.05) and in HDL-C (p less than 0.025) levels on casein and on soy protein diets were significantly greater on the high than on the low cholesterol intake, the findings indicate that the level of dietary cholesterol may determine whether plant and animal dietary proteins have similar or different effects on plasma LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations.",,"casein; fatty acid; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; soybean protein; vegetable protein; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; article; blood; caloric intake; cholesterol intake; comparative study; female; human; male; protein intake; Adult; Caseins; Cholesterol, Dietary; Comparative Study; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids; Female; Human; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, LDL Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, VLDL Cholesterol; Male; Middle Age; Soybean Proteins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vegetable Proteins",,"casein, 9000-71-9; soybean protein, 9010-10-0; Caseins; Cholesterol, Dietary; Dietary Proteins; Fatty Acids; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, LDL Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, VLDL Cholesterol; Soybean Proteins; Vegetable Proteins",,,,,"Meinertz, H.",,,,,,,,03014800,,,2130150,"English","J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025506881

The purpose was to evaluate the implications of a high-risk strategy based on the rather conservative Danish guidelines for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of various risk factors depends on age, but in all, 1% had diabetes mellitus, 5% had a family history of premature IHD, 50% were smokers, 21% were obese, 12% had systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg, 8% had diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mmHg and 14% had serum cholesterol greater than 7 mmol/l. Only 24% had none of these risk factors and there was a considerable clustering of risk factors in certain subgroups. Approximately 34%, varying from 17% of the younger to 49% of the older, required medical follow-up as part of the high risk strategy. We have estimated the required number of visits to a general practitioner, if all Danish men aged 20-59 years were screened within three years and approximately 30% required follow-up for five years, with three visits in the first year and one thereafter. The number of visits peaks at 450 visits per year during the third year, and a number of circumstances could reduce this figure considerably. Multifactorial models to estimate risk in connection with screening should be adopted to the Danish guidelines for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, and future guidelines for intervention should probably be integrated in such a multifactorial model. To practice preventive medicine, many physicians will need greater knowledge of dietary counselling.",,"adult; article; comparative study; coronary artery disease; Denmark; follow up; human; male; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Comparative Study; Coronary Disease; Denmark; English Abstract; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Male; Middle Age; Models, Statistical; Risk Factors",,,,,,,"Gerdes, L.U.",,,,,,,,00415782,,,2360294,"Danish","Ugeskr Laeger",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025705465

The mean values for all measurement were nearly identical with the two methods, and approximately 95% of the Reflotron-measurements were within an interval of +/- 0.7 mmol/l around the estimated true value.

The group suggests that doctors ordering lipid and lipoprotein analyses are offered the following: S-Cholesterol (total), substance conc., (fPt)S-Triglycerides, substance conc., S-HDL-cholesterol, substance conc., and (fPt)S-LDL-cholesterol, substance conc.

The analytical variations should be reduced to below 3% (calculated as the variation coefficient), and it is recommended that laboratories participate in external quality control systems at least four times annually by reporting at least two human reference materials with different concentrations. As the use of reference intervals dependent on age and sex, based on random samplings of the background population, are less informative, it is recommended to refer to cutoff values for the clinical decision.

Treatment with xamoterol and digoxin was compared in 19 patients with cardiac failure (NYHA class II-III). The study consisted of a short-term and a long-term phase. The former was a randomized, doubleblind, crossover study with 6-week treatment periods. In the 15 patients who completed this phase, there was no significant difference between exercise duration on digoxin and on xamoterol. Exercise duration increased on digoxin by 27% and on xamoterol by 17% relative to baseline. Comparing digoxin and xamoterol, maximum exercise heart rate (p&lt;0.001), blood pressure (p&lt;0.01), and the pressure-rate product during maximum exercise were significantly lower on xamoterol treatment. The systolic time interval was shorter on digoxin than on xamoterol (p&lt;0.001). No changes occurred in the echocardiographic parameters. After the short-term study, 13 patients were followed 3-6 months on the drug to which they had responded best (digoxin 7, xamoterol 6). The results of the short-term study were maintained during this period.

Plant protein diets appear, however, to be without effect on plasma lipoprotein levels in normal subjects. In the present study, we have examined whether the origin of the dietary protein, i.e. plant (soy) or animal (casein), affects the plasma lipoproteins in normolipidemic subjects when these proteins are presented as components of diets low in cholesterol and saturated fat. The study followed a crossover design. Five men and 5 women consumed liquid formula diets containing 20% of calories as casein or soy protein, 28% as fat (mainly monounsaturated), and 52% as carbohydrate; the intake of cholesterol was less than 100 mg per day. The two dietary periods, each of 1 month duration, were separated by an interim period of 1 month on self-chosen food. Following an initial 30% reduction of cholesterol and LDL plasma levels on both diets, the concentrations of each of the major lipoprotein classes (VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL2 and HDL3) were similar during the two experimental dietary periods. Body weights were essentially constant. Dietary soy protein and casein could not be distinguished in their effects on the plasma concentrations and chemical composition of the major lipoprotein classes in normolipidemic subjects. © 1988.","Apo A-I; apo B; Casein; Liquid formula diet; Plasma lipoprotein; Soy protein","casein; soybean protein; adult; aged; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled study; diet; human; lipid blood level; Adult; Apolipoproteins; Caseins; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, Dietary; Dietary Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Female; Human; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Age; Reference Values; Soybean Proteins; Soybeans; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Triglycerides; Vegetable Proteins",,"casein, 9000-71-9; soybean protein, 9010-10-0; Apolipoproteins; Caseins; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, Dietary; Dietary Proteins; Lipoproteins; Soybean Proteins; Triglycerides; Vegetable Proteins",,"mead johnson, United States",,"Crombie, McLoone, Smith, Thomson, Pedoe, International differences in coronary heart disease mortality and consumption of fish and other foodstuffs (1987) Eur.

One hundred and twenty-six patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to receive either doxazosin (n = 63) or atenolol (n = 63). The mean final dosages, administered once daily, to obtain 24-hour blood pressure (BP) control were doxazosin 12 mg (range 1 to 16) and atenolol 91.8 mg (range 50 to 100). Of 12 doxazosin and 7 atenolol patient withdrawals from the study, 7 doxazosin and 4 atenolol patients withdrew for treatment-related reasons. No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found after 20 weeks in changes from baseline in standing and sitting BPs measured 24 hours after administration. Sitting BP (systolic/diastolic) was reduced by 10.5 9.8 mm Hg after doxazosin treatment and by 10.9 10.7 mm Hg after atenolol therapy. Standing BP was reduced by 8.8 7.7 mm Hg after doxazosin administration and 9.7 9.3 mm Hg after treatment with atenolol. Supine BP was measured in a small cohort of the study population, and doxazosin had a smaller effect than atenolol. After 20 weeks of treatment, both drugs reduced heart rate with atenolol producing a statistically significantly greater decrease than doxazosin (standing, doxazosin 5 beats/min, atenolol 16.2 beats/ min, p &lt; 0.001; sitting, doxazosin 5 beats/min, atenolol 13.1 beats/min, p &lt; 0.001). Side effects were reported by 37 patients receiving doxazosin therapy and 34 patients receiving atenolol therapy. Atenolol treatment was associated with a median increase in serum concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides and a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level. Doxazosin was associated with changes in the opposite direction, the increase in HDL cholesterol level (+0.01 mmol/ liter) being statistically significantly different (p &lt; 0.01) from the corresponding decrease in the atenolol group (-0.13 mmol/liter). The antiatherogenic index (HDL/total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol) increased from 0.29 to 0.31 in the doxazosin group and decreased in the atenolol group from 0.31 to 0.27 (p &lt; 0.005). Once-daily administration of doxazosin and atenolol produced similar and clinically relevant decreases in BP. The safety profiles of doxazosin and atenolol were similar. Doxazosin produced small but favorable changes in serum lipoprotein fractions that were statistically different from atenolol for the HDL cholesterol fraction and the antiatherogenic index. © 1987.",,"atenolol; cholesterol; doxazosin; high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; new drug; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; drug comparison; drug dose; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug therapy; heart; human; hypertension; lipoprotein blood level; major clinical study; oral drug administration; priority journal; therapy; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Atenolol; Clinical Trials; Double-Blind Method; Doxazosin; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypertension; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Prazosin",,"atenolol, 29122-68-7, 93379-54-5; cholesterol, 57-88-5; doxazosin, 74191-85-8; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents; Atenolol, 29122-68-7; Doxazosin, 74191-85-8; Lipoproteins; Prazosin, 19216-56-9",,,,"Medical Research Council Working Party, MRC trial of treatment of mild hypertension principal results (1985) BMJ, 291, pp. 97-104; The Australian therapeutic trial in mild hypertension (1980) Lancet, 1, pp. 1261-1269; Helgeland, Treatment of mild hypertension: a five year controlled drug trial.

Two approaches were made to evaluate the kinetics of metabolism of these LDL: (1) by serial measurements of radioactivity in serum, urine and the whole body; (2) by observing the density of the labelled LDL from serum using density-gradient ultracentrifugation. No significant change was seen in the modal density of the LDL in either the patient or the normal subjects, but there were changes in the skewness of the radioactivity peaks. This contrasts with previously published findings in the guinea pig, in which LDL radioactivity gradually accumulated in the densest particles. The guinea pig findings suggested that lipoproteins in the LDL region are structurally modified during their intravascular circulation. The present study indicates that modification leading to changes in density does not occur to any significant degree in the human, whose LDL represent the end product of intravascular metabolism of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. © 1981 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","Familial hypercholesterolaemia; Low-density lipoproteins; Metabolism","low density lipoprotein; case report; familial hypercholesterolemia; human cell; metabolism; Adult; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; Chemistry; Female; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Iodine Radioisotopes; Kinetics; Lipoproteins, LDL; Cavia porcellus; Sus scrofa",,"Iodine Radioisotopes; Lipoproteins, LDL",,,,,"Faergeman, O.; Department of Medicine B, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark",,,"Informa Healthcare",,,,,00365513,,SJCLA,7313509,"English","Scand.

The latter tissues contain in their capillary walls an enzyme, lipoprotein lipase, that hydrolyzes the triglyceride of chylomicrons and VLDL without removing the whole lipoprotein from the plasma. The resulting, progressively smaller 'remnant' lipoproteins are either removed from plasma in the liver or converted to low density lipoproteins (LDL), which in turn may be catabolized in non-hepatic tissues. High density lipoproteins (HDL) contain little triglyceride, but they do carry proteins serving as cofactors for lipoprotein lipase. HDL are also closely associated with lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a cholesterol esterifying enzyme of importance in plasma cholesterol transport. Prefaced by a brief discussion of lipoprotein structure and synthesis, the present review deals mainly with information and ideas about the catabolism of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.",,"lipoprotein; metabolism; plasma; review",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00016101,,AMSVA,,"English","ACTA MED.

Binding of bile acid to Questran, which contains about 45% cholestyramine, was fastest: concentration of unbound bile acid after 2 hours was less than 3 mM compared to about 5 mM in the solutions incubated with the other drugs, including Cuemid, which contains about 83% cholestyramine. After 24 hours, differences were less marked, but binding to Questran was still greatest. Glycocholic acid was least efficiently bound, especially to Secholex and Cuemid, The differences in rates of binding were unaffected by preincubation of the drugs with 1N HCl to simulate stomach conditions. Although differences between the cholestyramine components of Cuemid and Questran are not ruled out, it is possible that one or more of the other components of Questran significantly affect the in vitro binding of bile acids. Cholestyramine in the form of Questran may be the drug of choice in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, in which reduction of the bile acid pool is desirable.

When these lipoproteins were injected into recipient guinea pigs, the esterified 3H-cholesterol was rapidly cleared from the plasma; 24% was in the liver in 5 min and 54% in 15 min. A smaller fraction of the esterified cholesterol appeared in other plasma lipoprotein fractions, with 3H in the low density lipoproteins reaching a peak of 9%-18% of the injected esterified 3H-cholesterol between 30 and 60 min after the injection. The results indicate that most of the esterified cholesterol in very low density lipoproteins of guinea pig plasma is removed directly by the liver and a minor fraction is transferred to low density lipoproteins.

The B apoprotein separated from other apoproteins by delipidation and selective precipitation with tetramethylurea could not be distinguished from B apoprotein prepared by the conventional gel filtration technique. After injection of [3H]lysine, specific activity of B apoprotein was maximal in very low density and low density lipoproteins 1 and 1.5 h later, respectively, in a manner consistent with a precursor product relationship. When protein labeled very low density lipoproteins were injected into rats, the relationships of specific activity again indicated that B apoprotein of very low density lipoproteins may be the sole precursor of that of low density lipoproteins. However, less than 10% of the B apoprotein that disappeared from very low density lipoproteins appeared in low density lipoproteins. To evaluate the sites of removal of B apoprotein of very low density lipoproteins from plasma, protein labeled very low density lipoproteins were incubated with unlabeled high density lipoproteins to reduce radioactivity in non B apoproteins selectively by molecular exchange. Most of the B apoprotein was rapidly removed by the liver.

After 15 min, 71% of the injected esterified [3H]cholesterol had been taken up by the liver, where it was rapidly hydrolyzed.

Both uptake in the liver and transfer to low density lipoproteins occurred without change of distribution of 3H in the various cholesteryl esters. 3H appearing in esterified cholesterol of high density lipoproteins (d&gt;1.063) was derived from esterification, presumably by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, of simultaneously injected free [3H]cholesterol.

For studies with lymph lipoproteins, recipient animals were injected with 4 aminopyrazolopyrimidine 18 h before injection of lipoprotein to prevent secretion of very low density lipoproteins into their blood plasma. In all cases, most of the triglycerides (labeled with 14C) were rapidly metabolized, whereas cholesteryl esters (labeled with 3H) persisted in the blood. Most of the cholesteryl esters remained in smaller 'remnant' lipoproteins, less dense than 1.006, which retained an apparently spherical shape, as determined by electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations. Whereas the diameters and chemical compositions of large chylomicrons were substantially different from those of small chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins, all remnants were similar in these respects. Average remnant diameters were 400-600 Å and remnants were enriched in cholesteryl esters and in protein insoluble in tetramethylurea. In addition to triglycerides, remnants were depleted of phospholipids and tetramethylurea soluble proteins with rapid electrophoretic mobility. When related to particle size, the composition of remnants, like that of their precursors, was consistent with the 'pseudomicellar' model of lipoproteins, in which a core of nonpolar lipids is covered by a monolayer of polar lipids and protein. These results demonstrate the fundamental similarity of the initial step in the metabolism of triglyceride rich lipoproteins from intestinal mucosa and liver and show that loss of triglycerides from the core of the particles is accompanied by removal of polar components from the surface.",,"chylomicron; lipoprotein; protein; radioisotope; triacylglycerol; evisceration; intestine; liver; lymph; plasma; rat; theoretical study; triacylglycerol c 14; Animal; Cholesterol; Chylomicrons; Intestinal Mucosa; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, VLDL; Liver; Lymph; Male; Particle Size; Phospholipids; Proteins; Rats; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Triglycerides",,"protein, 67254-75-5; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Chylomicrons; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, VLDL; Phospholipids; Proteins; Triglycerides",,,,,,,,,,,,,00219738,,JCINA,169294,"English","J.
