The results showed that the frequency of pollen dispersal (FPD) among flowers was significantly higher on the same cotton plant than on different ones (P < 0.01). The average FPD at a distance of 1 m from the dyed Bt cotton plot to its east, south, west and north was estimated to be 44.8%, 48.9%, 57.1% and 21.5%, respectively, and declined with increasing distance in the four directions. Within the range of 25 m, the distance and direction of pollen dispersal could affect FGF significantly (P <0.01), and FGF generally tended to decrease with increasing distance from the Bt cotton plot, with a frequency of 2.0% at the farthest distance of 25 m.","Gene flow; Monitoring; Pollen dispersal; Pollen grain dyeing; Transgenic Bt cotton","cotton; frequency analysis; gene flow; pollen; seed dispersal; transgenic plant; article; Bacillus thuringiensis; biological pest control; cotton; ecology; ecosystem; gene flow; genetics; physiology; pollen; transgenic plant; Bacillus thuringiensis; Ecology; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Gossypium; Pest Control, Biological; Plants, Genetically Modified; Pollen; Gossypium hirsutum",,,,,,"Baranger, A., Chevre, A.M., Eber, F., Effect of oilseed rape genotype on the spontaneous hybridization rate with a weedy species: An assessment of transgene dispersal (1995) Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 91, pp. 956-963; Chen, S., Wu, J.-Y., He, X.-L., Quantification using ELISA of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal protein expressed in the tissue of transgenic insect-resistant cotton (1997) Jiangsu Agricultural Sciences, 13 (3), pp. 154-156. , in Chinese; Chevre, A.M., Eber, F., Darmency, H., Assessment of interspecific hybridization between transgenic oilseed rape and wild radish under normal agronomic conditions (2000) Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 100, pp. 1233-1239; Dalton, R., Transgenic corn found growing in Mexico (2001) Nature, 413, p. 337; Eijlander, R., Stiekema, W.J., Biological containment of potato ( Solanum tuberosum)-outcrossing to the related wild-species black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) and Bittersweet (Solanum dulcamara) (1994) Sexual Plant Reproduction, 7, pp. 29-40; Ellstrand, N.C., When transgenes wander, should we worry?

Results show at the germination stage, ARG was much weaker than n-ARG and Su 3 in resistance to high temperature and water stress, and similar to n-ARG but weaker than Su 3 in resistance to salt stress. At the seedling stage, given temperature stress(high -40 °C low - 15 °C) and water stress (flood and drought), ARG showed no advantage in height and biomass, and on the contrary, some disadvantages in certain conditions. For example, under a slight drought (relative water content 55%), ARG was obviously less than n-ARG in dry weight of the overground part, and also weaker than n-ARG and Su 3 in salt tolerance. The research shows the herbicide-tolerant transgenic soybean ARG is rather weak in competitiveness and invasiveness under stress conditions.","Moisture; Salinity; Seedling; Temperature; Tolerant to glyphosate; Transgenic soybean","cultivar; germination; moisture; salinity; seedling; soybean; temperature; transgenic plant; water stress; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Glycine max",,,,,,"(1999), pp. 30-33. , Chinese source(2001), (4), pp. 22-24. , Chinese source(2002), (2), pp. 41-42. , Chinese source(1999), 17 (5), pp. 25-27. , Chinese source(2002), 22 (11), pp. 1951-1959. , Chinese sourceKjar, C., Damgaard, C., Kjellsson, G., Ecological Risk Assessment of Genetically Modified Higher Plants (GMHP) (1999), pp. 1-33. , [M].

All kinds of reactions about hydrolysis, polymerization, flocculation and precipitation of soluble Al occurring in aqueous systems, soil solutions and on the interface of water and mineral have been systematically summarized including: Al polymerization via coalescence of the hexamer units according to the ""gibbsite-fragment"" model. The proposed structure of various polymeric Al species according to the ""core-link"" model will be made. The effects of some important parameters, such as the sort of clay minerals, the OH-/Al molar ratios, the type and amount of different complexing anions, as well as the temperature will also be examined. All kinds of hydroxyl monomer and polymer species of Al, their methods of measurement, thermodynamic stability and structures will be summarized, appraised and tabulated.",,,,,,,,"Fuente, J.M., Rodriguez, V.R., Ponce, J.L.C., Estrella, L.H., (1997) Science, 276, pp. 1568-1568; Desroches, S., Dayde, S., Berthon, G., (2000) J.
