At the same time, there appears to be (particularly in government circles) a marked reluctance to fully operationalize the complex concepts embodied in the Resource Management Act 1991. There has been a deliberate withdrawal from confronting some of the more radical and progressive notions contained within the Act in favour of a narrowly circumscribed, effects-based interpretation of the legislation founded on neoliberal ideology. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.",,"environmental legislation; legislative implementation; Resource Management Act (1991); New Zealand",,,,,,"Barbier, E.B., The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development (1987) Environmental Conservation, 14 (2), pp. 101-110; Caldwell, L.K., (1984) International Environmental Policy: Emergence and Dimensions, , Duke University Press, North Carolina; Caldwell, L.K., (1990) Between Two Worlds, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Clark, C.W., The Economics of Overexploitation (1974) Science, 181, pp. 630-634; Daly, H.E., Cobb, J.B., (1989) For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy Towards Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future, , Beacon Press, Boston; Devall, B., Session, G., (1985) Deep Ecology: Living As if Nature Mattered, , Peregrine Smith, Salt Lake City; Eckersley, R., (1992) Environmentalism and Political Theory: Toward An Ecocentric Approach, , State University of New York Press, Albany; Eckersley, R., Green versus Ecosocialist Economic Programmes: The Market rules OK?

The RMA swept away the entire tradition of town and country planning which New Zealand had inherited from Britain, replacing this with an integrated framework for resource management that attempts to emphasize efficiency, sustainability and public participation in the new system of development control. These new emphases of the RMA reflect the agendas of New Zealand's green and New Right lobbies which gained political influence during the 1980s. However, the green and neo-liberal agendas which the RMA attempts to embrace are potentially contradictory. In this paper we investigate this potential contradiction through a preliminary assessment of the first five year's of the new legislation's implementation. In particular, we focus on the operational success, or otherwise, of three 'efficiency' innovations of the RMA, and consider the consequences of these for the environmental and public participation ideals of the legislation.",,"environmental planning; legislative impact; planning legislation; New Zealand",,,,,,"Alexandra, J., (1994) New Zealand Legislates for Sustainable Development: Lesson for Australia, , Melbourne, Australian Conservation Foundation; Altvater, E., (1993) The Future of the Market: An Essay on the Regulation of Money and Nature after the Collapse of 'Actually Existing Socialism', , London, Verso; Anderson, A.J., The chronology of colonization in New Zealand (1991) Antiquity, 65, pp. 767-795; Ballantyne, B., Bang, B., Satisfaction and ideology: The Resource Management Act three years on (1995) Environmental Perspectives, MAY, pp. 1-4; Bang, B., (1992) Aspects of Local Government Planning in New Zealand: A Study of the Dunedin City Council, , unpublished PhD thesis (Dunedin, University of Otago); Banks, G., The Resource Management Act (1992) Changing Places in New Zealand: A Geography of Restructuring, , S.

This article critically analyses this claim to progress. It is proposed that the Resource Management Act 1991 is, in fact, the product of conflicting political economic agendas (neoliberalism and environmentalism) and that the development and implementation of the new legislation exhibits this inherent contradiction. By use of two examples, we illustrate the conflicts that arise in specific land use policy settings.
