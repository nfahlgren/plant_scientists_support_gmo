The case analyzed is that of Crisoperla, an association located in Italy, between Tuscany and Liguria, which involves organic farmers, social farming and fishermen cooperatives, consumers’ groups and association and agronomists. The analysis is based on the empirical data collected in the 3-year European project SOLINSA (FP7, 2011–2014). The focus is on the role of organic farming and organic food as a boundary object, a binder element around which actors involved work in order to develop common visions, languages and goals and organize their activities. These processes are, in fact, at the basis of the organizational consolidation of the association as well as of the growth of its political awareness and its willingness and capacity to interact with the outside both at local and higher levels. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Boundary object; Innovation networks; Local development; Organic farming; Organic food networks",,,,,,,"Bassi, I., Zaccarin, S., De Stefano, D., Rural inter-firm as basis for multifunctional local system development: evidence from an Italian alpine area (2014) Land Use Policy, 38, pp. 70-79; Brunori, G., Rossi, A., Malandrin, V., Co-producing transition: innovation processes in farms adhering to solidarity-based purchase groups (GAS) in Tuscany, Italy (2011) Int J Sociol Agric Food, 18 (1), pp. 28-53; Brunori, G., Rossi, A., Guidi, F., On the new social relations around and beyond food.

The ultimate goal is to investigate the impact of local factors for improving the policy targeting. Indicators of spatial association and a spatial econometrics model were performed for the analysis. The results show regional agglomeration effects of the rate of participants to the measures adopted to promote organic farming. In addition, a spatial relation among the farms that obtain public support is found, highlighting that the diffusion of participation is driven mainly by imitation process and external economies of scale.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Boundary work in LINSA is analysed on the basis of six case studies carried out in SOLINSA project under a common methodology. In developing typologies of boundary work and objects, a grounded approach is used. Findings: LINSA analysis demonstrates the dynamic character, diverse forms and multiple functions of boundary work and objects in three domains: learning, innovation, and sustainability. Addressing specific types of goals and actors leads to specific types of boundary work and boundary objects. Context-appropriate boundary work allows aligning differing actor attitudes, gaining increased external support, and developing LINSA. The concepts of boundary work and boundary objects are relevant in a broad range of divergent LINSA settings. Boundary work has its limitations, but its facilitation supports reaching LINSA goals. Practical Implications: The paper proposes recognising context-appropriate forms of boundary work and skilful use of emerging boundary objects to both promote internal consolidation of LINSA and effective external communication to foster learning and innovation for sustainability. Originality/Value: The paper provides insights into the forms, dynamic and outcomes of boundary work in LINSA in three key domains: developing shared knowledge base, co-producing innovation and negotiating sustainability. © 2014, © 2014 Wageningen University.","Boundary objects; Boundary work; Innovation; Learning; LINSA; Sustainability",,,,,,"266306, EC, European Commission","Bruckmeier, K., Tovey, H., Knowledge in Sustainable Rural Development: From Forms of Knowledge to Knowledge Processes (2008) Sociologia Ruralis, 48 (3), pp. 313-329; Brunori, G., Barjolle, D., Dockes, S., Helmle, J., Ingram, L., Klerkx, H., Moshitz, G., Tisenkopfs, T., CAP Reform and Innovation: The Role of Learning and Innovation Networks (2013) Eurochoices, 12 (2), pp. 27-33; Carolan, M.S., Social Change and the Adoption and Adaptation of Knowledge Claims: Whose Truth Do You Trust in Regard to Sustainable Agriculture?

The common agricultural policy (CAP) has been one of the main drivers of farmers' behavioural changes and represents the main agricultural policy instrument to address viability of rural areas and maintaining the profitability of the agricultural sector. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate towards CAP reform, this paper will provide an empirical model to simulate the impact of an alternative CAP mechanism on the provision of renewable energy. By applying a dynamic mathematical programming model, the paper tests the impact that new policy measures will have on the provision of a second-generation of bio fuel crops that represent a relevant option for Tuscan farmers. Results show that CAP reform positively impacts the supply of energy crops mainly due to the introduction of greening payments, which allows an enlarging of crop diversification. Model results stress also the income stabilisation effects of energy production introduction at farm level, due to reduction of farm exposure to market prices fluctuations. © 2015 by the authors.","Biogas; Common agricultural policy; Energy production; Farm household model; Mathematical programming model; Real options; Short rotation coppice","Biogas; Crops; Dynamic programming; Mathematical programming; Rural areas; Common agricultural policy; Energy productions; Farm-household models; Mathematical programming models; Real Options; Short rotation coppice; Agriculture",,,,,,"Wuebbles, D.J., Atul, K.J., Concerns about climate change and the role of fossil fuel use (2001) Fuel Process.

The issue of urban food security emerges as a key policy goal. This goal can be achieved through the coordination of a series of policies including territorial planning, commerce regulation, public procurement, health prevention and waste management. This paper discusses an example of how new narratives linking consumption to the environment-namely 'quality turn' and 'sufficiency' narratives-can help achieve more sustainable landscapes when implemented into food policies. Through the proposed approach, education, information and communication are seen as keys to change. The new approach may have important effects on landscape, and on the relationship between cities and the adjoining countryside. © 2014 © 2014 Landscape Research Group Ltd.","food; narratives; sustainable landscape; urban food policies","demand-side management; food policy; food security; landscape change; planning method; policy approach; territorial planning; urban area",,,,,,"Allen, P., Reweaving the food security safety net: Mediating entitlement and entrepreneurship (1999) Agriculture and Human Values, 16, pp. 117-129; Berman, E., Promoting food security: The community food security coalition (2011) Journal of Agricultural & Food Information, 12, pp. 221-231; Berry, W., (1990) What are people for?, , New York, NY,: North Point Press; Born, B., Purcell, M., Avoiding the local trap: Scale and food systems in planning research (2006) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 26, pp. 195-207; Boulanger, P., (2010) Three strategies for sustainable consumption, , http://sapiens.revues.org/1022, September, S.A.P.I.EN.S.

School meal services have a high resonance in the debate on collective catering services because of the implications on the education to sustainable dietary habits and the orientation of the production system. This contribution focuses on the reciprocal relationship between professionals and users of school meal services as a driver to mobilize new resources-according to the theory of co-production-that steer service innovation and a shift towards more sustainable practices. We illustrate this through a case study on the school meal system in Pisa (Italy), where the Canteen Committee represents an institutional arena for participation and empowerment of actors that has gradually gained a central role in shaping this school meal service. Despite the challenges and obstacles, the institutionalized co-production of services allows consolidation of trust among key players and the introduction of innovations in the service, in the form of several projects oriented to sustainability which would not take place without the joint effort of actors involved, parents in the first place. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Civic food networks; Co-production; Public private partnerships; School meals; Social innovation; Sustainable diets; Sustainable public procurement","dietary shift; food availability; resource development; schooling behavior; social policy; sustainability; Italy; Pisa [Tuscany]; Tuscany",,,,,,"Sonnino, R., Quality food, public procurement, and sustainable development.

In this article, different 'clusters' of definitions are considered, alternatively biotechnologies, biomass, and biochemical and biophysical processes as key criteria for identification. It is argued that none of these definitions properly address the issue of sustainability. In fact, a 'broad' definition of bioeconomy, encompassing all biochemical and biophysical processes, would make it useless for policy purposes. The article proposes building a definition of the bioeconomy around the concept of biovalue. It identifies the goal of the bioeconomy as the capacity to mobilise science to obtain high biovalue returns from low-cost living matter, for example organic waste, and includes the value of non-market goods associated with agriculture and food. In this regard, a distinction is made between 'natural biovalue', produced by quality agriculture, and 'biotechnological biovalue'. It is argued that the bioeconomy and the production of natural biovalue deserve specific attention and that a sustainable bioeconomy should not undermine the potential of natural biovalue through competition for the same land and water resources. © 2013 The Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists.",,"biomass; biotechnology; innovation; sustainability; technology policy",,,,,,"(2001) The European bioeconomy in 2030.

We identify three phases of this evolution: in the first phase, from the end of the Second World War to the end of the 1980s, the 'modernization' frame, with its emphasis on productivity and the industrial organization of production, dominates in a context populated mainly by agricultural actors. A second phase, characterised by the 'turn to quality', encourages the development of a 'Made in Italy food consensus'. In this phase, food security mainly concerns food safety and conservation of national food identity. The third phase is characterised by a response to the pressures generated by the 2006-2008 food crisis and the subsequent recession. In this phase food security becomes a key element of a new consensus frame, which links together pieces of discourse that often existed in separate fields of activity and policy. The analysis is carried out within a conceptual framework that focuses attention on the co-evolution between discourse and discursive coalitions in a progressive overlapping between 'public sphere' and 'market sphere'. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Discourse; Food security; Made in Italy; Market sphere; Public sphere","conceptual framework; food market; food safety; food security; productivity; public sector; Italy",,,,,,"Allen, P., Reweaving the food security safety net: mediating entitlement and entrepreneurship (1999) Agriculture and Human Values, 16 (2), pp. 117-129; Ansell, C.K., Vogel, D., (2006) What's the Beef?: the Contested Governance of European Food Safety, , MIT Press, Cambridge (MA); Bagdonis, J.M., Hinrichs, C.C., Schafft, K.A., The emergence and framing of farm-to-school initiatives: civic engagement, health and local agriculture (2009) Agriculture and Human Values, 26 (1-2), pp. 107-119; (2010) Le sfide della food security, , http://www.barillacfn.com/uploads/file/72/1259610262_PositionPaperBCFN_Food-Security.pdf, Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, (accessed May 2011), Barilla CFN; (2010) L'agricoltura OGM è sostenibile?

Drawing on a survey of ongoing initiatives at national level and on evidence from empirical fieldwork in a specific territorial context showing a variegated and dynamic reality at this regard (Tuscany), the article analyses consumers' evolving attitudes and behaviour, around and even beyond food, unfolding during their involvement in these initiatives. In particular, it focuses on the experience of the solidarity-based purchasing groups, consumers' organisations promoted by groups of citizens aiming at getting control of the food they consume. Using an actor-network perspective, the article analyses how purchasing and consumption routines change when consumers join these initiatives. The article also discusss the potential of these initiatives as drivers of change along with the following questions: to what extent do these initiatives challenge dominant food practices and system governance? On what basis are these initiatives sustainable and are replicable in different contexts? How can they foster other forms of civic engagement? In this regard, the article tests a transition management approach, considering solidarity-based purchasing groups as socio-technical niches within broader socio-technical regimes in a macro landscape characterised by the globalisation of the food system. In particular, it analyses the critical points where niches enter in conflict with existing socio-technical regimes, and the way in which these groups act to remove legal, technological and cultural barriers to their development. © 2011 The Authors.

The challenges ahead for the European agri-food system differ in their complexity, scale and speed to those we have faced in the past, pointing to a new level of change. The interconnections between these combined challenges and the limited understanding of the various feedback loops linking them, contribute to uncertainty about future developments. There is growing evidence, however, that these challenges are so large that a 'business-as usual' approach is not an option and that transformative change is needed which will open up a window for innovation, new ideas and new paradigms. Three pathways have been identified to guide the transition to a sustainable agri-food system: consumption changes, technological innovation and organisational innovation. To make the transition successful, research and innovation programmes should be transformed in order to tackle these challenges and to produce the necessary system innovations. Diversity of approaches and paradigms, transdisciplinarity, experimentation in both the technological and social realm and coordination should be promoted in the design of the research and innovation programmes. © 2011 The Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists.",,"agricultural research; European Union; food consumption; food production; innovation; sustainable development",,,,,,"(2009), FAO.

It argues that a consistent and satisfactory conceptual framework for studying the supply of MFA at farm and territorial level is still largely lacking and that, when consistently applied, the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture fundamentally challenges the ways in which agricultural activities are observed, analysed and their effects assessed. This is elaborated by discussing five 'critical questions' for studying the supply of MFA: (1) what are relevant functions of agriculture? (2) how to define agricultural activities? (3) how to identify relevant farm/firm categories? (4) how to study the role of changing rural identities? and (5) what is the role of new territorial and institutional arrangements?

The case we have analysed underlines the importance for the organic sector to find innovative organisational patterns in order to meet the challenges entailed with the process of growth and development while preserving the authenticity of the values embedded in a traditional - even not organic - production system.

Through a 'post-rural' approach, this paper aims to analyse an attempt to reconfigure patterns of governance taking place in a well-known rural area, the Chianti (Tuscany, Italy). The Chianti can be considered as a typical example of a post-rural area, characterised by a highly complex civil society, with a large number of organisations representing their constituencies' interests, which strongly characterise the local social and economic processes. In this area wine is the most important industry, both for its weight in terms of added value and employment but also for the multiplier effects that its reputation has on the overall economy, and local wine elites have historically had a strong hold on local society. Along with rural change leading to social and economic diversification and growing administrative complexity, the dominance of wine elites is challenged by a coalition of actors led by the mayors of the local municipalities. The resulting struggle for hegemony is played out through an intense inside/outside interaction, which contributes to continuous attempts to redefine local identities. The paper explores the role that the building of social representations of rurality by local elites plays in the creation of new rural governance patterns in the area. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In most of the cases, rural development in these areas depends not only on the capacity of rural communities to mobilise endogenous resources, but also to be able to link endogenous resources with outside networks. In Italy this approach has widely been put into practice through strategies centred on the link between local food and its place of production. To explore the implications of this link, the paper will explore the implication of an adoption of the concept of 'terroir'. Terroir can be seen as a mix of a set of localised invariants in the space related to natural, cultural, and social spheres. It is highly specific of a place, as it is produced and reproduced through localised processes. The peculiarity of the 'terroir' is that it is embodied into the product, which means that it is the source of local products' identity and specificity. Local products are then a component of a broader socio-technical system, and product and terroir co-evolve. What are the mechanisms that make local products keys to rural development in a neo-endogenous perspective? In a neo-endogenous perspective, valorisation of local products is mainly related to its capacity to be recognised and evaluated by outside observers as different (and possibly better) from others. This capacity is embodied into what Bourdieu calls symbolic capital. Symbolic capital becomes a thread linking 'terroir' and the product to external observers, and convey to them meanings like notoriety, reputation, and trust. In order to be able to create, maintain, and increase symbolic capital, rural communities activate communication practices within and outside themselves. This may generate conflicts as well as strengthen identities and alliances. Three case studies will show the network building processes related to the creation of symbolic capital and its mobilisation into food production and marketing. The Cutigliano case shows how a small community borrows symbolic capital from the outside to enhance its capacity to sell a local cheese outside the area. The Colonnata case shows the risk that neo-endogenous strategies generate interlocal conflicts, hampering its competitiveness as a whole. The Chianti case shows an internal conflict over the use of the symbolic capital with both positive effects on the public debate and potential negative effects on the cohesion of the area. All the three cases make possible a reflection on governance, and especially on the role of the state (or the regional administration) in the governance of these processes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The impressive economic impact that the establishment of the Costa degli Etruschi wine route has had on the farms involved is traced back in this article to the collective action that produces synergies and coherence. Synergies can be defined as linkages between two or more entities, whose joint effort produces quantitatively and qualitatively higher effects than those produced by the efforts of the same entities alone. Coherence is a quality belonging to the elements that constitute the context of action in successful rural development practices: natural and man-made environment, social networks, and symbolic systems. The process of creating coherence is not without conflict, and the article contends that the establishment of coherence needs a hegemonic strategy that involves all sources of empowerment and particularly cultural codes.",,"collective action; rural development; rural economy; synergism; Italy",,,,,,"Amin, A., Thrift, N., Living in the global (1994) Globalization, Institutions and Regional Development in Europe, , A.
