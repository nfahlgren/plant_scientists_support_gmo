Sets of pure lines (no diversity), chosen for high yielding ability or high quality, were compared with line mixtures (intermediate level of diversity), and lines crossed with each other in composite cross populations (CCP<inf>n</inf>, high diversity). Additional populations containing male sterility genes (CCP<inf>ms</inf>) to increase outcrossing rates were also tested. Grain yield, grain protein content, and protein yield were measured at four sites (two organically-managed and two conventionally-managed) over three years, using seed harvested locally in each preceding year. CCP<inf>n</inf> and mixtures out-yielded the mean of the parents by 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively. These yield differences were consistent across genetic backgrounds but partly inconsistent across cropping environments and years. Yield stability measured by environmental variance was higher in CCP<inf>n</inf> and CCP<inf>ms</inf> than the mean of the parents. An index of yield reliability tended to be higher in CCP<inf>n</inf>, CCP<inf>ms</inf> and mixtures than the mean of the parents. Lin and Binns' superiority values of yield and protein yield were consistently and significantly lower (i.e. better) in the CCPs than in the mean of the parents, but not different between CCPs and mixtures. However, CCPs showed greater early ground cover and plant height than mixtures. When compared with the (locally non-predictable) best-yielding pure line, CCPs and mixtures exhibited lower mean yield and somewhat lower yield reliability but comparable superiority values. Thus, establishing CCPs from smaller sets of high-performing parent lines might optimize their yielding ability. On the whole, the results demonstrate that using increased within-crop genetic diversity can produce wheat crops with improved yield stability and good yield reliability across variable and unpredictable cropping environments. © 2015.","Composite cross population; Evolutionary breeding; Stability; Triticum aestivum","Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1961) Crop Sci., 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., Genetic changes associated with the evolution of adaptedness in cultivated plants and their wild progenitors (1988) J.

Here we identify the concept of resilience as a universally applicable and fundamentally important criterion of health in all relevant areas of agriculture. We discuss definitions of resilience for soils, plants, animals, humans and ecosystems, and explore ways in which resilience can be applied as a criterion of health in different agricultural contexts. We show how and why resilience can be seen as a key criterion of health. Based on this, we discuss how resilience can be used as a link between soil, plant, animal, human and ecosystem health. Finally, we highlight four key areas for future research on resilience in agriculture, namely spatial and temporal scaling of resilience; effects of diversity; the role of networks for resilience; and stakeholder involvement. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.","Agriculture; Concept; Health; Resilience; Stability; Stress","Animalia; Soil; adaptation, physiological; agriculture; animals; ecosystem; Food Supply; Health; Humans; Livestock; Plants; Soil; Adaptation, Physiological; Agriculture; Animals; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Health; Humans; Livestock; Plants; Soil",,"Soil",,,,"Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference (1946), New York, 19-22 June, 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948Hawkes, C., Ruel, M.T., International Food Policy Research Institute (2006), http://www.ifpri.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/publications/focus13_01.pdf, [Online].

Agroforestry, a land-use system that integrates trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock production, has been identified by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) as a 'win-win' approach that balances the production of commodities (food, feed, fuel, fiber, etc.) with non-commodity outputs such as environmental protection and cultural and landscape amenities. Evidence is now coming to light that supports the promotion of agroforestry in temperate developed countries as a sustainable alternative to the highly industrialized agricultural model with its associated negative environmental externalities. This paper reviews this evidence within the 'ecosystem services' framework to evaluate agroforestry as part of a multifunctional working landscape in temperate regions. Establishing trees on agricultural land can help to mitigate many of the negative impacts of agriculture, for example by regulating soil, water and air quality, supporting biodiversity, reducing inputs by natural regulation of pests and more efficient nutrient cycling, and by modifying local and global climates. The challenge now lies in promoting the adoption of agroforestry as a mainstream land use through research, dissemination of information and policy changes. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.","carbon sequestration; ecosystem services; silvoarable; silvopastoral; sustainability; trees","adaptive management; agricultural land; agroforestry; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental protection; land use; livestock farming; shrub; sustainability; tree",,,,,,"(2009) How to Feed the World in 2050.

Integrating trees and agriculture through agroforestry has been attracting increasing interest as an agroecological approach to sustainable intensification. Trees have traditionally been important elements of temperate agricultural systems around the world, but there has been increasing separation of agriculture, forestry and nature over the past few decades. This paper discusses what we can learn from traditional agroforestry systems to help develop modern systems that integrate ecological farming and agroecological advances to achieve sustainable intensification. We also discuss the existing barriers to wider adoption of agroforestry, and identify how these barriers can be overcome to promote agroforestry as a mainstream land-use system. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","agroecology; ecosystem services; food security; orchards; pollarding","agroecology; agroforestry; crop production; ecosystem service; food security; integrated approach; intensive agriculture; optimization",,,,,,"Pretty, J., Sutherland, W.J., Ashby, J., Auburn, J., Balucombe, D., Bell, M., Bentley, J., Pilgrim, S., The top 100 questions of importance to the future of global agriculture (2010) International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability, 8, pp. 219-236; Executive summary of the synthesis report (2008) International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development., , http://www.agassessment.org/docs/IAASTD_EXEC_SUMMARY_JAN_2008.pdf, IAASTD accessed January 16 2012; Lundgren, B., Introduction [Editorial] (1982) Agroforestry Systems, 1, pp. 3-6; Jose, S., Agroforestry for ecosystem services and environmental benefits: An overview (2009) Agroforestry Systems, 76, pp. 1-10; Smith, J., Pearce, B.D., Wolfe, M.S., Reconciling productivity with protection of the environment: Is temperate agroforestry the answer?

For many cultivated plants, however, organic seed is often not available. This is mainly because investment in organic plant breeding and seed production has been low in the past. To bridge the gap between organic seed supply and demand, national and European regulations define certain circumstances under which organic producers are permitted to use non-organically produced seed. While the organic sector currently depends on these concessions, they also threaten to impede a further increase in the demand for organic seed, thereby potentially restraining present and future investment in organic seed production and plant breeding. We review the current status of the organic seed regulations framework by analysing key issues such as the role of the national derogation regimes, the role of Expert Groups, databases and seed prices. Key points are that (a) the situation of the organic seed sector has improved over the last few years; however, (b) reporting on organic seed to the EU by different countries needs to be harmonised; (c) the success of the organic seed sector depends critically on the implementation and improvement of national Expert Groups; and (d) to protect genetic diversity, the use of local varieties and landraces should not be impeded by organic seed regulations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Conservation varieties; Europe; Organic; Policy; Regulation; Seed",,,,,,,"(2011) Options and analysis of possible scenarios for the review of the EU legislation on the marketing of seed and plant propagating material, p. 35. , http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/propagation/evaluation/index_en.htm, Anonymous, Accessed 23 July 2012; (2012) Seed diversity in need of help - open letter to the Members of the European Parliament, p. 2. , http://www.seedforall.org/files/openletters_pm.pdf, Arche Noah, ARC2020 Agricultural and Rural Convention, APRODEV Association of World Council of Churches related Development Organisations in Europe, Birdlife Europe, Euro Coop, ECVC European Coordination Via Campesina, EEB European Environmental Bureau, EPBA European Professional Beekeepers Association, Grain, IFOAM EU Group International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity, Accessed 4 May 2012; Baker, B., Commercial availability of organic seeds: certifier perspectives (2008) Proceedings of the 5th Organic Seed Growers Conference, pp. 55-60. , Salem, Oregon, USA, 14-15 February 2008; Bocci, R., Seed legislation and agrobiodiversity: conservation varieties (2009) J Agric Environ Int Dev, 103, pp. 31-49; Bocci, R., Chable, V., Les Réseaux Semences Paysannes en Europe et l'évolution des lois sur les semences-The peasant seeds network in Europe and the evolution of seed laws (2008) Cahiers D'études Et De Recherche Francophones/Agricultures, 17, pp. 216-221; Bocci, R., Ortolani, L., Micheloni, C., The seed sources of organic farmers in Italy (2011) The 17th IFOAM Organic World Congress: Organic Seed Preconference, pp. 172-176. , Cheongwon-gun, Korea: Heuksalim Institute; Boelt, B., Deleuran, L.C., Organic forage seed production (2000) IFOAM 2000: The world grows organic.

However, there is an extensive literature on general health definitions and health criteria in human medicine. Taking up ideas from these philosophical debates, concepts of plant health are reviewed and a framework developed to locate these concepts according to their position in several philosophical controversies. In particular, (i) the role of values in defining plant health in a naturalist versus a normativist approach; (ii) negative and positive definitions of plant health; (iii) reductionist versus holistic perspectives; (iv) the focus on functionality versus resilience, i.e. the ability of the plant to perform under stress with or without human interference; (v) materialist versus vitalist approaches; and (vi) biocentric versus anthropocentric views, are surveyed. The ways in which these perspectives relate to mainstream and alternative approaches to plant protection are explored and we suggest how the contradicting views might be reconciled. It is argued that none of these perspectives is without inherent contradictions, but that by combining contrasting approaches it is possible to provide a comprehensive though fuzzy concept. Rather than giving a new definition of plant health, a conceptual framework is developed that suggests what questions may be answered in debates on plant health issues and how such debates could be organized. © 2011 The Authors.

In a cycle of sowing and re-sowing seed from the plant population year after year, those plants favored under prevailing growing conditions are expected to contribute more seed to the next generation than plants with lower fitness. Thus, evolving crop populations have the capability of adapting to the conditions under which they are grown. Here we review the current state of research in evolutionary plant breeding and concentrate on the ability of evolving plant populations to deal with stressful, variable, and unpredictable environments. This resilience of evolving plant populations is seen as a major advantage under the predicted threats faced by agriculture such as global climate change. We have conducted an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this breeding approach and suggest how its concept can be broadened and expanded. Given the current legal restrictions for realizing the potential of evolutionary plant breeding, we call for a change in legislation to allow evolving crop populations to enter agricultural practice on a larger scale© 2011 by the authors.","Competition; Composite cross populations; Diversity; Farm-saved seed; Resilience",,,,,,,"Pimentel, D., Food for thought: A review of the role of energy in current and evolving agriculture (2011) Crit.

Assessments included grain yield, grain protein concentration, protein yield, disease incidence and green leaf area (GLA). The superiority of each cultivar (the sum of the squares of the differences between its mean in each environment and the mean of the best cultivar there, divided by twice the number of environments; CS) was calculated for yield, grain protein concentration and protein yield, and ranked in each environment. The yield and grain protein concentration CS were more closely correlated with cultivar release date at the non-organic sites than at organic sites. This difference may be attributed to higher yield levels with larger differences among cultivars at the non-organic sites, rather than to improved stability (i.e. similar ranks) across sites. The significant difference in the correlation of protein yield CS and cultivar age between organic and non-organic sites would support evidence that the ability to take up mineral nitrogen (N) compared to soil N has been a component of the selection conditions of more modern cultivars (released after 1989). This is supported by assessment of GLA, where more modern cultivars in the non-organic systems had greater late-season GLA, a trend that was not identified in organic conditions. This effect could explain the poor correlation between age and protein yield CS in organic compared to non-organic conditions where modern cultivars are selected to benefit from later nitrogen (N) availability which includes the spring nitrogen applications tailored to coincide with peak crop demand. Under organic management, N release is largely based on the breakdown of fertility-building crops incorporated (ploughed-in) in the previous autumn. The release of nutrients from these residues is dependent on the soil conditions, which includes temperature and microbial populations, in addition to the potential leaching effect of high winter rainfall in the UK. In organic cereal crops, early resource capture is a major advantage for maximizing the utilization of nutrients from residue breakdown. It is concluded that selection of cultivars under conditions of high agrochemical inputs selects for cultivars that yield well under maximal conditions in terms of nutrient availability and pest, disease and weed control. The selection conditions for breeding have a tendency to select cultivars which perform relatively better in non-organic compared to organic systems. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.",,"crop production; crop yield; cultivar; leaf area; nutrient availability; protein; soil nitrogen; spatiotemporal analysis; weed control; wheat; United Kingdom; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Addisu, M., Snape, J.W., Simmonds, J.R., Gooding, M.J., Reduced height (Rht) and photoperiod in-sensitivity (Ppd) allele associations with establishment and early growth of wheat in contrasting production systems (2009) Euphytica, 166, pp. 249-267; Addisu, M., Snape, J.W., Simmonds, J.R., Gooding, M.J., Effects of reduced height (Rht) and photo-period insensitivity (Ppd) alleles on performance of wheat in different production systems (2010) Euphytica, 172, pp. 169-181; Austin, R.B., Yield of wheat in the United Kingdom: Recent advances and prospects (1999) Crop Science, 39, pp. 1604-1610; Baresel, J.-P., Zimmermann, G., Reents, H.J., Effect of genotype and environment on N uptake and N partition in organically grown winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Germany (1998) Euphytica, 163, pp. 347-354; Baresel, J.-P., Reents, H.-J., The pattern of N uptake in time, N translocation and root growth as possible factors determining genotyperenvironment interactions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)

An interdisciplinary network of European scientists put forward visions for future crop production embracing the complexity of our socio-ecological system by applying the principle of diversity at all levels from soil micro-organisms to plant varieties and cropping systems. This approach, integrated with careful deployment of our finite global resources and implementation of appropriate sustainable technology, appears to be the only way to ensure the scale of system resilience needed to cope with many of our concerns. We discuss some of the most important tools such as (i) building soil fertility by recycling of nutrients and sustainable use of other natural and physical resources, (ii) enhancing biological diversity by breeding of crops resilient to climate change and (iii) reconnecting all stakeholders in crop production. Finally, we emphasise some of the changes in agricultural and environmental regulation and policy needed in order to implement the visions. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.",,,,,,,,"Long, S., Ainsworth, E., Leakey, A., Nösberger, J., Ort, D., Food for thought: Lower-than-expected crop yield stimulation with rising CO2 concentrations (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1918-1921; Kiers, E.T., Leakey, R.R.B., Izac, A.-M., Heinemann, J.A., Rosenthal, E., Nathan, D., Agriculture at a crossroads (2008) Science, 320, pp. 320-321; Pimentel, D., Pimentel, M., Global environmental resources versus world population growth (2006) Ecol Econ, 59, pp. 195-198; Costanza, R., D'arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 253-260; (2005) Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Biodiversity Synthesis, , Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, World Resources Institute, Washington, DC; (2002) Harvesting Energy with Fertilizers, , http://cms.efma.org/EPUB/easnet.dll/ExecReq/Page?eas:template_im=000BC2&eas:dat_im=000C23, European Fertilizer Manufacturers Association, [Online], Available, [17 December 2008]; Lal, R., Anthropogenic influences on world soils and implications to global food security (2007) Adv Agron, 93, pp. 69-93; Tan, Z.X., Wiebke, K.D., Lal, R., Global soil nutrient depletion and yield reduction (2005) J Sustain Agric, 26, pp. 123-146; Holland, J.M., The environmental consequences of adopting conservation tillage in Europe: Reviewing the evidence (2004) Agric Ecosyst Environ, 103, pp. 1-25; Lal, R., Managing world soils for food security and environmental quality (2001) Adv Agron, 74, pp. 155-192; Oldeman, L.R., (1992) Global Extent of Soil Degradation, , International Soil and Information Center, Wageningen; Oldeman, L.R., Makkeling, R.T.A., Sombroek, W.G., (1992) World Map of the Status of Human-induced Soil Degradation: An Explanatory Note, , (2nd edn).

Data were derived at different scales ranging from field to landscape scale using a range of methods including: land manager questionnaires, habitat surveys and the use of large-scale landscape datasets. Organic farms were situated in inherently more diverse landscape types, had smaller field sizes, higher, wider and less gappy hedgerows subject to less frequent management, used rotational practices including grass, were more likely to be mixed farms and did not use artificial fertilisers and pesticides. Organic farms were associated with heterogeneous landscape types. However, even in such landscape types the organic farming system produced greater field and farm complexity than farms employing a non-organic system. The findings of the study point to the importance of organic farming systems for maintaining landscape and local complexity with consequent benefits for biodiversity in arable farming landscapes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Box 386, Wageningen 6700 AJ, Netherlands","The need for increased sustainability of performance in cereal varieties, particularly in organic agriculture (OA), is limited by the lack of varieties adapted to organic conditions. Here, the needs for breeding are reviewed in the context of three major marketing types, global, regional, local, in European OA. Currently, the effort is determined, partly, by the outcomes from trials that compare varieties under OA and CA (conventional agriculture) conditions. The differences are sufficiently large and important to warrant an increase in appropriate breeding. The wide range of environments within OA and between years, underlines the need to try to select for specific adaptation in target environments. The difficulty of doing so can be helped by decentralised breeding with farmer participation and the use of crops buffered by variety mixtures or populations. Varieties for OA need efficient nutrient uptake and use and weed competition. These and other characters need to be considered in relation to the OA cropping system over the whole rotation. Positive interactions are needed, such as early crop vigour for nutrient uptake, weed competition and disease resistance. Incorporation of all characteristics into the crop can be helped by diversification within the crop, allowing complementation and compensation among plants. Although the problems of breeding cereals for organic farming systems are large, there is encouraging progress. This lies in applications of ecology to organic crop production, innovations in plant sciences, and the realisation that such progress is central to both OA and CA, because of climate change and the increasing costs of fossil fuels. © 2008 The Author(s).","Crop diversity; Direct and indirect selection; Organic agriculture; Participatory plant breeding; Variety testing; Wide and specific adaptation",,,,,,,"Acciaresi, H.A., Chidichimo, H.O., Sarondon, S.J., Traits related to competitive ability of wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties against Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) (2001) Biol Agric Hortic, 19, pp. 275-286; Allard, R.W., Genetic changes associated with the evolution of adaptedness in cultivated plants and their wild progenitors (1988) J Hered, 79, pp. 235-238; Allard, R.W., The genetics of host-pathogen coevolution.

Recently, interest has increased in obtaining varieties specifically adapted to organic farming conditions. This raised the question if an independent system of trials may be required for this purpose. To help answering this question, through the exchange network of European cereal researchers SUSVAR ( www.cost860.dk ), a number of data sets of agronomic traits from barley, wheat and winter triticale, from trials performed in Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands, France, Switzerland, UK and Germany, were made available and analysed using an approach based on mixed models involving parameters describing genetic correlation between the two types of experiments, i.e., organic and non-organic (high or low input). Estimated variance components and correlations were used to evaluate response to selection and index selection. The response to index selection was analysed as a function of the fraction of available trials assigned to the organic system. The genetic correlations were interpreted in terms of ranking agreement. We found high genetic correlations between both systems for most traits in all countries. Despite high genetic correlations, the chances of very good agreement in observed rankings were moderate. Combining information from both organic and non-organic systems is shown to be beneficial. Further, ignoring information from non-organic trials when making decisions regarding performance under organic conditions is a sub-optimal strategy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Genetic correlation; Non-organic field trials; Organic field trials; Response to selection; Variance components","Hordeum; Triticosecale; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"(2007) Eurostat Newsrelease 80/2007-12 June 2007, , www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat, Anonymous Last visited 16 November 2007; Bos, I., Caligari, P., (2007) Selection Methods in Plant Breeding, , 2 Springer Berlin; Breslow, N.E., Clayton, D.G., Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models (1993) J Am Stat Assoc, 88, pp. 9-25; Burger, H., Scholen, M., Schmidt, W., Geiger, H.H., Quantitative genetic studies on breeding maize for adaptation to organic farming (2008) Euphytica, , doi: 10.1007/s10681-008-9723-4; Falconer, D.S., MacKay, T.F.C., (1996) Quantitative Genetics, , 4 Prentice Hall London; Kitchen, J.L., McDonald, G.K., Shepherd, K.W., Lorimer, M.F., Graham, D.R., Comparing wheat grown in South Australian organic and conventional farming systems. 1.

Habitat extent, composition and management on organic farms was likely to favour higher levels of biodiversity and indeed organic farms tended to support higher numbers of species and overall abundance across most taxa. However, the magnitude of the response varied; plants showed larger and more consistent responses than other taxa. Variation in response across taxa may be partly a consequence of the small size and isolated context of many organic farms.

Three experiments compared the late blight severity and progress in mixtures with that in pure stands. Disease on susceptible or moderately resistant varieties typical of those in commercial use was similar in mixtures and pure stands. In 2 of 3 years, there were slight reductions on cv. Sante, which is moderately susceptible, in mixture with cv. Cara, which is moderately resistant. Cara was unaffected by this mixture. Mixtures of an immune or near-immune partner with Cara or Sante substantially reduced disease on the latter. The effect of the size of plots of individual varieties or mixtures on blight severity was compared in two experiments. Larger plots had a greater area under the disease progress curve, but the average rate of disease progress was greater in smaller plots; this may be because most disease progress took place later, under more favourable conditions, in the smaller plots. In one experiment, two planting densities were used. Density had no effect on disease and did not interact with mixture effects. The overall conclusion is that, while mixtures of potato varieties may be desirable for other reasons, they do not offer any improvement on the average of the disease resistance of the components. © 2005 The Authors.","Disease management; Diversification; Genotype unit area; Monoculture; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum","disease resistance; disease severity; epidemic; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"Akem, C., Ceccarelli, S., Erskine, W., Lenne, J., Using genetic diversity for disease resistance in agricultural production (2000) Outlook on Agriculture, 29, pp. 25-30; Andrivon, D., Lucas, J.M., Ellisseche, D., Development of natural late blight epidemics in pure and mixed plots of potato cultivars with different levels of partial resistance (2003) Plant Pathology, 52, pp. 586-596; Bourke, P.M.A., Emergence of potato blight, 1843-46 (1964) Nature, 203, pp. 805-808; Burleigh, J.R., Loubane, M., Plot size effects on disease progress and yield of wheat infected by Mycosphaerella graminicola and barley infected by Pyrenophora teres (1984) Phytopathology, 74, pp. 545-549; Campbell, C.L., Madden, L.V., (1990) Introduction to Plant Disease Epidemiology, , New York: Wiley-Interscience; Connolly, T., McNicol, J.W., Wastie, R.L., Stewart, H.E., Evaluating between-plant interference in field trials for assessing potato genotypes for resistance to late blight (1995) Annals of Applied Biology, 127, pp. 273-282; Finckh, M.R., Wolfe, M.S., (1998) The Epidemiology of Plant Diseases: Diversification Strategies, pp. 231-259. , Ch. 11, Ed.

However, variation is restricted in breeding for uniform crop populations using the pedigree line approach. Pedigree lines are successful in agriculture because synthetic inputs are used to raise fertility and control weeds, pests and diseases. An alternative method promoted for exploring the value of variation and evolutionary fitness in crops is to create composite cross populations. Composite cross populations are formed by assembling seed stocks with diverse evolutionary origins, recombination of these stocks by hybridization, the bulking of F1 progeny, and subsequent natural selection for mass sorting of the progeny in successive natural cropping environments. Composite cross populations can provide dynamic gene pools, which in turn provide a means of conserving germplasm resources: they can also allow selection of heterogeneous crop varieties. The value of composite cross populations in achieving these aims is dependent on the outcome of mass trials by artificial and natural selection acting upon the heterogeneous mixture. There is evidence to suggest that composite cross populations may be an efficient way of providing heterogeneous crops and of selecting superior pure lines for low input systems characterized by unpredictable stress conditions. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",,"heritability; hybridization; natural selection; pest control; plant breeding",,,,,,"Alexander, H.M., Roelfs, A.P., Cobbs, G., Effects of disease and plant competition on yield in monocultures and mixtures of two wheat cultivars (1986) Plant Pathology, 35, pp. 457-465; Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1961) Crop Science, 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., The genetics of host-pathogen coevolution: Implications for genetic resource conservation (1990) The Journal of Heredity, 81, pp. 1-6; Allard, R.W., Hansche, P.E., Some parameters of population variability and their implications in plant breeding (1964) Advances in Agronomy, 16, pp. 281-325; Atlin, G.N., Frey, K.J., Predicting the relative effectiveness of direct versus indirect selection for oat yield in three types of stress environments (1989) Euphytica, 44, pp. 137-142; Austin, R.B., Bingham, J., Blackwell, R.D., Evans, L.T., Ford, M.A., Morgan, C.L., Taylor, M., Genetic improvements in winter wheat yields since 1900 and associated physiological changes (1980) Journal of Agricultural Science, Cambridge, 94, pp. 675-689; Baker, R.J., Briggs, K.G., Comparison of grain yield of uniblends and biblends of 10 spring barley cultivars (1984) Crop Science, 24, pp. 85-87; Barrett, J.A., Wolfe, M.S., Pathogen response to host resistance and its implications in breeding programmes (1980) European Mediterranean.

Farmers often plant mixtures of cassava cultivars, while bush-beans or maize are traditionally grown as cassava-intercrops. The objectives of this study were: (a) to determine if cassava or overall production can be improved by planting cassava cultivar mixtures or intercropping, (b) to assess the influence of soil properties on the dry matter production of cassava production systems, (c) to verify if soil cover can be increased by growing cultivar or species mixtures. On-farm trials were conducted at four locations in typical hillside environments with slopes up to 55% in the Southwest of Colombia from 1996 to 1998. Two cassava varieties contrasting in plant architecture (early branching variety, rich in apices versus erect, late branching variety, poor in apices) were grown as pure stands, as a variety mixture and each intercropped independently with upland rice or Canavalia brasiliensis. Rainfall during the trial period was only 76% of the long term average due to the 'El niño' phenomenon. The cassava cultivars produced tuber yields of 9.0 and 7.5 t ha -1 DM when planted in cultivar pure stands. Cassava growth and biomass production increased with increasing size of water stable aggregates and soil N content and decreased with increasing soil bulk density. In the cassava cultivar mixture, competition changed the pattern of biomass allocation, leading to a significantly lower harvest index compared to the mean of the pure stands (-6%). Intercropped C. brasiliensis significantly reduced cassava harvest index (-13%; mean of cassava/C. brasiliensis mixtures compared to mean of pure stands) as well as cassava (-53%) and total biomass production (-24%), while differences were not statistically significant in the cassava-rice systems probably because of the poor performance of rice. The strong reduction in cassava tuber yield in the cassava/C. brasiliensis systems was due to competition for water between cassava and the intercrop, aggravated by the lack of rain. The percentage of soil cover was slightly higher in all mixed cropping systems compared to the pure stands. In contrast to the mixture concept which seeks to increase productivity and soil cover compared to monocropping, the mixed cropping systems used in the studies in Rio Cabuyal reduced cassava tuber yield and total biomass production of the cropping systems compared to the cassava cultivar monocrops. When total soil cover was improved compared to the cassava cultivar pure stands it was paralleled by reductions in terms of cassava tuber yield. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

They are linked by common objectives of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. In many countries, organic farming now has a clear legislative basis and certification schemes for production and processing. A range of structural features and tactical management approaches are combined within whole farm systems. Organic livestock systems are land-based. Species-specific animal husbandry, housing, and nutrition interact with breed selection and stockmanship, and animal welfare standards are generally higher than comparable conventional systems. Production per animal is maintained or increased, but farm output may be reduced due to lower stocking rates. The design of a diverse crop rotation is the key to crop nutrition, weed, pest and disease control. In Europe, yeilds of arable crops are 60-80% of those in comparable conventional systems. In developing countries, organic farming practices increase crop yields with minimum external inputs. Lower variable costs and premium prices mean that organic farming systems are profitable. Energy consumption and pollution are generally reduced in organic farming systems. They have larger and more diverse flora, insect, and bird populations, caused by changes in both habitat structure and field management. The development of organic farming systems and markets illustrates that this is a valid alternative approach to intensification. With greater political will and investment in research, more of this potential could be realized. This should help not only to further oganic agriculture but also inform and improve the sustainability of other forms of agriculture. © 2001.",,,,,,,,,"Stockdale, E.A.; Soil Science Department IACR-Rothamsted Harpenden, Herts AL5 2JQ, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,00652113,0122000773; 9780122000775,,,"English","Adv.

Indeed, one of the most powerful ways both to reduce the risk of resistance break-down and to still make use of defeated resistance genes is to use cereal variety and species mixtures. The most important mechanisms reducing disease in variety and species mixtures are barrier and frequency effects, and induced resistance. Differential adaptation, i.e. adaptation within races to specific host genotypic backgrounds, may prevent the rapid evolution of complex pathotypes in mixtures. Mixtures generally stabilise yields and yield losses due to disease; abiotic stresses are also better buffered than in pure stands. When mixture components are carefully put together, product quality can be enhanced or at least equal that of the pure stands. Mixture use in practice worldwide is reviewed.","Differential adaptation; Evolutionary plant breeding; Functional diversity; Induced resistance; Yield stability","cereal grain; genetic improvement; mixture; pathotype; plant breeding; plant disease control; agricultural practice; disease control; disease resistance",,,,,,"Akanda, S.I., Mundt, C.C., Effects of two-component wheat cultivar mixtures on stripe rust severity (1996) Phytopathology, 86, pp. 347-353; Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1960) Crop Sci., 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., The genetics of host-pathogen coevolution: Implications for genetic resource conservation (1990) Heredity, 81, pp. 1-6; Allard, R.W., Adams, J., Population studies in predominantly self-pollinating species XIII Intergenotypic competition and population structure in barley and wheat (1969) Amer.

In the addition series, plant densities in pure stands of three cultivars, Rambo, Rodos and Grosso (susceptible, moderately resistant and immune, respectively) were varied six-fold. In the replacement series, the three possible two-way mixtures were analysed at different frequencies but at a density corresponding to the maximum pure stand density. Disease and yield were assessed off a per-plant basis. In the pure stands, tillering reduced the range of densities from six-fold to between three- and four-fold, while in the mixtures, frequencies changed only slightly over time, indicating that competitive interactions among the cultivars were roughly equal. Yield per plant decreased logarithmically with increasing density as expected. However, yield per seed head was not correlated with the final number of heads per plot, indicating low competition among heads even at the highest density. Disease in susceptible pure stands increased strongly with decreasing density in 1994 and to a lesser degree in 1995. These differences could have been caused by differences in plant nutritional status and consequent epidemiological effects. Disease reduction on the susceptible cultivars in mixtures varied between 33% and 71% among years. Depending on the length and strength of the epidemic, the effects of host density and frequency on disease severity varied substantially among years.","Barley; Cultivar mixtures; Density effects; Disease control; Frequency effects; Powdery mildew","barley; competition; cultivar; plant nutrition; plant pathology; planting density; powdery mildew; tillering; disease vector; fungal disease; survival",,,,,,"Akanda, S.I., Mundt, C.C., Effects of two-component cultivar mixtures and yellow rust on yield and yield components of wheat (1996) Phytopathology, 86, pp. 347-353; Allard, R.W., Relationship between genetic diversity and consistency of performance in different environments (1960) Crop Science, 1, pp. 127-133; Allard, R.W., Adams, J., Population studies in predominantly self-pollinating species XIII: Intergenotypic competition and population structure in barley and wheat (1969) American Naturalist, 103, pp. 620-645; Blijenburg, J.G., Sneep, J., Natural selection in a mixture of eight barley varieties grown in six successive years 1: Competition between the varieties (1975) Euphytica, 24, pp. 305-315; Browning, J.A., A unifying theory of the genetic protection of crop plant populations from diseases (1997) Disease Resistance from Crop Progenitors and Other Wild Relatives, , Wahl I, Fischbeck G, Browning JA, eds, Springer Verlag, in press; Burdon, J.J., Chilvers, G.A., Controlled environment experiments on epidemics of barley mildew in different density host stands (1976) Oecologia, 26, pp. 61-72; Burdon, J.J., Chilvers, G.A., Host density as a factor in disease ecology (1982) Annual Review of Plant Pathology, 20, pp. 143-166; Calonnec, A., Goyeau, H., De Vallavieille-Pope, C., Effects of induced resistance on infection efficiency and sporulation of Puccinia striiformis on seedlings in varietal mixtures and on field epidemics in pure stands (1996) European Journal of Plant Pathology, 102, pp. 733-741; Chin, K.M., Wolfe, M.S., Minchin, P.N., Host-mediated interactions between pathogen genotypes (1984) Plant Pathology, 33, pp. 161-171; Czembor, H.J., Gacek, E.S., The use of cultivar and species mixtures to control diseases and for yield improvement in cereals in Poland (1496) Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Integrated Control of Cereal Mildews Across Europe, November 5-10 1994, Kappel A.

The rest of the population was diverse. Diversity within common pathotypes, estimated by five RAPD and two SCAR markers, was generally high, except for one pathotype, which was frequent on Plaisant. This pathotype carried only one virulence, Va22, out of the 11 virulences tested.

One isolate, E1, was previously identified as being resistant to the triazole fungicide triadimenol, while the other, HL3/5, was sensitive. The 56 progeny tested were classified into two distinct groups, either being resistant to triadimenol, like E1, or sensitive, like HL3/5. The segregation ratio was not significantly different from 1:1, consistent with responses to triadimenol being controlled by a single gene. In further tests with cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, propiconazole and tebuconazole, all the progeny classified as resistant to triadimenol were also more resistant to each of these other triazole fungicides than were any of the triadimenol-sensitive progeny. This is consistent with the triadimenol resistance allele also conferring cross-resistance to the other triazoles. The ratio between the responses of the resistant and sensitive progeny (the resistance factor, RF) was greatest for triadimenol, followed by tebuconazole, propiconazole, epoxiconazole and cyproconazole, in that order. The RF for triadimenol was much greater when the fungicide was applied as a seed treatment than when it was sprayed. Five isolates, covering the five levels of responses to triadimenol identified previously in the UK population of E. graminis f.sp. hordei, were used as standards; a triadimenol-sensitive isolate and one with the lowest level of resistance were sensitive to all four of the other fungicides, while three isolates with higher levels of triadimenol-resistance were also more resistant to the other chemicals.",,"cyproconazole; disease control; epoxiconazole; fungicide resistance; genetic analysis; propiconazole; tebuconazole; triadimenol; triazole; Blumeria graminis; Erysiphe graminis",,,,,,"Atzema, J.L., Finckh, M.R., Wolfe, M.S., Genetics of the response of Erysiphe graminis f.sp. hordei to Mlo-resistance in barley (1996) Proceedings of the Ninth European and Mediterranean Cereal Rusts and Powdery Mildew Conference, pp. 55-57. , Kema GHJ, Niks RE, Daamen RA, eds.

Three different wheat cultivars were sampled three times to determine whether differences in host genotype correlated with differences among corresponding pathogen populations. Seven restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci and one DNA fingerprint were assayed for each of the 432 isolates in the collection. DNA fingerprints differentiated 426 unique genotypes. Though absolute differences were small, five RFLP loci exhibited significant differences in allele frequencies across the nine subpopulations. Gene diversity within all subpopulations was high (HT = 0.51), but only 3% of the total genetic variation was distributed among the nine subpopulations. When subpopulations were grouped according to geographical region or host cultivar, less than 1% of the genetic variation was distributed among groups, suggesting widespread gene flow and the absence of pathogen adaptation to specific wheat cultivars. Tests for gametic equilibrium within subpopulations and across the entire Swiss population supported the hypothesis of random mating.","Gametic disequilibrium; Genetic structure; Population genetics; Septoria nodorum; Stagonospora nodorum","Phaeosphaeria nodorum",,,,,,"Allingham, E.A., Jackson, L.F., Variation in pathogenicity, virulence, and aggressiveness of Septoria nodorum in Florida (1981) Phytopathology, 71, pp. 1080-1085; Bathgate, J.A., Loughman, R., Are ascospores a significant source of primary inoculum of Leptosphaeria nodorum, L. avenaria f. sp. avenaria and Mycosphaerella graminicola in the northern wheatbelt of Western Australia?

Data from seven nuclear RFLP loci were used to estimate gene diversity and genetic distances and to make indirect measures of gene flow between populations. Three of the seven RFLP loci differed significantly in allele frequencies across populations. On average, 96% of the total gene diversity was found within populations. There was little evidence for population subdivision, suggesting that gene flow was not restricted among populations. Based on an average population differentiation of 0.04, we estimated that the exchange of 11 migrants among populations per generation would be needed to account for the present level of population subdivision. Genotype diversity based on DNA fingerprints was at a maximum for the Swiss population, whereas populations in Texas and Oregon had lower genotype diversities. Many multilocus haplotypes were found in each population. Ninety-five percent of RFLP allele pairs were in gametic equilibrium. The data were consistent with random mating within each population.","population genetics; Septoria nodorum","Phaeosphaeria nodorum; Stagonospora nodorum",,,,,,"Allingham, E.A., Jackson, L.F., Variation in pathogenicity, virulence, and aggressiveness of Septoria nodorum in Florida (1981) Phytopathology, 71, pp. 1080-1085; Boeger, J.M., Chen, R.S., McDonald, B.A., Gene flow between geographic populations of Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici) detected with restriction fragment length polymorphism markers (1993) Phytopathology, 83, pp. 1148-1154; Brasier, C.M., Rapid changes in genetic structure of epidemic populations of Ophiostoma ulmi (1988) Nature (Lond.), 332, pp. 538-541; Brennan, R.M., Fitt, B.D.L., Taylor, G.S., Coulhoun, J., Dispersal of Septoria nodorum pycnidiospores by simulated rain and wind (1985) Phytopathol, Z., 112, pp. 291-297; Burdon, J.J., Marshall, D.R., Luig, N.H., Gow, D.J.S., Isozyme studies on the origin and evolution of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici in Australia (1982) Aust.

For this aim several established indices of diversity, and a novel one, were applied to population samples of the barley powdery mildew pathogen, Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei. Random spore samples were obtained from the air along transects through regions of interest across large parts of Europe in 1990. Significant geographical differences in diversity of virulence genotypes occurred among regional sub-samples. Diversity was highest in the samples from eastern Germany, Denmark and Austria, whereas the lowest values were found in the samples from Italy, southern France and parts of western Germany. Diversity in the pathogen population was generally related to the degree of diversification of host resistance in time and space, although there was considerable variation in ranking among different measures of diversity. Sensitivity to sample size proved to be the major problem with the use of several established indices of diversity. Working with very large sample sizes we used multiple random subsamples of various smaller sizes to determine how the mean index values changed with changing sample size. The Shannon index proved to be considerably affected by sample size, in contrast to the Simpson index that was therefore used us a global measure of diversity. Limits of confidence were estimated for the Simpson index using the bootstrap method of numerical resampling. The two aspects contributing to global diversity, richness and evenness, were considered separately to allow meaningful interpretation of the Simpson index. Random sub-sampling was used to reduce the influence of sample size differences for these measures. Dissimilarity, a novel measure of diversity for use in plant pathology, indicates the average number of major genes for host resistance against which pathotypes in a sample respond differently. It is thus able to account for the genetic relationship among pathotypes, which is not considered by any other index. The approaches developed in this study help to compare major forces driving evolution of large-scale populations of the barley mildew pathogen.","bootstrap method; dissimilarity; diversity indices; genetic distance; Shannon; Simpson","barley powdery mildew; diversity index; fungal pathogen; genetic diversity; sampling; Europe; Erysiphe graminis hordei",,,,,,"Andrivon, D., Limpert, E., Origin and proportions of the components of composite populations of Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei (1992) J Phytopathology, 135, pp. 6-19; Brändie, U., Schaffner, D., Wolfe, M.S., McDermott, J.M., DNA and virulence variation in a field population of Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei (1992) Vortr Pflanzenzüchtg, 24, pp. 37-38; Efron, B., Tibshirani, R., Statistical data analysis in the computer age (1991) Science, 253, pp. 390-395; Fisher, R.A., Corbet, A.S., Williams, C.B., The relation between the number of individuals and the number of species in a random sample of an animal population (1943) J Anim Ecol, 12, pp. 42-58; Fry, W.E., Goodwin, S.B., Matuszak, J.M., Spielman, L.J., Milgroom, M.G., Drenth, A., Population genetics and intercontinental migrations of Phythophthora infestons (1992) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 30, pp. 107-129; Groth, J.V., Roelfs, A.P., The concept and measurement of phenotypic diversity in Puccinia graminis on wheat (1987) Phytopathology, 77, pp. 1395-1399; Groth, J.V., Roelfs, A.P., Analysis of virulence diversity in populations of plant pathogens (1987) Populations of Plant Pathogens, pp. 63-74. , Wolfe MS and Caten CE (eds) Blackwell Scientific Publications; Groth, J.V., Roelfs, A.P., The analysis of genetic variation in populations of rust fungi (1989) Plant Disease Epidemiology.

Therefore, the main objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the stability of yield of a three-component wheat mixture with that of its components over a range of environments, and (2) to compare natural infection, by different diseases, of the mixture versus its components. The results provide strong evidence that the mixture behaved in a usefully predictable manner, at least as well as the means of the components, over a diverse range of environments in South Asia. The mixture was less variable over all environments compared with its components but was not necessarily more stable. The mixture restricted yellow and leaf rusts and foliar blight relative to the means of the components. No single method of stability analysis gave an unequivocal idea of stability. However, stochastic dominance analysis and the Westcott geometric method seemed most useful for indicating the genotypes that were least risky. Considering all environments, UP262 was the least stable genotype. Ska was less variable but had a lower mean yield. The mixture was relatively high yielding with the least variability. NL459 had the highest yield but was variable. Nevertheless, it emerged as stable in some analyses. From the point of view of safety over a large area of cultivation, the mixture would be preferable to NL459. © 1994.","Adaptation; Crop mixtures; G × E interaction; Multilines; Stability; Sustainability; Varietal mixtures","Triticum; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Anderson, Risk efficiency in the interpretation of agricultural production research (1974) Rev.

Subsamples were tested for their response to triadimenol fungicide and analyzed for 10 DNA loci using RAPD markers and PCR. There was a large range of haplotypes spread over Europe; irregularity in the distribution was probably due mainly to non-uniform use of the corresponding host resistances and fungicides. A large range of variation was also detectable within individual fields. Positive gametic disequilibria distorted the distribution of virulence alleles among haplotypes and reduced the number of haplotypes detectable in the sample. Analysis of the spread of the newly selected Val3 allele into different European sub-populations indicated that gene flow throughout the population may be rapid for alleles that have a selective advantage. Fungicide resistance was widespread in areas known for intensive use of fungicides for mildew control. Four classes of fungicide response were detectable and particular virulence haplotypes were found to be characteristic for each class. Variety mixtures used in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) reduced mildew infection, and thus fungicide use, during the years 1984-1991 despite the limited variation in host resistance among the mixtures. A tendency for complex pathogen races to increase in mixture crops was reversed by the large-scale re-introduction of fungicides for mildew control in 1991. The mixture strategy appeared to be more successful than using the same resistance alleles in pure monoculture or combining them in a single host genotype. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","barley mildew; DNA markers; Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei; fungicide resistance; Hordeum vulgare; population genetics; variety mixtures; virulence",,,,,,,"Andrivon, D., Limpert, E., Origin and proportions of components of populations of Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei.

The asexual progeny of each spore was tested for its response to a range of doses of a systemic triazole fungicide, triademenol. Principal components analysis of the data revealed that the majority of isolates had a distinct level of response to triadimenol, being resistant to triadimenol at the rate apoplied to seed commercially. The remaining isolates appeared either to be sensitive to the lowest dose of triadimenol used, or to have one of two intermediate levels of resistance. There was a significant increase in the frequency of isolates with higher levels of resistance to triadimenol during 1985. This is likely to have been a response to the continuing widespread use of demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides by British farmers. © 1991 Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.","barley powdery mildew; demethylation inhibitor; principal components analysis; triazole",,,,,,,"Andrivon, D., De Vallavieille-Pope, C., Barley powdery mildew in France (1987) Integrated control of cereal mildews: monitoring the pathogen, pp. 67-77. , M.S., Wolfe, E., Limpert, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht; Anonymous, 1986a.

Unfortunately, examination of natural systems makes it immediately clear that they are often complex and that the host-parasite interaction may be obscured by many other interactions with different organisms and with physical factors that all affect evolution. For example, though it may be generally true that parasites are deleterious to their hosts in natural systems, this may not always be the case. There is evidence that some parasites are directly beneficial to their hosts: others may be cryptically so. Furthermore, although processes such as density-dependent and frequency-dependent selection are considered to be important in host parasite co-evolution, there is little direct evidence for such effects. The role of gene-for-gene interactions and the effects of ""unnecessary"" virulence genes are also poorly understood. The principal reason for our lack of understanding of host-parasite co-evolution is that there have been no large-scale analyses of natural ecosystems that have been repeated at regular intervals to follow the dynamics of the host and parasite genotypes under selection. © 1988 Akademie-Verlag.",,,,,,,,"Augspurger, C.K., Kelly, C.K., Pathogen mortality of tropical tree seedlings: experimental studies of the effects of dispersal distance, seedling density, and light conditions (1984) Oecologia, 61, pp. 211-217. , Berlin; Barrett, J.A., Pathogen evolution in multilines and variety mixtures (1980) J.
