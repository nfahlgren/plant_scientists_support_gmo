There have been, however, few attempts to integrate pollen composition and floral landscape to test hypotheses about foraging behavior. Here, we present an individual-based model that generates the species composition of pollen loads given a foraging model and a spatial distribution of floral resources. We apply this model to an existing dataset of inflorescence counts and bumble bee pollen loads sampled at different field sites in California. For two out of three sites, a foraging model consisting in correlated random walks with constant preferences for each plant species provides a plausible fit for the observed distribution of pollen load content. Pollen load compositions at the third site could be explained by an extension of the model, where different preferences apply to the choice of an initial foraging patch and subsequent foraging steps. Since this model describes the expected level of pollen load differentiation due solely to the spatial clustering of conspecific plants, it provides a null hypothesis against which more complex descriptions of behavior (e.g. flower constancy) can be tested. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Approximate Bayesian computation; Bumble bee; Individual-based model; Pollination; Random walk","Bayesian networks; Ecology; Population distribution; Random processes; Approximate Bayesian; Bumble bee; Individual based model; Pollination; Random Walk; Plants (botany); bee; community composition; conspecific; data set; field method; floral trait; foraging behavior; hypothesis testing; individual-based model; landscape ecology; model test; palynology; pollen; preference behavior; random walk method; spatial distribution; California; United States; Apoidea; Bombus (genus)",,,,,,"Aronne, G., Giovanetti, M., Guarracino, M.R., de Micco, V., Foraging rules of flower selection applied by colonies of Apis mellifera: ranking and associations of floral sources (2012) Funct.

Nevertheless, unavoidable technical and instrumental requirements of PCR have limited its widespread application in field situations. The recent development of isothermal DNA amplification methods provides an alternative to PCR, which circumvents key limitations of PCR for direct amplification in the field. Being able to analyze DNA in the pollen cloud of an ecosystem would provide very useful ecological information, yet would require a field-enabled, high-throughput method for this potential to be realized. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of the loop-mediated DNA amplification method (LAMP), an isothermal DNA amplification technique, to be used in pollen analysis. We demonstrate that LAMP can provide a reliable method to identify species from the pollen cloud, and that it can amplify successfully with sensitivity down to single pollen grains, thus opening the possibility of field-based, high-throughput analysis. © 2014 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","DNA amplification; Field-diagnostics; Loop-mediated DNA amplification method; Pollen","DNA; chemistry; evaluation study; nucleic acid amplification; pollen; DNA; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pollen",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA",,,,"Abdul-Ghani, R., Al-Mekhlafi, A.M., Karanis, P., Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for malarial parasites of humans: Would it come to clinical reality as a point-of-care test (2012) Acta Trop, 122, pp. 233-240; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J Mol Biol, 215, pp. 403-410; Asiello, P.J., Baeumner, A.J., Miniaturized isothermal nucleic acid amplification: A review (2011) Lab Chip, 11, pp. 1420-1430; Brooks, J., Shaw, G., Sporopollenin: A review of its chemistry, palaeochemistry and geochemistry (1978) Grana, 17, pp. 91-97; Chen, P.H., Pan, Y.B., Chen, R.K., High-throughput procedure for single pollen grain collection and polymerase chain reaction in plants (2008) J Integr Plant Biol, 50, pp. 375-383; Curtis, K.A., Rudolph, D.L., Owen, S.M., Sequence-specific detection method for reverse transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification of HIV-1 (2009) J Med Virol, 81, pp. 966-972; D'Amato, G., Cecchi, L., Bonini, S., Nunes, C., Annesi-Maesano, I., Behrendt, H., Liccardi, G., Van Cauwenberge, P., Allergenic pollen and pollen allergy in Europe (2007) Allergy, 62, pp. 976-990; Han, E.T., Loop-mediated isothermal amplification test for the molecular diagnosis of malaria (2013) Expert Rev Mol Diagn, 13, pp. 205-218; Harris, E., (1998) A Low-Cost Approach to PCR.

Heterostylous plants are characterised by the presence of discrete morphs that differ in sex organ position and in some other ancillary traits. As regards sex organ deployment, different types of polymorphisms have been described, depending on number and type of discrete classes present in populations and degree of reciprocity between them. However, a clearcut characterisation of stylar polymorphisms does not appear to be the best approach when there is great variability among populations because of continuous variation of some of traits examined. A recent study in Lithodora sensu lato (recently split into two separate genera, Lithodora and Glandora) showed a wide variation in sex organ position across species in the genus, which warrants precise population analysis of stylar polymorphism and its reciprocity. We provide a detailed morphometric analysis of flower sexual traits and include those considered to be ancillary characters. We report a wide variation in these traits in populations of Lithodora s.l. and highlight the subjectivity of the former characterisation of style polymorphism based on visual inspection. Ancillary traits appear repeatedly in Lithodora and Glandora, particularly in the latter. The appearance of these traits seems to be related to greater reciprocity between sexual whorls in Glandora, with the exception of G. prostrata. These results agree with evolutionary steps proposed in the buildup of heterostyly according to some evolutionary models. We also examined variation in polymorphisms in light of current models for evolution of heterostyly, and, more specifically, we sought to verify the prediction that flower traits as a whole (i.e., flower integration) respond to selective pressure to assure the exact location of pollen on the pollinator body. Most reciprocal populations and species, where betweenmorph pollen transfer is expected to be higher, would show greater integration. Our results confirm this hypothesis. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Ancillary character; Disassortative mating; Distyly; Heterostyly; Phenotypic integration; Relaxed stylar dimorphism; Stylar polymorphism","dicotyledon; floral trait; hypothesis testing; life history trait; morphometry; polymorphism; reciprocity; sexual selection; article; biological model; Boraginaceae; evolution; flower; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genetics; histology; physiology; pollen; pollination; reproduction; Biological Evolution; Boraginaceae; Flowers; Genetic Variation; Models, Biological; Pollen; Pollination; Polymorphism, Genetic; Reproduction; Boraginaceae; Lithodora",,,,,,"Aigner, P.A., Optimality modeling and fitness tradeoffs: when should plants become pollinator specialists?

Despite their importance, the systematics of this species complex have remained elusive and little is known about their origin and biogeography. Using DNA analyses on a worldwide sample of matsutake, we present here the first comprehensive definition of natural groupings in this species complex. We infer patterns of migration and propose Eocene origins for the group in western North America by a transfer from an angiosperm-associated ancestor to an increasingly specialized conifer symbiont. From these origins, matsutake appear to have followed migratory routes parallel to those of coniferous hosts. Patterns of vicariance between eastern North America and eastern Asia are resolved and their origins are suggested to stem from migration through Beringia. Using an analysis of genetic dissimilarity and geographical distance, we reject both the possibility that migration into Europe and Asia occurred through Atlantic bridges and the connection between matsutake populations in the Mahgrebi Mountains and those from Europe. Instead, African and European matsutake appear to be the most recent ends of a westward expansion of the domain of these fungi from North America.","Basidiomycetes; Bering Strait; Biogeography; Disjunct distributions; Ectomycorrhiza; Pinus; Tricholoma; Vicariance","biogeography; ectomycorrhiza; evolution; phylogeography; Basidiomycota; Coniferophyta; Fungi; Magnoliophyta; Myxogastria; Tricholoma; Tricholoma matsutake",,,,,,"Abourouh, M., Najim, L., Les différents types d'ectomycorhizes naturelles de Cedrus atlantica Manetti au Maroc (1995) Cryptogamic Bot, 5, pp. 332-340; Amaranthus, M.P., Weigand, J.F., Abbott, R., Managing high-elevation forests to produce American matsutake (Tricholoma magnivelare), high-quality timber, and non-timber forest products (1998) West J Appl For, 13, pp. 120-128; Arora, D., (1986) Mushrooms Demystified, , Berkeley, California: Ten Speed Press; Avise, J.C., (1994) Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution, , New York: Chapman & Hall; Axelrod, D.I., Cenozoic history of some Western American pines (1986) Ann Miss Botan Garden, 73, pp. 565-641; Benton, M.J., Steins, nodes, crown clades, and rank-free lists: Is Linnaeus dead?

The importance of fungi to the movement of nitrogen (N) within soils and into plants highlights the need to consider such fractionations in the interpretation of ecosystem 15N distributions. • To separate the influence of physiological fractionations from N source preferences on fungal δ15N, both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and saprotrophic (SAP) fungi were grown in liquid culture containing (NH4)2HPO4 of known δ15N and harvested after 35 d. Time series experiments were employed for two taxa to determine how growth stage affects fractionation. • Mycelium δ15N was positively associated with several measures of growth and no distinction was observed between EM and SAP fungi. Kinetic isotope exchange models explain the decrease in discrimination against 15N at larger biomasses in terms of the amount of N utilized. The models indicate a fractionation of approx. -20‰, and suggest that assimilated N is excreted back into the medium during growth. • The observed fractionations at high and low N concentrations provide insight into the mechanisms that could drive fungal, plant and soil δ15N. We suggest that detailed information on fungal life histories, territorial behaviours, and sink-source relationships in the fungus-plant-soil continuum could aid accurate ecological interpretations of δ15N. © New Phytologist (2004).","δ15N; Ammonium assimilation; Ectomycorrhizal; Nitrogen; Nitrogen recycling; Saprotrophic","fungus; Basidiomycota; Fungi",,,,,,"Cooke, R., Rayner, A., (1984) Ecology of Saprotrophic Fungi, , New York, USA: Longman; Criss, R.E., (1999) Principles of Stable Isotope Distribution, , New York, USA: Oxford University Press; Emmerton, K.S., Callaghan, T.V., Jones, H.E., Leake, J.R., Michelsen, A., Read, D.J., Assimilation and isotopic fractionation of nitrogen by mycorrhizal fungi (2001) New Phytologist, 151, pp. 503-511; Evans, R.D., Physiological mechanisms influencing plant nitrogen isotope composition (2001) Trends in Plant Science, 6, pp. 121-126; Fogel, M.L., Cifuentes, L.A., Isotope Fractionation during Primary Production (1993) Organic Geochemistry Principles and Applications, pp. 73-98. , Engel MH, Macko SA, eds.

It is distinguished from other genera in the family Rhytismataceae by its filiform ascospores and ascocarps that open by a longitudinal slit. Nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA were used to infer phylogenetic relationships within Lophodermium. Twenty-nine sequences from approximately 11 species of Lophodermium were analyzed together with eight sequences from isolates thought to represent six other genera of Rhytismataceae: Elytroderma, Lirula, Meloderma, Terriera, Tryblidiopsis and Colpoma. Two putative Meloderma desmazieresii isolates occurred within the Lophodermium clade but separate from one another, one grouped with L. indianum and the other with L. nitens. An isolate of Elytroderma deformans also occurred within the Lophodermium clade but on a solitary branch. The occurrence of these genera within the Lophodermium clade might be due to problems in generic concepts in Rhytismataceae, such as emphasis on spore morphology to delimit genera, to difficulty of isolating Rhytismataceae needle pathogens from material that also is colonized by Lophodermium or to a combination of both factors. We also evaluated the congruence of host distribution and several morphological characters on the ITS phylogeny. Lophodermium species from pine hosts formed a monophyletic sister group to Lophodermium species from more distant hosts from the southern hemisphere, but not to L. piceae from Picea. The ITS topology indicated that Lophodermium does not show strict co-speciation with pines at deeper branches, although several closely related isolates have closely related hosts. Pathogenic species occupy derived positions in the pine clade, suggesting that pathogenicity has evolved from endophytism. A new combination is proposed, Terriera minor (Tehon) P.R.

Generally, δ13C values of the fungal biomass were (i) enriched in 13C relative to the growth medium, (ii) variable among the isolates, and (iii) dependent on the growth rate and growth stage of the fungi. We found a multiphasic dynamic of fractionation for Cryptoporus volvatus and Marasmius androsaceus during various growth stages. The first phase, P1, corresponded to the exponential growth stage and was characterized by an increasing enrichment in 13C content of the fungal biomass relative to the growth medium ranging between 4.6 and 6.9‰. The second phase, P2, exhibited a continual depletion in 13C of the fungal biomass, with the δ13C values of the fungal biomass asymptotically returning to the δ13C value of the growth medium at inoculation. The expression of the various fractionation phases was dependent on the amount of low-concentration micronutrients and growth factors added to the growth medium. The onset of P2 occurred at reduced concentrations of these elements. All of the sugars in the growth medium (sucrose, maltose, and glucose) were utilized for growth, indicating that the observed fractionation was not an artifact derived from the preferential use of 13C-rich maltose, which was found at low concentrations in the growth medium. In this study, we establish a framework with which to explore the impact of physiological fractionations by fungal interfaces on natural distributions of stable C isotopes.",,"Biomass; Carbon; Fractionation; Fungi; Growth kinetics; Isotopes; Physiology; Physiological process; Microbiology; carbon; isotope; isotopic fractionation; animal cell; article; Basidiomycetes; biomass; ecosystem; fractionation; fungus culture; fungus growth; molecular dynamics; mycelium; nonhuman; protein content; protein expression; sporocarp; Basidiomycota; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon Isotopes; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Animalia; Basidiomycota; Cryptoporus volvatus; Fungi; Marasmius; Marasmius androsaceus",,"Carbon Isotopes; Environmental Pollutants",,,,"Benito, B., Lagunas, R., The low-affinity component of Saccharomyces cerevisiae maltose transport is an artifact (1992) J.

Direct effects on non-target species, and the possibility of unintentionally transferring traits of ecological relevance onto landraces and wild relatives have also been sources of concern. The degree of genetic connectivity between industrial crops and their progenitors in landraces and wild relatives is a principal determinant of the evolutionary history of crops and agroecosystems throughout the world. Recent introductions of transgenic DNA constructs into agricultural fields provide unique markers to measure such connectivity. For these reasons, the detection of transgenic DNA in crop landraces is of critical importance.

Millions of hectares worldwide will be subjected to conversion into plantations during the next decades. However, pine introductions are known to result in a marked depletion of soil C, a phenomenon which has remained unexplained. We studied plantations in paramo grasslands of Ecuador, where the effect of the exotic introduction of radiata pines (Pinus radiata) and their accompanying ectomycorrhizal fungi can be studied in isolation from other ecosystem disturbances. We suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungi can extract C previously accumulated by paramo grasslands based on (a) a drastic simplification of the ectomycorrhizal community shown by direct DNA identification, (b) a loss of up to 30% soil C within &lt;20 years of plantation, (c) stable C isotope values in fungal fruitbodies which are closer to grassland than pine values, and (d) radiocarbon dating of fruitbodies indicating relatively old C sources for fruitbody formation. Species number in the ectomycorrhizal guild drops to only three fungal species per plantation compared to approximately 100 in comparable native pine stands. Our results provide evidence for a dynamic role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil C processing, and question the strategy of introducing pine plantations as a general solution to reduce mounting atmospheric CO2 levels. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Basidiomycete fungal biomass was consistently enriched for the heavier isotope for C relative to substrate and either enriched or depleted for N relative to atmospheric N. Extent and pattern of fractionation was very variable, but the distinction between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes was strongly supported, particularly when dual isotope analyses were performed. This differentiation, which we call the ""EM-SAP Divide"" holds for studies within a restricted ecosystem, but becomes less distinct over larger geographical regions, removing the rationale for using direct isotopic values from single specimens as diagnostic of ecophysiological role. For C, the EM-SAP Divide seems to reflect substrate effects, potentially due to differential access to recently synthesized versus recycled organic compounds, rather than distinct physiological pathways. Once substrate and ecophysiological role effects are removed, our meta-analysis suggests the existence of more than one mechanism causing C fractionations in fungi which is found equally in ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. Similarly, a multimodal distribution of δ15N values suggests that physiological effects may play a much stronger influence on N natural isotopic distributions in fungi. Our meta-analysis provides a firm statistical base to evaluate fungal ecological statements based on natural isotopic distributions of C and N. We call into question the current practice of using direct isotopic measurements to make statements about trophic relationships of fungi in the absence of other supporting evidence.","Carbon isotope ratio; Mycorrhizal fungi; Nitrogen isotope ratio; Saprotrophic fungi; Stable isotopic fractionation","biotransformation; carbon; ecophysiology; ectomycorrhiza; fractionation; fungus; nitrogen; saprotrophy; Basidiomycota; Fungi; Mycorrhizae",,,,,,"Abraham, W.-R., Hesse, C., Pelz, O., Ratios of carbon isotopes in microbial lipids as an indicator of substrate usage (1998) Appl Environ Microbiol, 64, pp. 4202-4209; Bashkin, M.A., Binkley, D., Changes in soil carbon following afforestation in Hawaii (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 828-833; Bernoux, M., Cerri, C.C., Neill, C., De Moraes, J.F.L., The use of stable carbon isotopes for estimating soil organic matter turnover rates (1998) Geoderma, 82, pp. 43-58; Blair, N., Leu, A., Munoz, E., Olsen, J., Kwong, E., Des Marais, D., Carbon isotopic fractionation in heterotrophic microbial metabolism (1985) Appl Environ Microbiol, 50, pp. 996-1001; Chapela, I.H., Osher, L.J., Horton, T.R., Henn, M.R., Mycorrhizal fungi associated with exotic pine plantations induce soil carbon depletion (2001) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, , in press; Frey, S.D., Elliott, E.T., Paustian, K., Bacterial and fungal abundance and biomass in conventional and no-tillage agroecosystems along two climatic gradients (1999) Soil Biol Biochem, 31, pp. 573-585; Gardes, M., Bruns, T., ITS-RFLP matching for identification of fungi (1996), pp. 177-186. , Clapp JP (ed) Methods in molecular iology, vol 50, Species diagnostics protocols: PCR and other nucleic acid methods.

Little is known about isotopic effects of many such components, especially microbes. Here we report on the discovery of an unexpected pattern of C isotopic discrimination by basidiomycete fungi with far-reaching consequences for our understanding of isotopic processing in ecosystems where these microbes mediate material transfers across trophic levels. We measured fractionation effects on three ecologically relevant basidiomycete species under controlled laboratory conditions. Sucrose derived from C3 and C4 plants is fractionated differentially by these microbes in a taxon-specific manner. The differentiation between mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi observed in the field by others is not explained by intrinsic discrimination patterns. Fractionation occurs during sugar uptake and is sensitive to the nonrandom distribution of stable isotopes in the sucrose molecule. The balance between respiratory physiology and fermentative physiology modulates the degree of fractionation. These discoveries disprove the assumption that fungal C processing does not significantly alter the distribution of stable C isotopes and provide the basis for a reevaluation of ecosystem models based on isotopic evidence that involve C transfer across microbial interfaces. We provide a mechanism to account for the observed differential discrimination effects.",,"carbon; isotope; sucrose; carbon flux; decomposition; fractionation; fungus; isotopic analysis; sugar; article; Basidiomycetes; controlled study; decomposition; ecosystem; energy resource; fermentation; fractionation; fungus; mycorrhiza; nonhuman; plant; species difference; sugar transport; Carbon Isotopes; Carboxylic Acids; Ecosystem; Fungi; Oxygen Consumption; Spores, Fungal; Sucrose; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; sucrose, 122880-25-5, 57-50-1; Carbon Isotopes; Carboxylic Acids; Sucrose, 57-50-1",,,,"Abraham, W.-R., Hesse, C., Pelz, O., Ratios of carbon isotopes in microbial lipids as an indicator of substrate usage (1998) Appl.

Such endophytes, which often do not damage their host, provide useful models to study mutualistic and pathogenic fungus-plant symbioses. In the Xylariaceae a family of mostly endophytic fungi, ascospores are irreversibly activated, prior to germination, within minutes of contact with a potential host. This activation was studied to establish the biochemical nature and specificity of recognition between these fungi and various host plants. Ascospores of different xylariaceous species can recognize different plant species. The biochemical signature responsible for this recognition is provided by mixtures of monolignols, including the glycosides Z-isoconiferin and Z-syringin, released to the plant surface from small wounds in the bark. Dose-response curves for ascospore activation by crude extracts and by the purified monolignols demonstrate that these compounds can act as high-affinity messengers, and that spores can distinguish structurally similar monolignols, leading us to postulate the existence of specific receptors for these molecules in fungal spores. © 1991.",,,,,,,,"Carroll, Fungal endophytes in stems and leaves: from latent pathogen to mutualistic symbiont (1988) Ecology, 69, pp. 2-9; Chapela, Boddy, Fungal colonization of attached beech branches.

There was considerable within and between branch variation in decay rate and water content. Water content at the time of sampling was not directly correlated with percentage weight loss or instantaneous decay rate, nor was it correlated with position in the log. However, wood occupied by Ascomycotina (other than Nectria) tended to be drier than that occupied by Basidiomycotina. In particular wood occupied by Xylaria hypoxylon was drier than that occupied by all other species, although wood in which X. hypoxylon was replacing other fungi was wetter than when X. hypoxylon was alone. Variation in percentage weight loss could not be explained in terms of water content and fungal species composition at the time of sampling, but variation in instantaneous decay rate could. Thus, decay rate by Ascomycotina was significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) than by Basidiomycotina, and rate of CO2 evolution from wood occupied by X. hypoxylon alone was significantly slower than from wood in which X. hypoxylon was replacing H. fragiforme or Nectria.

Overall colonization rate was similar on most sites. On two sites which were studied in more detail, colonization data were partitioned between species which are latently present and those which are not. Fungi which were present latently developed rapidly and then began to decline after 32 to 64 weeks, whereas other colonizers developed more slowly and did not decline during the experiment. Cumulative species number data indicated a continuous recruitment of species for at least 70 weeks. Floristic composition of branches on all time sites was generally similar, although some species were found on only one or a few sites and then usually their frequency and abundance were low. Differences were detected in decay rate at different sites, which were presumably attributable to both site factors and decay organisms. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in decay rate were detected between branches which were and those which were not colonized by basidiomycetes. © 1988.","Colonization dynamics; Community development; Hypoxylon spp.; Latent invasion; Wood decay",,,,,,,"Rayner, Todd, Population and community structure and dynamics of fungi in decaying wood (1979) Adv.
