Due to the large volumes of API used in hospitals, an increasing attention has been recently paid to their effluents as a source of environmental pollution. Based on the consumption data of a Swiss university hospital, about hundred of API has been prioritized following an OPBT approach (Occurrence, Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity). In addition, an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) allowed prioritizing API based on predicted concentrations and environmental toxicity data found in the literature for 71 compounds. Both prioritization approaches were compared. OPBT prioritization results highlight the high concern of some non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiviral drugs, whereas antibiotics are revealed by ERA as potentially problematic to the aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, according to the predicted risk quotient, only the hospital fraction of ciprofloxacin represents a risk to the aquatic organisms. Some compounds were highlighted as high-priority with both methods: ibuprofen, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ritonavir, gabapentin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, raltegravir, propofol, etc. Analyzing consumption data and building prioritization lists helped choosing about 15 API to be monitored in hospital wastewaters. The API ranking approach adopted in this study can be easily transposed to any other hospitals, which have the will to look at the contamination of their effluents. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental risk assessment; Hospital effluents; Pharmaceuticals; Predicted environmental concentrations; Prioritization","analgesic agent; anesthetic agent; antibiotic agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antiinflammatory agent; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; cardiovascular agent; laxative; macrogol; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; aquatic ecosystem; comparative study; concentration (composition); drug; effluent; environmental assessment; environmental risk; hospital sector; human activity; pollution control; prioritization; active pharmaceutical ingredient effluent; antimicrobial activity; aquatic environment; aquatic species; Article; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; effluent; environmental monitoring; fluid intake; hospital waste; methodology; nonhuman; pollution; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; toxicity; waste water; waste water management; water cycle; Switzerland",,"macrogol, 25322-68-3",,,,"Al Aukidy, M., Verlicchi, P., Voulvoulis, N., A framework for the assessment of the environmental risk posed by pharmaceuticals originating from hospital effluents (2014) Sci.

The study focused on the role of DOM in the transport of these micropollutants from parcels to surface waters (river, lake). Soil solution and river water samples were collected in the Lavaux vineyard area, western Switzerland. Their fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEM) were decomposed using parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and compared to their content in glyphosate and copper. PARAFAC analysis of EEM of both types of samples showed the contribution of protein-like and humic-like fluorophores. In soil water samples, complexes between fulvic-like and humic-like fluorophores of DOM, copper, and glyphosate were likely formed. In surface water, DOM-copper and glyphosate-copper interactions were observed, but not between glyphosate and DOM. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Copper; Dissolved organic matter; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Glyphosate; Parallel factor analysis","agrochemical; copper; dissolved organic matter; fluorescence spectroscopy; fungicide; glyphosate; lake pollution; organic compound; pollutant transport; river pollution; river water; soil pollution; soil water; surface water; vineyard; Switzerland; copper; glycine; glyphosate; soil; water pollutant; analogs and derivatives; chemistry; drug effects; factorial analysis; physiology; procedures; river; soil; spectrofluorometry; Switzerland; Vitis; water pollutant; Copper; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Glycine; Rivers; Soil; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Switzerland; Vitis; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; glyphosate, 1071-83-6; Copper; Glycine; glyphosate; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"Alvarez-Puebla, R.A., Garrido, J.J., Effect of pH on the aggregation of a gray humic acid in colloidal and solid states (2005) Chemosphere, 59 (5), pp. 659-667. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXisFGlurw%3D; Aoustin, E., Schäfer, A.I., Fane, A.G., Waite, T.D., Ultrafiltration of natural organic matter (2001) Sep Purif Technol, 22-23, pp. 63-78; Barja, B.C., dos Santos Afonso, M., An ATR-FTIR study of glyphosate and its Fe(III) complex in aqueous solution (1998) Environ Sci Technol, 32 (21), pp. 3331-3335. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK1cXlvVOjt7o%3D; Barrett, K.A., McBride, M.B., Trace element mobilization in soils by glyphosate (2006) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 70 (6), pp. 1882-1888. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28Xht1aks7vM; Borggaard, O.K., Gimsing, A.L., Fate of glyphosate in soil and the possibility of leaching to ground and surface waters: a review (2008) Pest Manage Sci, 64 (4), pp. 441-456. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXksVGqur0%3D; Bro, R., PARAFAC.

Three organic amendments, compost, sewage sludge and horse manure, used by urban market gardeners in Dakar, Senegal were analyzed for their OM maturity. Their fate was evaluated in a 45-d agronomic trial in a sandy Arenosol with lettuce. In each case, water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) and humic-like substances (HLS) were isolated from raw amendments and amended soils, and characterized using ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy. Results highlighted the general more aromatic character of HLS and WEOM fractions extracted from compost compared to the other two amendments. When applied to soils, however, these differences were not clearly observed. The aromaticity and humification degree of the labile fraction (WEOM) increased with depth in the first 30 cm for all amendments. This indicated the high lixiviation rates that fresh OM underwent in the studied sandy soil. Finally, a statistical analysis of the results was able to discriminate between surface and deeper horizons and between amended- and non-amended soil samples. Spectroscopic indices showed indeed strong increase/decrease with depth linked with the mineralization/humification processes that the fresh OM from amendments underwent during the 45 d of the agronomic trial. This study highlights the potential of spectroscopic techniques to study agricultural amendment organic matter fractions and their fate in soils. © 2015 Soil Science Society of China.","Absorbance spectroscopy; Compost; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Horse manure; Humic-like substances; Sewage sludge; Water-extractable organic matter","agronomy; dune field; humification; soil amendment; soil depth; soil fertility; soil organic matter; urban site; Dakar [Senegal]; Senegal; Equidae; Lactuca",,,,,,"Baker, A., Inverarity, R., Protein-like fluorescence intensity as a possible tool for determining river water quality (2004) Hydrol.

In the present study, a typical vineyard river of western Switzerland was first monitored to measure discharged loads, identify sources, and assess the dynamic of the herbicide glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). Second, based on river concentrations, an associated environmental risk was calculated using laboratory tests and ecotoxicity data from the literature. Measured concentrations confirmed the mobility of these molecules with elevated peaks during flood events, up to 4970 ng/L. From April 2011 to September 2011, a total load of 7.1 kg was calculated, with 85% coming from vineyards and minor urban sources and 15% from arable crops. Compared with the existing literature, this load represents an important fraction (6-12%) of the estimated amount applied because of the steep vineyard slopes (∼10%). The associated risk of these compounds toward aquatic species was found to be negligible in the present study, as well as for other rivers in Switzerland. A growth stimulation was nevertheless observed for the algae Scenedesmus vacuolatus with low concentrations of glyphosate, which could indicate a risk of perturbation in aquatic ecosystems, such as eutrophication. The combination of field and ecotoxicity data allowed the performance of a realistic risk assessment for glyphosate and AMPA, which should be applied to other pesticide molecules. © 2013 SETAC.","Aminomethylphosphonic acid; Glyphosate; Risk assessment; Species sensitivity distribution; Vineyard river","Amino-methylphosphonic acids; Aminomethylphosphonic acid; Environmental problems; Environmental risk assessment; Glyphosates; Herbicide glyphosate; Scenedesmus vacuolatus; Species sensitivity distributions; Catchments; Eutrophication; Floods; Metabolites; Molecules; Risk assessment; River pollution; Rivers; Weed control; Herbicides; alpha amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid; glyphosate; surface water; alga; catchment; data acquisition; environmental impact assessment; environmental risk; eutrophication; glyphosate; metabolism; metabolite; mobility; perturbation; river; surface water; toxicity; vineyard; water pollution; algal growth; aquatic environment; aquatic species; article; biodegradation; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); ecotoxicity; electric conductivity; gardening; growth stimulation; lake; nonhuman; pH; precipitation; priority journal; residential area; risk assessment; risk factor; rural area; Switzerland; urban area; vineyard; weed control; Aminomethylphosphonic acid; Glyphosate; Risk assessment; Species sensitivity distribution; Vineyard river; Aquatic Organisms; Floods; Glycine; Herbicides; Organophosphonates; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Switzerland; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Lake Geneva; Switzerland; algae; Scenedesmus vacuolatus",,"alpha amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid, 77521-29-0; glyphosate, 1071-83-6; Glycine, TE7660XO1C; Herbicides; Organophosphonates; Water Pollutants, Chemical; aminomethylphosphonic acid; glyphosate, 1071-83-6",,,"PDFMP2-123021/2, SNSF, Swiss National Science Foundation; FNS200021-135241, SNSF, Swiss National Science Foundation","Freitas, L.G., Singer, H., Müller, S.R., Schwarzenbach, R.P., Stamm, C., Source area effects on herbicide losses to surface waters-A case study in the Swiss Plateau (2008) Agric Ecosys Environ, 128, pp. 177-184; Brown, C.D., van Beinum, W., Pesticide transport via sub-surface drains in Europe (2009) Environ Pollut, 157, pp. 3314-3324; Rabiet, M., Margoum, C., Gouy, V., Carluer, N., Coquery, M., Assessing pesticide concentrations and fluxes in the stream of a small vineyard catchment-Effect of sampling frequency (2010) Environ Pollut, 158, pp. 737-748; Salmon-Monviola, J., Gascuel-Odoux, C., Garcia, F., Tortrat, F., Cordier, M.-O., Masson, V., Trépos, R., Simulating the effect of technical and environmental constraints on the spatio-temporal distribution of herbicide applications and stream losses (2011) Agric Ecosys Environ, 140, pp. 382-394; Battaglin, W.A., Rice, K.C., Focazio, M.J., Salmons, S., Barry, R.X., The occurrence of glyphosate, atrazine, and other pesticides in vernal pools and adjacent streams in Washington, DC, Maryland, Iowa, and Wyoming, 2005-2006 (2009) Environ Monit Assess, 155, pp. 281-307; Hanke, I., Singer, H., Hollender, J., Ultratrace-level determination of glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid and glufosinate in natural waters by solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: Performance tuning of derivatization, enrichment and detection (2008) Anal Bioanal Chem, 391, pp. 2265-2276; Delabays, N., Bohren, C., Le glyphosate: Bilan de la situation mondiale et analyse de quelques conséquences malherbologiques pour la Suisse (2007) Rev Suisse Vitic Arboric Hortic, 39, pp. 333-339; Dill, G.M., Sammons, R.D., Feng, P.C.C., Kohn, F., Kretzmer, K., Mehrsheikh, A., Bleeke, M., Haupfear, E.A., Glyphosate: Discovery, development, applications, and properties (2010) Glyphosate Resistance in Crops and Weeds, pp. 1-33. , In Nandula VK, ed, John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ, USA; Klein, A., Manco, F., Charles, R., (2007), Agricultural pesticides in the Swiss catchment area of Lake Geneva.

Their derivatization with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) was done prior to their concentration and purification by solid phase extraction. The concentrated derivates were then analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Spiking tests at three different concentrations were realized in several water matrices: ultrapure water, Evian© mineral water, river water, soil solution and runoff water of a vineyard. Except for AMPA in runoff water, obtained regression curves for all matrices of interest showed no statistical differences of their slopes and intercepts, validating the method for the matrix effect correction in relevant environmental samples. The limits of detection and quantification of the method were as low as 5 and 10 ng/l respectively for the three compounds. Spiked Evian© and river water samples at two different concentrations (30 and 130 ng/l) showed mean recoveries between 86 and 109%, and between 90 and 133% respectively. Calibration curves established in spiked Evian© water samples between 10 and 1000 ng/l showed r2 values above 0.989. Monitoring of a typical vineyard river showed peaks of pollution by glyphosate and AMPA during main rain events, sometimes above the legal threshold of 100 ng/l, suggesting the diffuse export of these compounds by surface runoff. The depth profile sampled in the adjacent lake near a waste water treatment plant outlet showed a concentration peak of AMPA at 25m depth, indicating its release with treated urban wastewater. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","AMPA; glufosinate; glyphosate; liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; surface water","9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate; Aminomethylphosphonic acid; AMPA; Glufosinate; Glyphosates; Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometries; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Statistical differences; Beverages; Herbicides; Lakes; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Rivers; Runoff; Soil moisture; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Weed control; River pollution; aminomethylphosphonic acid; drug derivative; glycine; glyphosate; herbicide; phosphonic acid derivative; concentration (composition); glyphosate; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolite; monitoring; organic acid; runoff; vine; wastewater; water treatment; article; chemistry; environmental monitoring; liquid chromatography; methodology; river; Switzerland; tandem mass spectrometry; validation study; water pollutant; Chromatography, Liquid; Environmental Monitoring; Glycine; Herbicides; Organophosphonates; Rivers; Switzerland; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Switzerland",,"aminomethylphosphonic acid, 1066-51-9; glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; glyphosate, 1071-83-6; Glycine, 56-40-6; Herbicides; Organophosphonates; Water Pollutants, Chemical; aminomethylphosphonic acid; glyphosate, 1071-83-6",,,,"Delabays, N., Bohren, C., Le glyphosate: bilan de la situation mondiale et analyse de quelques conséquences malherbologiques pour la Suisse (2007) Revue suisse Vitic.

They were equipped at their bottom with porous ceramic cups and runoff collectors, which allowed retrieving water samples for the growing seasons 2010 and 2011. The role of slope, soil properties and rainfall regime in their export was examined and the surface runoff/throughflows ratio was determined with a mass balance. Our results revealed elevated glyphosate and AMPA concentrations at 60 and 80 cm depth at parcel bottoms, suggesting their infiltration in the upper parts of the parcels and the presence of preferential flows in the studied parcels. Indeed, the succession of rainy days induced the gradual saturation of the soil porosity, leading to rapid infiltration through macropores, as well as surface runoff formation. Furthermore, the presence of more impervious weathered marls at 100 cm depth induced throughflows, the importance of which in the lateral transport of the herbicide molecules was determined by the slope steepness. Mobility of glyphosate and AMPA into the unsaturated zone was thus likely driven by precipitation regime and soil characteristics, such as slope, porosity structure and layer permeability discrepancy. Important rainfall events (>10 mm/day) were clearly exporting molecules from the soil top layer, as indicated by important concentrations in runoff samples. The mass balance showed that total loss (10-20%) mainly occurred through surface runoff (96%) and, to a minor extent, by throughflows in soils (4%), with subsequent exfiltration to surface waters. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","AMPA; Glyphosate; infiltration; runoff; Switzerland; throughflows; vineyards","AMPA; Glyphosates; Switzerland; throughflows; vineyards; Fertilizers; Infiltration; Metabolites; Molecules; Rain; Runoff; Soils; Weed control; Herbicides; aminomethylphosphonic acid; drug derivative; glycine; glyphosate; herbicide; phosphonic acid derivative; glyphosate; growing season; infiltration; metabolite; molecular analysis; organic acid; permeability; pollution effect; precipitation (chemistry); runoff; saturation; soil pollution; soil property; surface water; throughflow; vine; article; chemistry; environmental monitoring; kinetics; soil; soil pollutant; Switzerland; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Glycine; Herbicides; Kinetics; Organophosphonates; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Switzerland; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Switzerland",,"aminomethylphosphonic acid, 1066-51-9; glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; glyphosate, 1071-83-6; Glycine, 56-40-6; Herbicides; Organophosphonates; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants, Chemical; aminomethylphosphonic acid; glyphosate, 1071-83-6",,,,"Stangroom, S.J., Collins, C.D., Lester, J.N., Abiotic behaviour of organic micropollutants in soils and the aquatic environment.
