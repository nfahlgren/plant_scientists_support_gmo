Research Institute, Wichita, KS, United States","Objectives: To evaluate possible changes in USDA nutrient content data for 43 garden crops between 1950 and 1999 and consider their potential causes. Methods: We compare USDA nutrient content data published in 1950 and 1999 for 13 nutrients and water in 43 garden crops, mostly vegetables. After adjusting for differences in moisture content, we calculate ratios of nutrient contents, R (1999/1950), for each food and nutrient. To evaluate the foods as a group, we calculate median and geometric mean R-values for the 13 nutrients and water. To evaluate R-values for individual foods and nutrients, with hypothetical confidence intervals, we use USDA's standard errors (SEs) of the 1999 values, from which we generate 2 estimates for the SEs of the 1950 values. Results: As a group, the 43 foods show apparent, statistically reliable declines (R < 1) for 6 nutrients (protein, Ca, P, Fe, riboflavin and ascorbic acid), but no statistically reliable changes for 7 other nutrients. Declines in the medians range from 6% for protein to 38% for riboflavin. When evaluated for individual foods and nutrients, R-values are usually not distinguishable from 1 with current data. Depending on whether we use low or high estimates of the 1950 SEs, respectively 33% or 20% of the apparent R-values differ reliably from 1. Significantly, about 28% of these R-values exceed 1. Conclusions: We suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between 1950 and 1999, in which there may be trade-offs between yield and nutrient content.","Agriculture; Food analysis; History; Nutritive value","ascorbic acid; calcium; iron; phosphorus; protein; riboflavin; agriculture; article; calculation; comparative study; confidence interval; crop; food analysis; food composition; government; history; nutrient content; nutritional value; vegetable; water content; Crops, Agricultural; Databases, Factual; Food Analysis; Humans; Minerals; Nutritive Value; United States; United States Department of Agriculture; Vegetables; Vitamins",,"ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; calcium, 7440-70-2; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; protein, 67254-75-5; riboflavin, 83-88-5; Minerals; Vitamins",,,,"Mayer, A.M., Historical changes in the mineral content of fruits and vegetables (1997) Br Food J, 99, pp. 207-211; Jack, A., Nutrition under siege (1998) One Peaceful World (Kushi Institute Newsletter), p. 1. , Becket, MA, Spring; Long, C., Is chemical farming making our food less nutritious?

All whole foods contain a large majority of these nutrients in significant amounts relative to their energy content, and a varied diet of whole foods probably would deserve the widely held complacent beliefs about the status of nutrition in the United States. Unfortunately, it is seldom realized that most Americans derive a majority of their calories from dismembered foods which have lost all or most of the nutrients in whole foods. As a result, most Americans receive intakes of many nutrients which are less than recommended, and there is much room for improvement of nutrition in the United States. Our most fundamental and accepted goal should be to reduce consumption of dismembered food such as purified sugars, separated fats, alcohol and milled grains. We need to refocus nutrition education on the benefits of whole foods and on the sometimes little-known pitfalls of dismembered foods.",,"human; nutrition; prevention; therapy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00218960,,JNAPA,,"English","J.

The supplement contained 8 minerals in moderate amounts and 11 vitamins, mostly in relative large amounts. During the first 4-month period (double-blind) the 5 children who received supplements increased their average IQ by 5.0-9.6, depending on the investigator, whereas the 11 subjects given placebos showed negligible change. The difference between these two groups is statistically significant (P<0.05). during the second period, the subjects who had been given placebos in the first study received supplements; they showed an average IQ increase of at least 10.2, a highly significant gain (P<0.001). Three of the five subjects who were given supplements for both periods showed additional IQ gains during the second 4 months. Three of four children with Down syndrome gained between 10 and 25 units in IQ and also showed physical changes toward normal. Other evidence suggests that the supplement improved visual acuity in two children and increased growth rates.

Arkansas, Fayetteville, 72701, Ark., United States","The variation of protein content and biological values of Pinto and Kidney beans as affected by early harvest dates was studied. The mature beans were harvested 1 week apart for 4 weeks, water blanched, and processed. Harvest dates had little effect on protein quality of Pinto and Kidney beans. Kidney beans had a higher protein content than Pinto beans and both had only minor variations in crude protein between harvest dates. Only two amino acids, methionine and aspartic acid, had significant differences in levels between harvest date. The bean quality was evaluated by feeding male rats levels of both beans and casein to supply 10% protein. The addition of 0.4% DL methionine to both Pinto and Kidney bean diets resulted in a significant increase in weight gain, feed efficiency, and PER, which were similar to those obtained for rats fed casein. The low weight gains, feed efficiency and PER observed in the bean diets of two harvests were probably due to the onset of germination that occurred due to wet conditions during tha harvesting sequence.",,"aspartic acid; methionine; animal experiment; bean; higher plant; nutritional value",,"aspartic acid, 56-84-8, 6899-03-2; methionine, 59-51-8, 63-68-3, 7005-18-7",,,,,,,,,,,,,00296635,,NURIB,,"English","NUTR.

These diets were: diet C consisting of commercial Rat Chow; diet CG, the same diet diluted with 70% glucose calories, diet A, a simulated 'American' diet made up of 25 widely used foods; diet AS, the same diet supplemented with small amounts of 25 vitamins and minerals. The rats were observed for 69 days under different circumstances and treatments to ascertain the existence of hitherto unused criteria which might advantageously be applied in nutritional studies. Among the less traditional criteria found to be significantly affected by the diet were: voluntary consumption of food; sleeping time after anesthesia; weight gain after surgery; healing time after surgery; hair growth after clipping; voluntary sugar consumption; and recovery time after cyanide poisoning. These findings suggest that there are probably many other unexplored criteria which could be used advantageously in nutritional experimentation.",,"anesthesia; body weight; diagnosis; diet; etiology; hair growth; methodology; rat; wound healing; Anesthesia, Intravenous; Animal; Animal Feed; Body Weight; Cyanides; Diet; Eating; Hair; Longevity; Male; Nutrition; Nutritional Requirements; Pentobarbital; Rats; Skin; Sleep; Sucrose; Time Factors; United States; Wound Healing",,"Cyanides; Pentobarbital, 76-74-4; Sucrose, 57-50-1",,,,,,,,,,,,,00029165,,AJCNA,937225,"English","AM.
