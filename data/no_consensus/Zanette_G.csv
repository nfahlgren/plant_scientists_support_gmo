The Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) is a brief, simple questionnaire consisting of five questions with a total score ranging from 5 to 25, the Italian version of which is not available yet. The aim of the study was to provide an Italian version of the MDAS and check its reliability in oral surgery, which is a major cause of dental anxiety due to the expected perception of pain and suffering. Methods: The Italian version of the test was administered to 230 patients (98 male and 132 female patients, ages 14-88 years) undergoing oral surgery. Further recorded data were: American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status classification (ASA-PS), frequency of visiting the dentist and any previous distressing experiences in dental or medical setting. Results: The internal consistency of the test was high, with a Cronbach's alpha=0.92.The MDAS score was significantly higher in females (P<0.0001) and in patients with previous distressing experiences in medical and/or dental settings (P<0.0001); the correlation with age (P=0.01) and frequency on visiting the dentist (P=0.02) were also significant. Conclusions: The patients' selection (oral surgery only) may be a limit of the study, which might not provide an estimation of anxiety prevalence in the general dental population; however our result agree with those of studies performed in other Countries in the generic population, suggesting the absence of major differences with respect to the surgical setting and show the reliability and manageability of the Italian version of MDAS.","Dental anxiety; Dentistry; Preoperative care; Psychological tests","adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety assessment; Article; dental anxiety; dentist; female; human; Italy; local anesthesia; major clinical study; male; Modified Dental Anxiety Scale; nociception; oral surgery; phobia; preoperative care; preoperative evaluation; very elderly",,,,,,"Cowpe, J., Plasschaert, A., Harzer, W., Vinkka-Puhakka, H., Walmsley, A.D., Profile and competences for the graduating european dentist - Update 2009 (2010) Eur J Dent Educ, 14, pp. 193-202; Kent, G., Croucher, R., (1998) Achieving Oral Health: The Social Context of Dentistry, , Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann; Facco, E., Zanette, G., Favero, L., Bacci, C., Sivolella, S., Cavallin, F., Toward the validation of visual analogue scale for anxiety (2011) Anesth Prog, 58, pp. 8-13; Facco, E., Zanette, G., Manani, G., Italian version of Corah's dental anxiety scale: Normative data in patients undergoing oral surgery and relationship with the ASA physical status classification (2008) Anesth Prog, 55, pp. 109-115; Gatchel, R.J., The prevalence of dental fear and avoidance: Expanded adult and recent adolescent surveys (1989) J Am Dent Assoc, 118, pp. 591-593; Erten, H., Akarslan, Z.Z., Bodrumlu, E., Dental fear and anxiety levels of patients attending a dental clinic (2006) Quintessence Int, 37, pp. 304-310; Kanegane, K., Penha, S.S., Borsatti, M.A., Rocha, R.G., Dental anxiety in an emergency dental service (2003) Rev Saude Publica, 37, pp. 786-792; Kaakko, T., Milgrom, P., Coldwell, S.E., Getz, T., Weinstein, P., Ramsay, D.S., Dental fear among university students: Implications for pharmacological research (1998) Anesth Prog, 45, pp. 62-67; Moore, R., Birn, H., Kirkegaard, E., Brodsgaard, I., Scheutz, F., Prevalence and characteristics of dental anxiety in danish adults (1993) Community Dent Oral Epidemiol, 21, pp. 292-296; Haugejorden, O., Klock, K.S., Avoidance of dental visits: The predictive validity of three dental anxiety scales (2000) Acta Odontol Scand, 58, pp. 255-259; Smith, T.A., Heaton, L.J., Fear of dental care: Are we making any progress?

MMN amplitude was recorded using a 19-channel montage and then processed using the low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to localize its sources. MMN amplitude was significantly decreased during hypnotic amusia (p <.04) only in HH, where the LORETA maps of MMN showed a decreased source amplitude in the left temporal lobe, suggesting a hypnotic top-down regulation of activity of these areas and that these changes can be assessed by neurophysiological investigations. © 2014 Copyright International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis.",,"adult;

Pharmacological sedation has been used more and more over the past two decades, in order to relieve dental anxiety and phobia and let the patient face oral surgery safely. Hypnosis is a still underused but powerful non-pharmacological tool in dentistry. It provides an effective sedation whilst maintaining patient collaboration, but it also may help patients recovering from dental anxiety and phobia as well as those with a severe gag reflex. While pharmacological sedation affords a temporary respite and helps the patient to cope with a single procedure, hypnosis can effectively allow for both an excellent sedation in a physiological way and the treatment of patients' anxiety, or substantially decrease the doses used for sedative and analgesic drugs when these are needed.",,"adult; article; case report; conscious sedation; dental anxiety; female; human; hypnosis; methodology; oral surgery; psychological aspect; Adult; Conscious Sedation; Dental Anxiety; Female; Humans; Hypnosis; Surgery, Oral",,,,,,,"Facco, E.",,,,,,,,00491160,,,24624516,"English","SAAD Dig",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898008479

The Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A) seems to be effective, fast and manageable, but has not been fully validated yet. The aim of this study is to validate VAS-A comparing it to, Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale (CDAS) Spielberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Methods. One hundred consecutive patients (38 males and 62 females, median age 49 years) submitted to oral surgery filled out the VAS-A, CDAS, STAI forms Y1 and Y2, and BDI at preoperative examination; the order of administration of tests was randomized. Results. VAS-A score was significantly correlated to CDAS (P<0.0001), STAI-Y1 (P<0.0001), STAI-Y2 (P<0.002) but not to BDI (P=0.18). ROC curve analysis suggested VAS-A equal to 46 mm as threshold for anxiety when using STAI Y1 equal to 40 as reference cutoff. Conclusion. Our study confirms that VAS-A is a reliable indicator of preoperative anxiety and may detect patients with depressive symptoms also. Values of VAS-A around 50 mm are a reliable threshold for a clinically meaningful level of preoperative anxiety.","Anxiety; Dentistry; Depression; Perioperative care; Psychological tests; Surgical procedures, operative","adult;

The aim of this paper was to determine whether the use of midazolam is a better technique than the use of diazepam, in relation with the definition of conscious sedation in dentistry. Methods. Eighty-eight patients undergoing oral surgery were divided into 2 groups in which the sedation was randomly achieved with equipotent cumulative doses of diazepam and midazolam, up to a maximum dose of 8 and 4 mg respectively. Patient's tranquillity was assessed after every dose, using a visual analogue score to ten points and the sedation was evaluated as mild, moderate or deep. Blood pressure, heart rate and SpO2 were also recorded. Psychomotor conditions, by Newman test, and the incidence of amnesia and the patient's satisfaction, by telephone interview, were both evaluated. Results. The number of patients who reached maximum subjective tranquillity was greater already after the third dose of diazepam. The average scores of tranquillity were higher after diazepam. Patients treated with diazepam experienced a higher incidence of mild sedation, patients treated with midazolam a higher incidence of moderate and deep sedation. In patients treated with midazolam blood pressure, heart rate and SpO2 were lower. Postoperative recovery was similar in the 2 groups. After midazolam patients experienced greater amnesia for local anesthesia and drowsiness. Satisfaction was high with both treatments. Conclusion. The study shows that sedation with diazepam is more in line with the definition of conscious sedation in dentistry. Diazepam guarantees the persistence of consciousness and maximum subjective tranquillity levels. The recovery and satisfaction were comparable in the 2 groups.","Conscious sedation; Dentistry; Diazepam; Midazolam","diazepam; midazolam; adult; amnesia; article; controlled study; dental patient; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient satisfaction; postoperative care; randomized controlled trial; sedation; teleconsultation; tranquilizing activity; Adult; Conscious Sedation; Diazepam; Female; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Male; Midazolam; Middle Aged; Oral Surgical Procedures",,"diazepam, 439-14-5; midazolam, 59467-70-8",,,,"(2007) Guidelines for the Appointment of Dentists with a Special Interest (DwST) in Conscious Sedation, p. 2. , Department of Health.

It has a wide-ranging and dynamic impact in patients' lives and shows some links with other anxiety disorders, as described in psychiatry, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobia. Pharmacological sedation has been introduced and used more and more over the past two decades, in order to relieve dental anxiety and phobia and let the patient face oral surgery safely. However, its use is only a step in a much more complex approach, the aim of which is helping the patient to overcome their anxiety and get rid of it. The appropriate approach includes several steps: (1) assessing dental anxiety; (2) proper communication and ensuring patients are thoroughly informed; (3) iatrosedation to make patients comfortable and earn their trust; (4) a properly performed local anaesthesia, able to ensure a full analgesia; and (5) hypnosis and/or a wise use of drugs to ensure full anxiety control as needed. Iatrosedation combines the principles of verbal and non-verbal communication and the emphatic approach pertaining to neurolinguistic programming. Given its effectiveness in relieving dental anxiety, it should be regarded as the essential strategy of communication with the patient. Hypnosis is a powerful tool in dentistry. A relevant advantage, unique to hypnosis, is its twofold role: (1) achieving an effective and even deep sedation and amnesia while maintaining the patient's collaboration; and (2) treating dental anxiety and phobia, helping the patient to overcome it, as well as other associated anxiety disorders (e.g., claustrophobia).As far as eye movement desensitizaion and reprocessing (EMDR) is concerned, there is still a shortage of information on EMDR in dentistry, but it might be potentially useful when dental phobia is related to previous bad experiences involving PTSD components. The superiority of hypnosis and other behavioural techniques in comparison with pharmacological sedation lies in their ability to help patients rid themselves of their dental anxiety. While pharmacological sedation only affords a temporary respite and helps the patient to cope with a single procedure, hypnosis and iatrosedation can effectively allow for both an excellent sedation in a physiological way and the treatment of patient's anxiety, helping them to get rid of their fear and other anxiety components. © 2012 British Society of Clinical and Academic Hypnosis.","Dentistry; Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing; Hypnosis; Iatrosedation; Neurolinguistic programming; Psychological tests",,,,,,,"Abrahamsson, K.H., Berggren, U., Hallberg, L., Carlsson, S.G., Dental phobic patients' view of dental anxiety and experiences in dental care: A qualitative study (2002) Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences, 16, pp. 188-196; Acharya, S., Factors affecting dental anxiety and beliefs in an Indian population (2008) Journal of Oral Rehabilitation, 35, pp. 259-267; Adair, S.M., Waller, J.L., Schafer, T.E., Rockman, R.A., A survey of members of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry on their use of behavior management techniques (2004) Pediatric Dental Journal, 26, pp. 159-166; Aitken, R.C., Measurement of feelings using visual analogue scales (1969) Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, 62, pp. 989-993; Bae, H., Kim, D., Park, Y.C., Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing for adolescent depression (2008) Psychiatry Investigation, 5, pp. 60-65; Bandler, R., Grindler, J., (1975) The Structure of Magic.

The hypnotic protocol included hypnotic focused analgesia and a pre-operative pain threshold test. Tfter inducing hypnosis, a wide excision was performed, preserving the deep fascia, and the tumour was removed; the patient's heart rate and blood pressure did not increase during the procedure. When the patient was de-hypnotised, she reported no pain and was discharged immediately. Our case confirms the efficacy of hypnosis and demonstrates that it may be valuable as a sole anaesthetic method in selected cases. Hypnosis can prevent pain perception and surgical stress as a whole, comparing well with anaesthetic drugs.

The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of traditional acupuncture and valproic acid in migraine prophylaxis. Methods. A prospective, controlled study was performed in 100 patients affected by migraine without aura lasting for over one year. The patients were stratified for sex and randomly divided into two groups of 50 patients each. Patients belonging to Group A (acupuncture) were submitted to 20 sessions of acupuncture, while patients belonging to Group V valproate) were administered Valproic acid (Depakin Chrono®) at a dose of 600 mg/day; 10 mg Rizatriptan wafers were allowed as needed to treat the attacks. The Midas Index (MI) and pain intensity (PI, by VAS) were recorded before treatment (T0), at three (T 1) and six (T2) months; a six-point scale Pain Relief score (PRS), the Rizatriptan intake and adverse events were recorded at T 1 and T2. Results. Eighty-two out of 100 patients completed the study (9 dropouts in each group). In both groups the MI improved at T1 and T2(P&lt;0.0001). Pain intensity was better at T1 in group V (P&lt;0.0001), but PI and PRS (P=0.02) as well as rizatriptan intake (P=0.001) were better in group A at T2. The rate of adverse events was 47.8% in group V and 0% in group A. Conclusion. Our data show a lower pain intensity and lower Rizatriptan intake at six-months follow-up with no adverse events in acupuncture patients compared to those treated with valproic acid.","Acupuncture; Migraine without aura;

Materials and methods: A wide historical and bibliographic note is explained. In Europe, dentists are entitled just to conscious sedation, administration. It allows the practitioner to safely perform dental procedures without discomfort for the patient, to relieve and eliminate anxiety and to increase patient acceptance and compliance. Among titrable techniques, inhalation nitrous oxide: oxygen technique and intravenously administered benzodiazepines with prevalent central depression action are the favourite. Among non-titrable techniques we mention the enteral administration. Results and conclusions: To learn how to use these techniques post-graduation courses, organized by University or by specialized continuing education and training society are required, as stated by the actual laws. © 2012 Elsevier Srl.

AUC values were significantly lower after midazolam when compared to AUC values registered in diazepam treated patients; 22.6% of the group 3 patients showed BIS values <80, versus 0.4% of group 1 patients. Diazepam has a safer profile, with BIS values and clinical conditions according to the definition of minimal and/or moderate sedation.

The approach regarded as the safest involves the interruption of OAT and temporary treatment with heparin (the so-called heparin window protocol). Materials and methods: A 66-year-old man was referred to our staff by a cardiologist. The patient was awaiting for a heart transplantation. Due to the presence of periodontal disease, most of his teeth needed to be extracted. The patient's physician was instructed to discontinue warfarin therapy and replace it with low-molecular-weight heparin. Despite precautions, severe bleeding occurred on postoperative day 3, which required transfusions and two weeks of hospitalization. Results and conclusions: The heparin window protocol is considered the safest way to perform dental procedures in patientson OAT. Thepresent case illustrates that the use of the heparin window with INR values in the optimal range is not always sufficient to exclude the risk of bleeding complications. © 2010 Elsevier Srl.

The aim of this study is to check VAS-A effectiveness in more than 1000 patients submitted to implantology. The VAS-A and the Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) were administered preoperatively to 1114 patients (459 males and 655 females, age 54.7 ± 13.1 years). Statistical analysis was conducted with Pearson correlation coefficient, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and McNemar tests. A close correlation between DAS and VAS-A was found (r = 0.57, P < .0001); the VAS-A thresholds of dental anxiety and phobia were 5.1 and 7.0 cm, respectively. Despite a significant concordance of tests in 800 cases (72%), disagreement was found in the remaining 314 cases (28%), and low DAS was associated with high VAS-A (230 cases) or vice versa (84 cases). Our study confirms that VAS-A is a simple, sensitive, fast, and reliable tool in dental anxiety assessment. The rate of disagreement between VAS-A and DAS is probably due to different test sensitivities to different components of dental anxiety. VAS-A can be used effectively in the assessment of dental patients, using the values of 5.1 cm and 7.0 cm as cutoff values for anxiety and phobia, respectively.",,"area under the curve; article; classification; dental anxiety; female; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; Area Under Curve; Dental Anxiety; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index",,,,,,,"Facco, E.email: enrico.facco@unipd.it",,,,,,,,00033006,,,21410359,"English","Anesth Prog",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957825318

Methods: National survey to collect data about current sedation teaching and practice in Italy. The survey covered all 33 Dental Schools in Italy and 150 dental office located in Veneto region. Results: All the 33 surveyed Dental Schools and 110 (73 %) of the 150 surveyed dentists completed the questionnaire. Sedation is taught in most of the Dental Schools, and some Universities also have postgraduate education programs on this topic. In the setting of academic Italian Dentistry, sedation is provided mainly by anaesthesiologists (94%) and only rarely by dentists (6%). In the private dental practice, the anaesthesiologist performs the sedation in about 20% of the cases, the remainder being performed by dentists and physicians. Clinical significance: Sedation teachers in Italy are anaesthesiologists, but conscious sedation is not their preferred topic. This teaching is mainly theoretical, while practical training is lacking in the majority of the Dental Schools. Sedation for paediatric and/or disabled patients is rarely taught, because these patients are mainly treated under general anaesthesia. In the Dental Schools, anaesthesiologists perform most of the sedations, whereas in private dental office dentists perform this duty more frequently. The Italian dental anaesthesia teachers have, indeed to walk a long path, to establish a clear definition of objectives, competences and limits of the modern dentist, in order to get common professional profile and legal framework. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A group of 60 patients was randomised into two groups. One group had the Kenneth Reed technique used to administer an inferior alveolar nerve block whilst the other received the Gow-Gates technique. The efficacy of nerve block produced was evaluated both clinically and by electric pulp tester. MRI examination was undertaken to determine the spread of local anaesthetic. There were no significant differences in success rate of anaesthesia between groups. The failure rate for the Gow-Gates technique was 16.6%, whilst the failure rate for the Kenneth Reed technique was 23.3%. Time to onset was less with the Kenneth Reed technique. MRI examination showed the solution was more widely distributed after the Kenneth Reed block had been used. Our research has demonstrated that the Kenneth Reed technique is equally effective at producing anaesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve. Compared with conventional techniques there is a lower incidence of positive aspiration and potential for lower morbidity as the local anaesthetic is deposited further from the neurovascular bundle than when deposited near the mandibular foramen as in most conventional Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block techniques.",,"local anesthetic agent; adult; article; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dental anesthesia; drug effect; female; histology; human; injection; innervation; lip; male; mandible; mandible condyle; mandibular nerve; masticatory muscle; methodology; middle aged; needle; nerve block; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain assessment; patient satisfaction; randomized controlled trial; sensation; temporalis muscle; time; tooth arch; tooth pulp disease; Adult; Anesthesia, Dental; Anesthetics, Local; Dental Arch; Dental Pulp Test; Female; Humans; Injections; Lip; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mandible; Mandibular Condyle; Mandibular Nerve; Middle Aged; Needles; Nerve Block; Pain Measurement; Patient Satisfaction; Pterygoid Muscles; Sensation; Temporal Muscle; Time Factors",,"Anesthetics, Local",,,,,"Zanette, G.",,,,,,,,00491160,,,21323031,"English","SAAD Dig",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955005074

Every patient evaluated the information received at the end of the preoperative visit and in the postoperative period. One hundred-fifty dental patients were asked about the most appreciated information received in the preoperative visit on the anxiolytic technique, local anesthesia and treatment of the perioperative pain. Afterwards the patients had to report on their reaction to the content of the preoperative visit and information quality. On a phone interview they had to evaluate their appreciation of the anxiolytic technique, their perception during loco-regional anesthesia and incidence of pain and edema. The most appreciated details were those on the intervention, pharmacologic treatment, postoperative complicances, postoperative pain and operative competence; less appreciated were those on loco-regional anesthesia, duration of the intervention, anxiolytic techniques, hospital reception and permanence in the hospital. Ninety-eight percent of the patients considered to have been adequately informed on a context judged to be extraordinary (99.3%), 96.6% indicated the information as necessary, 98.6% appreciated the treatment of the intraoperative and postoperative (99.3%) pain and 99.3% the anxiolytic treatment. On the telephone interview, 100% of patients expressed satisfaction for the experienced intraoperative tranquillity, 91.3% complained for not having received in the past a similar preoperative visit, 99.3% wished a diffused application of the information. The loco-regional anesthesia was associated to psychological detachment in 84% of the cases and the incidence of postoperative pain was of 36%. The information on the anxiolytic techniques, loco-regional anesthesia, treatment of perioperative pain and postoperative distress was enthusiastically accepted and albeit initially induced feelings of astonishment resulted to be appreciated and preferred in the whole of the patients.",,"anxiolytic agent; hypnotic sedative agent; adult; anxiety; article; clinical competence; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dental anesthesia; fear; female; hospitalization; human; interview; local anesthesia; male; middle aged; oral surgery; patient education; patient satisfaction; postoperative pain; preoperative care; psychological aspect; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; Adult; Anesthesia, Dental; Anesthesia, Local; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Anxiety; Clinical Competence; Fear; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Surgical Procedures; Pain, Postoperative; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Satisfaction; Preoperative Care; Questionnaires",,"Anti-Anxiety Agents; Hypnotics and Sedatives",,,,,"Manani, G.email: gmanani@supereva.it",,,,,,,,00264970,,,20940688,"English; Italian","Minerva Stomatol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952673391

This randomized placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate two premedicants, ketamine versus a combination of fentanyl- droperidol, rectally administered, in pediatric surgical outpatients. Methods We randomly assigned 120 children to three equal groups to be rectally premedicated with ketamine 10 mg kg -1 (group K), fentanyl 5 μg kg-1 + droperidol 100 lg kg-1 (group F), or saline 0.2 ml kg-1 (group P). A blinded observer scored the children's behavior, according to a four-category behavioral scale, before premedication (time A), 45 min after premedication (time B), immediately before venipuncture (time C), and during the venipuncture (time D). Features of the premedication technique, complications, parents' opinions, and contraindicationsto hospital discharge were recorded. Results Patient discharge was delayed because of anesthesia side effects in 7 cases (5.8%) and surgical problems in 9 (7.5%). Group F showed a higher rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) than group K, whereas the latter had a higher rate of behavioral disturbances. The data showed a significant difference in the behavioral score between groups F and P, groups K and P, and groups F and K at time B, and between groups K and P at time C. The reaction score at venipuncture shows a significant difference between groups K and P only. Conclusion In this study, premedication with rectal ketamine showed significantly better overall results in the preoperative period than premedication with either fentanyl- droperidol or placebo. © Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists 2010.","Droperidol; Fentanyl; Ketamine; Pediatric outpatients; Rectal premedication","droperidol plus fentanyl; ketamine; placebo; sodium chloride; article; behavior disorder; child; child behavior; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; hospital discharge; human; male; pediatrics; postoperative nausea and vomiting; premedication; preoperative period; preschool child; randomized controlled trial; vein puncture; Administration, Rectal; Analgesics; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Droperidol; Female; Fentanyl; Humans; Infant; Ketamine; Male; Premedication; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",,"droperidol plus fentanyl, 8004-27-1, 8067-59-2; ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; Analgesics; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Droperidol, 548-73-2; Fentanyl, 437-38-7; Ketamine, 6740-88-1",,,,"Thomas, J., Brute force or gentle persuasion?

Methods: National survey to collect data about current sedation teaching and practice in Italy. The survey covered all 33 Dental Schools in Italy and 150 dental office located in Veneto region. Results: All the 33 surveyed Dental Schools and 110 (73 %) of the 150 surveyed dentists completed the questionnaire. Sedation is taught in most of the Dental Schools, and some Universities also have postgraduate education programs on this topic. In the setting of academic Italian Dentistry, sedation is provided mainly by anaesthesiologists (94%) and only rarely by dentists (6%). In the private dental practice, the anaesthesiologist performs the sedation in about 20% of the cases, the remainder being performed by dentists and physicians. Clinical significance: Sedation teachers in Italy are anaesthesiologists, but conscious sedation is not their preferred topic. This teaching is mainly theoretical, while practical training is lacking in the majority of the Dental Schools. Sedation for paediatric and/or disabled patients is rarely taught, because these patients are mainly treated under general anaesthesia. In the Dental Schools, anaesthesiologists perform most of the sedations, whereas in private dental office dentists perform this duty more frequently. The Italian dental anaesthesia teachers have, indeed to walk a long path, to establish a clear definition of objectives, competences and limits of the modern dentist, in order to get common professional profile and legal framework. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,,,,"Betti, D., Mariuzzi, M.L., Manani, G., L'etica del dolore in odontoiatria (2003) J.

A 91-years-old, ASA III, female patient, was scheduled for traumatologic surgery; she presented the following clinical picture: a psychiatric disorder, parkinsonism, cardiac ischemia and atrial fibrillation, cronic obstructive lung disease. Traumatic lesions were: skull fracture, fractures of 13 ribs, of the left omerus, left forearm, left rotula and tibia. Materials and methods: General anaesthesia was excluded because of possible interactions with preoperative medications and cardiopulmonary status, so a multiple regional blockades technique was selected. The sequence of regional blocks was as follows: 1) interscalene block, 2) axillary block, 3) thoracic epidural catheter, 4) subarachnoid anaesthesia. During the multiple osteosynthesis a light sedation, obtained with propofol infusion was maintained. Results: The selected technique permitted the scheduled surgery with minimal alteration of homeostasis, avoiding the disvantages of general anaesthesia, and preserving the advantages of regional anaesthesia. Discussion: Compared to general anaesthesia, multiple regional anaesthesia technique is more time demanding and consuming. Patient comfort is another important concern during long operations under regional anaesthesia, moreover, some well-known complications of each regional anaesthesia technique should be anticipated, but in a minority of cases.","Axillary block; Critical patient; Epidural block; Interscalene block; Regional anaesthesia; Spinal block","alfentanil; amantadine; aminophylline; amitriptyline; diazepam; digoxin; nitro derivative; perphenazine; propofol; ropivacaine; aged; anesthesiological techniques; arm fracture; article; axial brachial plexus blocking; case report; chronic obstructive lung disease; continuous infusion; drug dose titration; epidural anesthesia; epidural catheter; female; fracture treatment; geriatric patient; heart atrium fibrillation; high risk patient; human; intermethod comparison; interscalene block; ischemic heart disease; leg fracture; mental disease; multiple trauma; nerve block; orthopedic surgery; osteosynthesis; parkinsonism; regional anesthesia; rib fracture; skull fracture; spinal anesthesia; surgical patient; treatment outcome",,"alfentanil, 69049-06-5, 71195-58-9; amantadine, 665-66-7, 768-94-5; aminophylline, 317-34-0; amitriptyline, 50-48-6, 549-18-8; diazepam, 439-14-5; digoxin, 20830-75-5, 57285-89-9; perphenazine, 58-39-9; propofol, 2078-54-8; ropivacaine, 84057-95-4",,,,"Rodgers, A., Walker, N., Schug, S., McKee, A., Kehlet, H., van Zundert, A., Sage, D., MacMahon, S., Reduction of postoperative mortality and morbidity with epidural or spinal anaesthesia: Results from overview of randomised trials (2000) BMJ, 321, pp. 1-12; Ballantyne, J.C., Does regional anesthesia improve outcome after surgery?

Resuscitation was started immediately and successfully. The clinical scenario seems confirm an epidural extension of anaesthesia, a rare complication of continuous psoas compartment block. This observation reminds us that an uncommon complication may present suddenly despite the best planning.

Background. - Migraine prevalence is high and affects a relevant rate of adults in the productive phase of their life. Acupuncture has been increasingly advocated and used in Western countries for migraine treatment, but the evidence of its effectiveness still remains weak. A large variability of treatments is present in published studies and no acupoint selection according to TCM has been investigated so far; therefore, the low level of evidence of acupuncture effectiveness might partly depend on inappropriate treatment. Design and Methods. - A prospective, randomized, controlled study was performed in 160 patients suffering from migraine without aura, assessed according to the ICD-10 classification. The patients were divided into the following 4 groups: (1) group TA, treated with true acupuncture (according to TCM) plus Rizatriptan; (2) group RMA, treated with ritualized mock acupuncture plus Rizatriptan; (3) group SMA, treated with standard mock acupuncture plus Rizatriptan; (4) group R, without prophylactic treatment with relief therapy only (Rizatriptan). The MIDAS Questionnaire was administered before treatment (T0), at 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2) from the beginning of treatment, and the MIDAS Index (MI) was calculated. Rizatriptan intake was also checked in all groups of patients at T0, T1, and T2. Group TA and RMA were evaluated according to TCM as well; then, the former was submitted to true acupuncture and the latter to mock acupuncture treatment resembling the same as TA. The statistical analysis was conducted with factorial ANOVA and multiple tests with a Bonferroni adjustment. Results. - A total of 127 patients completed the study (33 dropouts): 32 belonged to group TA, 30 to group RMA, 31 to group SMA, and 34 to group R. Before treatment the MI (T0) was moderate to severe with no significant intergroup differences. All groups underwent a decrease of MI at T1 and T2, with a significant group difference at both T1 and T2 compared to T0 (P &lt;.0001). Only TA provided a significant improvement at both T1 and T2 compared to R (P &lt;.0001). RMA underwent a transient improvement of MI at T1. The Rizatriptan intake paralleled the MI in all groups. Conclusions. - TA was the only treatment able to provide a steady outcome improvement in comparison to the use of only Rizatriptan, while RMA showed a transient placebo effect at T1. © 2008 the Authors.","Acupuncture; MIDAS questionnaire; Migraine; Mock acupuncture; Outcome; Rizatriptan","rizatriptan; acupuncture; adult; analysis of variance; article; Chinese medicine; clinical assessment tool; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; migraine; migraine with aura; migraine without aura; outcome assessment; prevalence; priority journal; prophylaxis; prospective study; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; standard; statistical analysis; treatment outcome; treatment response; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged; Migraine Disorders; Placebos; Serotonin Agonists; Single-Blind Method; Triazoles; Tryptamines",,"rizatriptan, 144034-80-0, 145202-66-0; Placebos; rizatriptan, 145202-66-0; Serotonin Agonists; Triazoles; Tryptamines",,,,"Pradalier, A., Auray, J.P., El Hasnaoui, A., Economic impact of migraine and other episodic headaches in France: Data from the GRIM2000 study (2004) Pharmacoeconomics., 22, pp. 985-999; Bigal, M.E., Rapoport, A.M., Bordini, C.A., Tepper, S.J., Sheftell, F.D., Speciali, J.G., Burden of migraine in Brazil: Estimate of cost of migraine to the public health system and an analytical study of the cost-effectiveness of a stratified model of care (2003) Headache., 43, pp. 742-754; Lambert, J., Carides, G.W., Meloche, J.P., Gerth, W.C., Marentette, M.A., Impact of migraine symptoms on health care use and work loss in Canada in patients randomly assigned in a phase III clinical trial (2002) Can J Clin Pharmacol., 9, pp. 158-164; Gerth, W.C., Carides, G.W., Dasbach, E.J., Visser, W.H., Santanello, N.C., The multinational impact of migraine symptoms on healthcare utilisation and work loss (2001) Pharmacoeconomics., 19, pp. 197-206; Diamond, M.L., The role of concomitant headache types and non-headache co-morbidities in the under-diagnosis of migraine (2002) Neurology., 58, pp. S3. , S9; Harpole, L.H., Samsa, G.P., Jurgelski, A.E., Shipley, J.L., Bernstein, A., Matchar, D.B., Headache management program improves outcome for chronic headache (2003) Headache., 43, pp. 715-724; Okuma, H., Kitagawa, Y., Takagi, S., Clinical efficacy of rizatriptan for patients with migraine: Efficacy of drug therapy for migraine accompanied by tension headache-like symptoms focusing on neck stiffness (2005) J Headache Pain., 6, pp. 455-458; Kaniecki, R., Totten, J., Cervicalgia in migraine: Prevalence,clinical characteristics, and response to treatment (2001) Cephalalgia., 21, p. 296. , Abstract); Acupuncture (1998) JAMA., 280, pp. 1518-1524. , NIH Consensus Conference; Larner, A.J., Acupuncture use for the treatment of headache prior to neurological referral (2005) J Headache Pain., 6, pp. 97-99; Manias, P., Tagaris, G., Karageorgiou, K., Acupuncture in headache: A critical review (2000) Clin J Pain., 16, pp. 334-339; Vernon, H., McDermaid, C.S., Hagino, C., Systematic review of randomized clinical trials of complementary/ alternative therapies in the treatment of tension-type and cervicogenic headache (1999) Complement Ther Med., 7, pp. 142-155; Linde, K., Scholz, M., Melchart, D., Willich, S.N., Should systematic reviews include non-randomized and uncontrolled studies? the case of acupuncture for chronic headache (2002) J Clin Epidemiol., 55, pp. 77-85; Melchart, D., Linde, K., Fischer, P., Acupuncture for recurrent headaches: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (1999) Cephalalgia., 19, pp. 779-786; Melchart, D., Linde, K., Fischer, P., Acupuncture for idiopathic headache (Cochrane review) (2001) Cochrane Database Syst Rev., 1, pp. CD001218; Linde, K., Streng, A., Jurgens, S., Acupuncture for patients with migraine: A randomized controlled trial (2005) JAMA., 293, pp. 2118-2125; Wonderling, D., Vickers, A.J., Grieve, R., McCarney, R., Cost effectiveness analysis of a randomised trial of acupuncture for chronic headache in primary care (2004) BMJ., 328, p. 747; Vickers, A.J., Rees, R.W., Zollman, C.E., Acupuncture for chronic headache in primary care: Large, pragmatic, randomised trial (2004) BMJ., 328, p. 744; Ceccherelli, F., Facco, E., Methodological problems on acupunture research in pain therapy (2005) Methodological Problems on Acupunture Research in Pain Therapy., , In: Capasso, A., ed.

METHODS: Third molar extraction under regional anaesthesia (inferior alveolar and buccal nerve blocks) was performed in 2 groups of 30 patients each: group 1 = controls, group 2 = EDA treatment. Anxiety and pain level were reported by means of Visual Analogue Scale, postoperative pain description with the McGill Pain Questionnaire. A postoperative phone interview to all patients was made. Computerized randomization was performed; values expressed as mean+/-SD, data comparison evaluated by means of ANOVA and chi squared, statistical significance indicated by P values <0.05. RESULTS: Features of the patients and surgical interventions were similar. EDA has determined lower pain level; moreover, the control patients has shown higher values of blood pressure and heart frequency. Phone interview has reported no amnesia about the perioperative events. A smaller number of EDA treated patients has reported pain during needle prick and/or intraoperatively; 80% of the EDA treated patients has reported a good opinion about the treatment, 93% of the patients would repeat the treatment, if needed. CONCLUSION: EDA is a complementary analgesic technique for dental surgery. Cardiovascular changes, frequently observed during third molar extraction, were not present in the EDA treated patients. These data confirm that EDA is able to modify the physiologic responses to stressful events, blunting the adrenergic upset, maybe by means of an analgesic action on A, fiber and an increase of endorphins' central level. These results underline that the complementary use of EDA in the third molar extraction may be better than regional anaesthesia alone.",,"adult; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dental anesthesia; female; human; local anesthesia; male; methodology; molar tooth; nerve block; randomized controlled trial; tooth extraction; Adult; Anesthesia, Dental; Anesthesia, Local; Female; Humans; Male; Molar, Third; Nerve Block; Tooth Extraction",,,,,,,"Zanette, G.",,,,,,,,00264970,,,17529914,"English; Italian","Minerva Stomatol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-38449116838

Preoperative evaluation was normal and total intravenous anesthesia with a continuous sciatic nerve block was performed. Two months later, before the second clubfoot correction, a hip subluxation was evident suggesting a provisional diagnosis of neuromuscular disease. Anesthesia was identical, except that a femoral nerve block, necessary to permit a diagnostic muscle biopsy was performed. The perioperative course was uneventful but result of the muscular biopsy was surprising in that central core disease was diagnosed. Although congenital myopathies of all grades and severity exist, they are often mild and underestimated. Patients affected by central core disease are considered susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Because a high prevalence of myopathic changes is reported in children undergoing clubfoot surgery, anesthesiologists must take precautions including a hightened awareness of these events and a high index of suspicion. © 2007 The Authors.","Central core disease; Clubfoot surgery; Malignant hyperthermia; Myopathy; Peripheral nerve block","clonidine; fentanyl; ketamine; paracetamol; propacetamol; propofol; ropivacaine; article; case report; central core disease; clinical examination; clinical feature; clubfoot; diagnostic procedure; femoral nerve; foot surgery; hip dislocation; human; infant; male; muscle biopsy; nerve block; neuromuscular disease; perioperative period; postoperative analgesia; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; reoperation; sciatic nerve; Biopsy; Clubfoot; Diagnosis, Differential; Hip; Humans; Infant; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Myopathy, Central Core; Rare Diseases",,"clonidine, 4205-90-7, 4205-91-8, 57066-25-8; fentanyl, 437-38-7; ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; paracetamol, 103-90-2; propacetamol, 66532-85-2; propofol, 2078-54-8; ropivacaine, 84057-95-4",,,,"Sewry, C.A., Müller, C., Davis, M., The spectrum of pathology in central core disease (2003) Neuromuscul Disord, 12, pp. 930-938; Shy, G.M., Magee, K.R., A new congenital non-progressive myopathy (1956) Brain, 79, pp. 610-621; McCarthy, T.V., Healy, J.M.S., Heffron, J.J.A., Localization of the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility locus to human chromosome 19q12-13.2 (1990) Nature, 343, pp. 562-564; McCarthy, T.V., Quane, K.A., Lynch, P.J., Ryanodine receptor mutations in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease (2000) Hum Mutat, 15, pp. 410-417; Davis, M.R., Haan, E., Jungbluth, H., Principal mutation hotspot for central core disease and related myopathies in the C-terminal transmembrane region of the RYR1 gene (2003) Neuromuscul Disord, 13, pp. 151-157; Mortier, W., Malignant hyperthermia: Relation to other diseases (1990) Acta Anaesthesiol Belg, 41, pp. 119-126; Stelzner, J., Kretz, F.J., Rieger, A., Anaesthetikainduzierter Herzstillstand (1993) Anaesthesist, 42, pp. 44-46; Zanette, G., Manani, G., Pittoni, G., Prevalence of unsuspected myopathy in infants presenting for clubfoot surgery (1995) Paediatr Anaesth, 5, pp. 165-170; Meneghini, L., Zadra, N., Zanette, G., The usefulness of routine preoperative laboratory tests for one day-surgery in healthy children (1998) Paediatr Anaesth, 8, pp. 11-15; Panchal, S.J., Kushnerik, V., Multimodal approaches to improve surgical outcome (2002) Tech Reg Anesth Pain Manag, 6, pp. 70-76; Pham-Dang, C., Kick, O., Collet, T., Continuous peripheral nerve blocks with stimulating catheters (2003) Reg Anesth Pain Med, 28, pp. 83-88; Dalens, B., Tanguy, A., Vanneuville, G., Sciatic nerve blocks in children: Comparison of the posterior, anterior, and lateral approaches in 180 pediatric patients (1990) Anesth Analg, 70, pp. 131-137; Berkowitz, A., Rosenberg, H., Femoral block with mepivacaine for muscle biopsy in malignant hyperthermia patients (1985) Anesthesiology, 62, pp. 651-652; Nelson, T.E., Pharmacogenetics and malignant hyperthermia (1993) Anaesth Pharmacol Rev, 4, pp. 362-376; Sambuughin, N., Sei, Y., Gallagher, K.L., North American malignant hyperthermia population: Screening of the ryanodine receptor gene and identification of novel mutations (2001) Anesthesiology, 95, pp. 594-599; Muntoni, F., Sewry, A.C., Central core disease: New findings in an old disease (2003) Brain, 126, pp. 2339-2340; Litman, R.S., Rosenberg, H., Malignant hyperthermia: Update on susceptibility testing (2005) JAMA, 293, pp. 2918-2924; Gioffrè, E., Dalens, B., Gombert, A., Epidemiology and morbidity of regional anesthesia in children: A one year prospective survey of the French language society of pediatric anesthesiologists (1996) Anesth Analg, 83, pp. 904-912; Lin, C., Durieux, M.E., Ketamine and kids: An update (2005) Pediatr Anesth, 15, pp. 91-97; Adnet, P., Utilisation du Diprivan® dans les myopathies et l'hyperthermie maligne (1994) Ann Fr Anesth Reanim, 13, pp. 490-493","Zanette, G.; Department of Medico-Surgical Specialties, Section of General and Special Anaesthesiology, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 2, 35100 Padova, Italy; email: gastone.zanette@unipd.it",,,,,,,,11555645,,PAANF,17359409,"English","Paediatr.

METHODS: A group of 34 patients undergoing implantology were divided at random into 2 groups of 17. They were evaluated physically, clinically and psychologically. The psychomotor activity was measured by the Newman's test. Preoperative anxiety was treated with chlordemethyldiazepam (CHDDZ) per os, administered before induction of conscious sedation. In the first group, conscious sedation was accomplished by induction with titrated doses of i.v. diazepam, and in the second group with 0.1 mg/kg of intranasal midazolam. BIS values were analysed as Area Under the Curve (AUC). RESULTS: The AUC BIS values after CHDDZ presedation were overlapping in both groups. AUC after midazolam decreased after induction of the conscious sedation (P<0.05), during anesthesia (P<0.01) and during intervention (P<0.01) compared to the diazepam treatment. In the midazolam group the BIS values were on average lower than 90, while in the diazepam group they were on average higher than 95 (P<0.01). The psychomotor recovery was more impaired after midazolam. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that nasal route ensures the quick absorption of midazolam as revealed during the first 3 min from drug administration. The depressant effect of midazolam increased as a function of time, reaching the highest levels during intervention. The results suggest that midazolam is endowed with sedative effects which may compromise the state of consciousness of the patient and be incompatible with the definition of conscious sedation in dentistry.",,"diazepam; hypnotic sedative agent; midazolam; article; clinical trial; conscious sedation; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dental surgery; equipment design; female; human; instrumentation; intranasal drug administration; intravenous drug administration; male; methodology; middle aged; neurologic examination; randomized controlled trial; time; Administration, Intranasal; Conscious Sedation; Dentistry, Operative; Diagnostic Techniques, Neurological; Diazepam; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Injections, Intravenous; Male; Midazolam; Middle Aged; Time Factors",,"diazepam, 439-14-5; midazolam, 59467-70-8; Diazepam, 439-14-5; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Midazolam, 59467-70-8",,,,,"Manani, G.email: Italy.gmanani@supereva.it",,,,,,,,00264970,,,17327813,"English","Minerva Stomatol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848892763

Battisti 267, 35121 Padua, Italy","Background: The classic laryngeal mask airway™ (cLMA) has been demonstrated to be effective for airway management during neonatal resuscitation. However, high airway pressures, when required, cannot be achieved with this device. A neonatal prototype of the LMA-ProSeal™ (PLMA), which might improve the oropharyngeal leak pressure, has recently been produced. The airway sealing pressures of the cLMA and the PLMA were compared in a neonatal manikin. Methods: A neonatal PLMA and a neonatal cLMA were positioned at random in a neonatal intubation manikin (Neonate Airway Trainer; Laerdal, Norway). A Dräeger pressure controlled ventilator (Dräeger 8000; Dräegerwerk AG, Germany) was connected to the airway tubes and increasing inspiratory pressures (from 10 to 40 cm H2O) of positive pressure ventilation applied. The peak and the mean airway pressures obtained with each device were recorded. Results: The airway pressures obtained with PLMA were significantly higher than those obtained with cLMA (p &lt; 0.01) at levels of positive pressure ventilation of 25, 30, 35 and 40 cm H2O. Conclusions: The neonatal PLMA allows higher airway pressure ventilation than the cLMA, in a neonatal intubation manikin. If confirmed clinically, this may have important implications during neonatal resuscitation when high airway pressures are required. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

METHODS: A group of 1 179 consecutive patients undergoing oral surgery in the Dental Clinic of the University of Padua between 2001 and 2003 was evaluated by analysing their anaesthesiological records. The patients were divided into 5 age groups. All were pre-sedated with chlordemethyldiazepam per os, while induction of maximum subjective tranquillity was obtained with fractionated doses of intravenous diazepam. Arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), anxiety level, pathologies, drugs taken, types of intervention, techniques of loco-regional anaesthesia, immediately preoperative AP and HR and tranquillity, intraoperative AP and HR, data regarding postoperative psychomotor recovery, complications and drugs used for the treatment of perioperative pain, were evaluated in each group. RESULTS: Most of the patients (679) were in the 45-64 year-old group. Cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive pathologies proved to be age-dependent. Control AP and HR respectively increased and decreased with age. The doses of chlordemethyldiazepam used induced age-dependent preoperative tranquillity levels. The doses of i.v. diazepam necessary to obtain maximal preoperative subjective tranquillity fell as a function of age. The AP and HR values respectively increased during intervention and decreased in the first hour of intervention. Normal psychomotor recovery was less evident in older patients. The most significant corrective intraoperative interventions consisted of the administration of sublingual hypotensive drugs and in the immediate treatment of some cases of orthostatic hypotension and vaso-vagal syncope. CONCLUSIONS: The sedation technique and the antistress procedures employed proved safe and the intra- or postoperative complications almost non-existent. The variations observed in the parameters considered are compatible with the greater age of the treated subjects.",,"anxiolytic agent; diazepam; adolescent; adult; age; aged; anxiety; article; child; clinical trial; female; human; male; middle aged; oral surgery; preschool child; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Anxiety; Child; Child, Preschool; Diazepam; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Surgical Procedures",,"diazepam, 439-14-5; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Diazepam, 439-14-5",,,,,"Manani, G.email: gmanani@supereva.it",,,,,,,,00264970,,,16224375,"English; Italian","Minerva Stomatol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645460572

The number of children requiring sedation for radiological procedures is increasing. Anaesthesiologists are increasingly involved in giving sedation or general anaesthesia in the rooms of the Radiology Department. This activity is not easy, and can be dangerous. The procedure is often performed on an ambulatory basis, so the child must be alert and discharged rapidly after the procedure. Methods. We reviewed the medical charts of 488 patients in order to evaluate the incidence of complications during deep sedation for diagnostic radiological procedures. The patients were sedated with intravenous thiopental or propofol, or with oral chloral hydrate. All the patients were breathing spontaneously and received only supplemental O2. Results. We found only a few cases of complications, immediately treated without any recourse to tracheal intubation: respiratory failure with arterial desaturation to 94%, regurgitation, vomiting and persistent cough. Conclusions. On the basis of our experience, we believe that deep sedation with endovenous drugs guarantees safety and rapid discharge after the procedure.","Anesthesia; Conscious sedation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatrics; Tomography, X-ray computed","chloral hydrate; oxygen; propofol; thiopental; anesthesia complication; apnea; bradycardia; breathing; coughing; diagnostic procedure; endotracheal intubation; gastroesophageal reflux; human; hypotension; quality control; radiological procedures; respiratory failure; review; sedation; supplementation; vomiting; adolescent; adult; article; child; conscious sedation; female; infant; male; methodology; newborn; preschool child; quality control; radiography; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Conscious Sedation; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Quality Control; Radiography",,"chloral hydrate, 302-17-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; propofol, 2078-54-8; thiopental, 71-73-8, 76-75-5",,,,"Sury, M.R.J., The pros and cons of anaesthesia for children who need radiological procedures (1993) Paediatr Anaesth, 3, pp. 329-331; Spear, R.M., Deep sedation for radiological procedures in children: Enough is enough (1993) Paediatr Anaesth, 3, pp. 325-327; Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients during and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedure (1992) Pediatrics, 89 (6 PART 1), pp. 1110-1115; Barst, S.M., Merola, C.M., Markowitz, A.E., Albarracin, C., Lebowitz, P.W., Bienkowski, R.S., A comparison of propofol and chloral hydrate for sedation of young children during magnetic resonance imaging scans (1994) Paediatr Anaesth, 4, pp. 243-247; Merola, C.M., Albarracin, C., Lebowitz, P.W., Bienkowski, R.S., Barst, S.M., An audit adverse events in children sedated with chloral hydrate or propofol during imaging studies (1995) Paediatr Anaesth, 5, pp. 375-378; Zorab, J.S.M., A general anaesthesia service for magnetic resonance imaging (1995) Eur J Anaesthesiol, 12, pp. 387-395; Tiret, L., Nivoche, Y., Hatton, F., Desmonts, J.M., Vourc'h, G., Complication related to anaesthesia in infants and children.

The dose-effect curves for the hypnotic effect of thiopentone were analysed with the probit system. In the patients treated with flumazenil the ED 50 were higher than those of the controls. The ED 50 of thiopentone after 0.2 mg flumazenil i.v. (3.250 mg/kg) was 26.8% higher (p &lt; 0.01) and after 0.4 mg flumazenil i.v. (3.504 mg/kg) was 36.7% higher (p &lt; 0.001) than the ED 50 of the control (2.563 mg/kg). The authors believe that the antagonist effect of flumazenil on the hypnotic effect of thiopentone may be ascribed to a different modulation induced by flumazenil on the macromolecular complex GABA-benzodiazepine-barbiturate receptor coupled to a chloride channel and endowed with allosteric regulation properties.","Antagonism; Flumazenil; Thiopental","4 aminobutyric acid receptor; anaxate; anesthetic agent; benzodiazepine receptor; benzodiazepine receptor blocking agent; chloride channel; flumazenil; thiopental; unclassified drug; adult; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dose response; female; human; major clinical study; male",,"flumazenil, 78755-81-4; thiopental, 71-73-8, 76-75-5","anaxate",,,"Bransky, G., Meir, P.J., Rieder, E., Walser, H., Wiegler, W.H., Schmid, M., Effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil in hepatic encephalography in humans (1989) Gastroenterology, 97, p. 744; Breimer, L.T.M., Hennis, P.J., Burm, A.G.L., Pharmacokinetics and EEG effects of flumazenil in volunteers (1991) Clin.

We reviewed the medical charts of all children ASA physical status 1 and 2 who underwent a minor surgical procedure in the last 15 years. We excluded all former preterm infants of less than 60 weeks postconceptual age. The series under examination includes two groups of patients: group A includes 1884 children who underwent routine preoperative laboratory tests; group B includes 8772 children who had preoperative, selected laboratory tests performed only when the child's history and/or clinical examination revealed some abnormalities. The following data were collected: demographic data, ASA physical status classification, surgical procedure, anaesthetic technique, major and minor complications, length of hospital stay, the difference between the expected length of hospitalization and the actual length, number and reasons for cancellations of surgery. On the basis of our experience we believe that a thorough clinical assessment of the patient is more important than routine preoperative laboratory screening, which should be required only when justified by real clinical indications. Moreover, this practice eliminates unnecessary costs without compromising the safety and the quality of care.","Anaesthesia: evaluation; Preoperative","anesthesia; anesthesiological techniques; article; child; child hospitalization; controlled study; cost control; health care cost; health care quality; human; laboratory test; major clinical study; minor surgery; pediatric surgery; postoperative complication; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; surgical technique; Adolescent; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholinesterases; Creatine Kinase; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Hemoglobins; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Postoperative Complications; Urinalysis",,"Cholinesterases, EC 3.1.1.8; Creatine Kinase, EC 2.7.3.2; Hemoglobins",,,,"Guglielmi, M., Inutilità degli esami preoperatori di routine nel bambino sano (1988) Rass It Chir Ped, 30, pp. 24-26; Hannallah, R.S., Preoperative investigations (1995) Paediatr Anaesth, 5, pp. 325-329; Macpherson, D.S., Preoperative laboratory testing: Should any test be 'routine' before surgery?

The use of analgesic accelerates the onset of analgesia, inducing more elevated levels of analgesia especially after meperidine, but delays the onset of the motor blockade. The durantion of the sensitive and motor blockade with both treatments was shorter than that observed in the controls. Meperidine induces a higher incidence of side effects and a tendency to postoperative alteration of cardiocirculatory parameters.

Number of interventions and number of patients don't coincide since often the same patient has been assisted more times. The gathered data originate from the reporting of interventions filled by the SUEM medical staff and they include: date, time and place of the intervention, data of the patient, clinical conditions and their evolution after treatment, applied therapeutic measures, final destination of the patient, eventual refusal of the patient to the proposal of admission to the hospital. The SUEM medical staff did not follow a fixed protocol; however the treatments were substantially homogeneous and, in many cases, probably decisive. The greatest uncertains in the medical staff of SUEM, however, did not arise from medical problems: in fact, it emerges clearly that, in more than 40% of the cases, patients refused the admission to the hospital. The patients considered in this study are often able to oppose just because of an injection of naloxone and, as the effect of the antagonist subsides, might revert in the state of acute poisoning, constituting a risk for themselves and for other people. The two possible behaviours, that are to allow the patient to sign a form for the refusal of the admission or, if physician recognizes the state of necessity, to force the admission of the patient, are not exempt from possible legal consequences and, unfortunately, neither the doctrine neither the jurisprudence address this serious question.","Opiates; Overdose; Pre-hospital care","naloxone; narcotic agent; article; drug dependence; drug overdose; emergency medicine; hospital admission; human; medicolegal aspect; patient compliance",,"naloxone, 357-08-4, 465-65-6",,,,,"Ori, C.; Universita degli Studi di Padova, Istituto Anestesiologia Rianimazione, Padova, Italy",,,,,,,,03744965,,AANIB,,"Italian","ACTA ANAESTHESIOL.

Seventeen infants scheduled for lower limb orthopaedic surgery were studied to verify coexisting neuromuscular disorders with electromyography and muscle biopsy during surgery. All surgical procedures were performed under caudal block or spinal anaesthesia, associated with light general anaesthesia. No major cardiorespiratory, neurological or malignant hyperthermic complications (muscle rigidity, arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia) were observed. Combined neurological, electromyographic and biopsy studies showed a high rate of myopathic changes (70%). Performance of clubfoot surgery under light general anaesthesia with regional techniques was free from any problems. The high rate of myopathic changes (70%) observed in the muscle biopsies suggests that precautions should be taken with paediatric patients for clubfoot surgery and a regional anaesthesia technique with adequate monitoring may be helpful to prevent possible malignant hyperthermia related problems.",,"article; biopsy; clubfoot; electromyography; female; general anesthesia; heart arrhythmia; human; infant; male; malignant hyperthermia; muscle disease; muscle rigidity; myotonic dystrophy; nerve block; neuromuscular disease; pathology; pathophysiology; patient monitoring; preoperative care; prevalence; regional anesthesia; skeletal muscle; spinal anesthesia; Anesthesia, Conduction; Anesthesia, General; Anesthesia, Spinal; Arrhythmia; Biopsy; Clubfoot; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Malignant Hyperthermia; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Muscle Rigidity; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Diseases; Myotonic Dystrophy; Nerve Block; Neuromuscular Diseases; Preoperative Care; Prevalence",,,,,,,"Zanette, G.",,,,,,,,11555645,,,7489436,"English","Paediatr Anaesth",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029448169

The use of the Sprotte needle with a conical tip that spreads the dural fibers may reduce the incidence of PDPH. The aim of this study was to compare the 22-gauge and 25- gauge Sprotte needles with respect to PDPH and postoperative complaints in outpatients undergoing arthroscopy. The rate of spinal anesthesia failure and the feasibility of unilateral spinal anesthesia when using a low dose of anesthesia was also verified. For this randomized, prospective study, 234 patients undergoing elective arthroscopy were chosen. Patients were allocated randomly to have spinal anesthesia with either a 22-gauge or 25-gauge Sprotte needle. Dural puncture was performed with the patient in a lateral flexed decubitus position. After the injection of anesthetic solution (0.5-1.2 mL of 1% bupivacaine in 8% glucose) patients remained in the lateral decubitus position for 30 min. The time to regression of analgesia, time of micturition, and all postoperative complaints were recorded. The most frequent side effect was backache (10.2%) with a more frequent incidence in the group using the 22 gauge needle (14.5% and 5.9%, respectively). PDPH was recorded in only one patient (0.8%) in the group using the 22-gauge needle. The failure rate was 0.8%. Unilateral anesthesia was achieved in 88% of 213 patients. Our data indicate that the use of spinal block is a suitable technique in the ambulatory setting, with a low rate of unplanned hospital admission. The use of a Sprotte needle does not solve the PDPH problem; however, we confirm that the extremely low incidence and mild character of PDPH when Sprotte needles are used favors spinal anesthesia for outpatient surgery.",,"bupivacaine; adolescent; adult; aged; arthroscopic surgery; article; backache; female; headache; human; intrathecal drug administration; knee arthroscopy; knee surgery; major clinical study; male; needle; patient positioning; priority journal; spinal anesthesia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Anesthesia, Spinal; Arthroscopy; Back Pain; Bupivacaine; Comparative Study; Dura Mater; Equipment Design; Feasibility Studies; Female; Headache; Human; Incidence; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Age; Needles; Posture; Spinal Puncture",,"Bupivacaine, 2180-92-9",,,,,"Pittoni, G.; Anesthesiology/Intensive Care Dept., Anesthesiology/Intensive Care Inst., University of Padua, Via C.
