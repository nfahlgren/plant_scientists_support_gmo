One main factor determining the success of horizontal gene transfer is its tendency to recombine. This paper examines the safety implication of recent revelations on the recombination hotspot of the cauliflower mosaic viral (CaMV) promoter, which is in practically all current transgenic crops released commercially or undergoing field trials. As a precautionary measure, we strongly recommend that all transgenic crops containing CaMV 35S or similar promoters which are recombinogenic should be immediately withdrawn from commercial production or open field trials. All products derived from such crops containing transgenic DNA should also be immediately withdrawn from sale and from use for human consumption or animal feed. © Scandinavian University Press 1999.",,,,,,,,"Ho, M.W., Traavik, T., Olsvik, R., Tappeser, B., Howard, V., Von Weizsacker, C., McGavin, G., Gene Technology and Gene Ecology of Infectious Diseases (1998) Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease, 10, pp. 33-59; Traavik, T., (1999) Too Early May Be Too Late.

In some experiments long wavelength ultraviolet light was employed to convert the bromodeoxyuridine in DNA to its photoproduct. BrUrdR treatment produced a marked decrease in the mitotic index and a high proportion of the mitotic cells bore chromosome damage. Following a BrUrdR treatment of 5 hr the proportion of damaged cells increased from 20% to 60% during the 20 hr following treatment; then the proportion decreased sharply to less than 20%. Root tips treated as above followed by an exposure to long wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UV) had a proportion of damaged cells (80% at 20 hr) only slightly greater than those not exposed to UV up to 20 hr after treatment. Unlike the unirradiated BrUrdR substituted root tips, the proportion of damaged cells ramined high 25 hr after treatment. Furthermore, the spectrum of chromosome aberrations differed between irradiated and unirradiated BrUrdR substituted cells. Root tips exposed to long wavelength UV alone showed some damage that was limited to a stage in the cell cycle of irradiated root tips. Analysis of the BrUrdR treated corn DNA by cesium chloride density centrifugation showed that BrUrdR substitution for thymidine in DNA was extensive. Further experiments demonstrated that a large BrUrdR pool was not carried into the rounds of replication following BrUrdR removal from the medium. Nevertheless a small pool of halogenated pyrimidine was observable after BrUrdR removal from the medium.",,"broxuridine; floxuridine; radioisotope; broxuridine h 3; chromosome aberration; dna synthesis; in vitro study; plant; theoretical study; ultraviolet radiation; zea mays",,"broxuridine, 59-14-3; floxuridine, 50-91-9",,"amersham searle, United States",,,,,,,,,,,00084093,,CNJGA,,"English","CAN.

Low doses of ultraviolet light (u.v.) delay but do not prevent conjugation in wild type strains if given in the first 2-3 hr of mating. However, irradiation later than this period has little effect and conjugation proceeds normally. The u.v. effect is photoreactivable and it is concluded that u.v. induces dimers which affect transcription of specific messenger RNA molecules needed for conjugation ('sex message'). Evidence suggests that the dimers may cause mistranscription rather than the complete prevention of transcription. The effect of u.v. on conjugation in reciprocal crosses of u.v. sensitive and wild type strains indicates clearly that both partners must complete transcription of sex messages in order to conjugate. Inactivation of either partner before transcription prevents conjugation, but conjugation proceeds when either cell is inactivated after transcription of the sex messages has occurred. These results suggest that a mutual and reciprocal exchange of information between the 2 mating types occurs prior to the assembly of the conjugation tube.",,"rna; conjugation; dna transcription; fungus; genetic transcription; in vitro study; microorganism; rna translation; theoretical study; transcription; ultraviolet radiation; vitiligo; Alleles; Basidiomycota; Carbon Radioisotopes; Conjugation, Genetic; Kinetics; Radiation Effects; RNA; RNA, Messenger; Sex; Time Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Translation, Genetic; Ultraviolet Rays",,"RNA, 63231-63-0; Carbon Radioisotopes; RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA, Messenger",,,,,,,,,,,,,00219533,,JCLSB,4830830,"English","J.CELL SCI.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016371959

The DNA content of whole embryos and of single cells was investigated. The results are reported as follows: 1. 1. The growth of whole hybrid and parent embryos is described in terms of the number of genome equivalents (nuclei) per embryo as a function of time after fertilization. 2. 2. The relative DNA content per cell was estimated for hybrids and parents. The distribution of values for DNA per cell is presented as a function of the time after fertilization. Early developmental stages remain somewhat synchronous; later stages show increasingly larger proportions of the cell populations in the G0 or G1 stage of the cell cycle. 3. 3. There is no evidence for gross endopolyploidization or massive chromatin loss in most of the cells of both parents and their hybrids. The hybrids, however, show more evidence for limited heteroploidy than either parent. 4. 4.

The following cellular properties increased steadily and in proportion through the cycle: initial rate of uptake, rate of incorporation, size of the preexisting precursor pool and, with adenine, the size of the expanded pool. Similar patterns of incorporation and uptake were shown for guanine, cytosine, guanosine and cytidine. Both ribosomal RNA and rapidly labelled nuclear RNA were synthesised at an increasing rate through the cycle and followed an approximately exponential curve of synthesis. There was no indication of changes in the base ratios. The incorporation rates did not appear to be distorted by changes in uptake rate or pool size. The uptake and incorporation into step-down RNA was followed by autoradiography. It differed from the other two RNA's in showing a marked shift in the ratio of adenine/uracil incorporated at the end of the cycle. This is probably due to a change in the base composition of the RNA and not to changes in uptake rate or pool size. About half the step-down RNA was found in the cytoplasm after a short pulse label. © 1969.",,"carbon; nucleoside; RNA; tritium; uracil; article; Ascomycetes; autoradiography; biosynthesis; cell division; metabolism; time; Ascomycota; Autoradiography; Carbon Isotopes; Cell Division; Nucleosides; RNA; Time Factors; Tritium; Uracil",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; RNA, 63231-63-0; tritium, 10028-17-8; uracil, 66-22-8; Carbon Isotopes; Nucleosides; RNA, 63231-63-0; Tritium, 10028-17-8; Uracil, 66-22-8",,,,,"Mitchison, J.M.; Department of Zoology, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,00144827,,ECREA,5347640,"English","Exp.

The relative frequencies of dinucleotides, beginning with guanylic and cytidylic acids, increased during the cell cycle, whereas dinucleotides beginning with adenylic and uridylic acids decreased. Since dinucleotide frequencies are a measure of the RNA nucleotide sequence, there was a qualitative shift in DNA transcription from predominantly adenylic and thymidylic acid-rich DNA molecules or molecular regions to guanylic and cytidylic acid-rich DNA molecules or molecular regions as the cell cycle progressed. These nearest neighbor frequency analyses also showed that the RNA nucleotides were not randomly arranged in the polynucleotide chains and that only a limited portion of the total nuclear DNA was transcribed. These results suggest that DNA transcription follows an ordered temporal sequence during the cell cycle and also show that mitosis must provide a means of reinitiating DNA transcription at the starting point in a temporal cycle. © 1967.",,"DNA; guanine nucleotide; phosphorus; pyrimidine nucleotide; RNA; article; biosynthesis; cell nucleus; genetic code; metabolism; mitosis; molecular biology; Myxomycetes; Cell Nucleus; DNA; Genetic Code; Guanine Nucleotides; Mitosis; Molecular Biology; Myxomycetes; Phosphorus Isotopes; RNA; Uracil Nucleotides",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; RNA, 63231-63-0; DNA, 9007-49-2; Guanine Nucleotides; Phosphorus Isotopes; RNA, 63231-63-0; Uracil Nucleotides",,,,,"Cummins, J.E.; McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Medical Center University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States",,,,,,,,00052787,,,6069892,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014220282

Adenine was taken up from the medium at a rapid initial rate. The rate decayed to a constant value per unit mass 15-20 min after exposure of a culture to adenine. 2. 2. The final size of the intracellular pool of adenine metabolites appeared to be independent of the adenine level in the medium through a wide range of adenine levels. 3. 3. Adenine uptake was strongly dependent on glucose. 4. 4. The concentration-velocity response of adenine uptake followed simple enzyme kinetics. The observed Km was 0.33 μg/ml (2.45 × 10-6M). The observed V was 10-8 μg/min per cell. Several purine bases and ribonucleisides served as competitive inhibitors of adenine uptake. 5. 5. Prefilling with adenine resulted in a non-competitive inhibition of adenine uptake. Prefilling with several purine bases and ribonucleosides also resulted in a non-competitive inhibition of adenine uptake. 6. 6. Chromatography of the pool components labeled by adenine showed that AMP and inosine were labeled most rapidly under nornal conditions. Prefiling decreased the relative amount of label in inosine while pulse and chase experiments yielded relatively more label in inosine than AMP. The results of these experiments suggest that adenine uptake is mediated by a specific transport system and an accumulation of particular pool components may be important factors in regulating the flow of adenine into the cell. A scheme relating adenine influx, the purine pools and RNA synthesis is suggested. © 1967.",,"adenine; adenine nucleotide; carbon; nucleoside; RNA; article; Ascomycetes; biosynthesis; ion exchange chromatography; kinetics; metabolism; Adenine; Adenine Nucleotides; Ascomycota; Carbon Isotopes; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Kinetics; Nucleosides; RNA",,"adenine, 22177-51-1, 2922-28-3, 73-24-5; carbon, 7440-44-0; RNA, 63231-63-0; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenine, 73-24-5; Carbon Isotopes; Nucleosides; RNA, 63231-63-0",,,,,"Cummins, J.E.; Department of Zoology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,03044165,,BBGSB,6032031,"English","Biochim.

Both nucleate and anucleate half cells were capable of incorporating orthophosphate into RNA. The anucleate half cell, however, incorporated 32P at a slower rate than did the nucleate half cell and there was a diminution in the relative rate of 32P incorporation into the anucleate half cell with time after enucleation. Irrespective of the rate of 32P incorporation the distribution of 32P label among the nucleotides of RNA following alkaline degradation was not significantly different between the ribonucleotides in anucleate and nucleate half cells. Several methods of RNA preparation demonstrated that the orthophosphate incorporation was in fact attributable to a polyribonucleotide. It was further shown that the radioactivity was primarily associated with 2′,3′-nucleotides following alkaline degradation of the labelled RNA, ruling out the possibility of a nucleotide-binding phenomenon. Filtration experiments suggested that the labelled cytoplasmic RNA was not bound to stable particles of a diameter greater than 50 mμ. Finally the half cells were fractionated by centrifugation and the distribution of 32P in RNA of these fractions was analyzed. The fractionation experiments led us to conclude that RNA associated with the microsomes contains much of the label in nucleate and anucleate half cells. The RNA of the microsomes has similar distributions of 32P in both nucleate and anucleate half cells and these distributions were similar to the total half-cell distributions of 32P. The soluble fractions of both half cells had distinctly different distributions of 32P from the microsomal fractions and the soluble fractions of nucleate and anucleate half cells were different from each other. © 1964.",,,,,,,,,"Cummins, J.E.; Department of Zoology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States",,,,,,,,09266550,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-50549210583
