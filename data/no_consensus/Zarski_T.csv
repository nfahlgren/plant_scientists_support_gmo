The aim of the work was to analyze the mercury distribution in tissues and organs of wild birds. The following body organs were sampled: chest muscles, femoral muscles, heart muscle, bones, intestines, liver, kidney, lungs, gizzard, the mucosa of the stomach and brain. The content of mercury in the samples was determined by the method of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Based on the results and supported by the relevant literature, certain regularities emerged in the distribution of mercury in tissues and organs of wild birds. The organs with the highest accumulation of mercury were the kidney, liver, cardiac muscle and skeletal muscles. The smallest concentration of mercury appeared in the lungs, bones and the brain. The distribution of mercury depended on the tissue, indicating that the alimentary tract is the main gate through which mercury penetrated into birds’ organisms, in a way corresponding to their eating prefences. The highest concentrations of this element were ascertained in the little grebe feeding on aquatic organisms and small fish. The lowest concentrations of mercury appeared in town-dwelling pigeons. © 2015, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

Mercury content was investigated in particular tissues and organs of pike. Fishes bought at random in Warsaw fish wholesale company in November 2005 comprised the experimental material. Before sampling fishes were weighed and measured. The samples of the following tissues were collected for the investigations: scale, fins, liver, spleen, swim bladder, heart, frontal and dorsal kidney, spawn or milt, eyes, gills, skin, bones, brain and intestine. Mercury content in the collected samples was determined using the analyzer of mercury traces controlled by the computer programme AMA 254. A correlation between the level of mercury concentration and the age and body weight of fish was observed as a result of the performed investigations. The tissue which cumulates mercury to the highest degree is the muscle tissue, significant amounts of this element were also noted in the intestine and liver which proves that the main way of mercury entering the fish organism is the alimentary tract.","Mercury; Muscles; Pike","age; body size; correlation; fish; mercury (element); muscle; predator; sampling; software; Pisces",,,,,,"Banaszczyk, J., Heavy metals in the food (in Polish) (2002) Praca Magisterska SGGW, , Warszawa; Budzińska-Wrzesień, E., (1999) The Contamination the Mercury of Water Environt with the Regard of Moving This Element in the Trophic Chain (In Polish)., , Doctors thesis.

Alongside similarities production characteristics, in Poland and the Czech Republic there exist substantial differences. The aim of this study was to overview changes taking place in the meat and milk sectors of the Czech Republic. Despite the decreasing cattle population (including dairy cows), production in the Czech Republic is rather stable because of rising milk yield. During the last few years there has been a milk surplus on the market, even thought dairy exports dominate over import. A precondition of the realization of milk on the market is its high quality and this has become a basic prerequisite for profit and for the maintenance of the customer in the competitive market. An analysis has therefore been carried out of the economic indicators of the dynamics of milk yield, overall production and the quality indicators of milk, the bulk purchase and buying price of milk, during the years 1998 to 2004, including a survey of the costs, profits and the marketability of milk in the given years. In 2004, the milk purchase price, including compensation payment, ranged around 8 crowns (CZK) per litre. However, the production costs of milk sold increased to 8.42 crowns resulting in a lack of profitability. This was a result of an increasing growth rate in expenditure over milk yield. The level of expenditure and profits of the milk production of agricultural enterprises is going to be comparable with average results attained in EU-15. The static level of milk production is characteristic for all countries operating with a milk quota regime (EU-15, Norway, Switzerland and Canada). Individual reference quantities become a limiting factor for many producers. Based on EU data milk output is forecast to exceed national quota for 2005/6 in Czech and Poland, exposing both countries to hefty fines.","Czech Republic; Milk; Price","Bos",,,,,,"Bailey K.

Thus it is most probable that the element will be differently distributed and that the proportions between that element concentrations in particular organs at the time following intensive preying (autumn) and after winter limited food intake (spring) will vary. The present investigation aimed at confirming the above hypothesis. The investigations were performed on 20 breams fished in October and May of the following year. The contents of mercury in the muscles, hepato-pancreas, kidney, gills and intestine was determined by the ASA method. It has been demonstrated that seasons did not significantly affect the concentration of mercury in the tissues and organs of bream. In the autumn season, following intensive preying the Hg metabolism is more dynamic than in spring.
