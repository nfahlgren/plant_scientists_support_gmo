Nearly 500 pesticide poisonings were reported for California farmworkers every year from 1997 to 2000. The actual number of pesticide-related illnesses is unknown, since many poisonings go unreported. Most poisonings occurred as a result of soil fumigation and pesticide applications to grapes, oranges, and cotton. Pesticide drift accounted for 51% of the cases, and another 25% resulted from exposures to pesticide residues. Violations of worker safety laws were common, contributing to 41% of reported poisonings. No violations occurred in another 38%, indicating that existing laws inadequately protect workers from pesticide exposure. This snapshot of human rights abuse through pesticide exposure in California - the site of some of the world's most stringent pesticide use and worker safety laws - illustrates the global problem of pesticide poisoning among agricultural workers.","Agricultural poisonings; Farmworkers; Human rights; Pesticides; Worker safety laws","pesticide; agricultural worker; agriculture; article; cotton; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; grape; human; human rights; intoxication; law; occupational safety; orange (fruit); organization; policy; priority journal; risk assessment; soil fumigation; United States; Adult; Agricultural Workers' Diseases; Agriculture; California; Child; Human Rights; Humans; Law Enforcement; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Pesticides; Population Surveillance; Risk; Social Justice; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",,"Pesticides",,,,"(1996) Accident Facts, , Itasca, IL: National Safety Council; Reeves, M., Schafer, K., Hallward, K., Katten, A., (1999) Fields of Poison: California Farmworkers and Pesticides, , Pesticide Action Network, San Francisco, CA; (1993) Pesticides on Farms: Limited Capability Exists to Monitor Occupational Illnesses and Injuries, , (GAO/PEMD-94-6).
