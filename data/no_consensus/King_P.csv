Developed in 1927, it has been and is still being used as a preservative in some cosmetics, topical pharmaceuticals, and biological drug products, including vaccines. Concerns have been voiced about its use because it is toxic to human cells. Although it is banned in several countries, it continues to be added to some vaccines in the United States and many vaccines in the developing world. Discussion: This critical review focuses on the clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical studies of adverse effects from Thimerosal in developing humans. This review will include research that examines fetal, infant, and childhood death; birth defects; neurodevelopmental testing deficits in children; and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, tic disorder, and specific developmental delays). The review will also look at the research that examined the outcomes of acute accidental ethyl-Hg poisoning in humans. The studies that examine the underlying biochemical insights into the neuronal cellular damage will also be explored. Conclusion: The culmination of the research that examines the effects of Thimerosal in humans indicates that it is a poison at minute levels with a plethora of deleterious consequences, even at the levels currently administered in vaccines. © 2015 .","Ethylmercury; Humans; Neurodevelopment; Thimerosal","chloramphenicol; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; ethylmercury derivative; fungicide; hepatitis B vaccine; influenza vaccine; Meningococcus vaccine; methylmercury; rhesus D antibody; tetanus toxoid; thiomersal; attention deficit disorder; autism; birth defect; child death; developing country; developmental disorder; fetus death; fetus wastage; human; influenza vaccination; learning disorder; maximum permissible dose; mercurialism; nerve cell lesion; neurotoxicity; perinatal drug exposure; pregnant woman; prenatal drug exposure; prevalence; priority journal; Review; tic; toxicokinetics",,"chloramphenicol, 134-90-7, 2787-09-9, 56-75-7; methylmercury, 16056-34-1, 593-74-8; tetanus toxoid, 57425-69-1, 93384-51-1; thiomersal, 54-64-8","fluzone, Sanofi Pasteur",,,"Tan, M., Parkin, J.E., Route of decomposition of thiomersal (thimerosal) (2000) Int J Pharm, 208 (1-2), pp. 23-34; Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., Geier, M.R., A review of Thimerosal (Merthiolate) and its ethylmercury breakdown product: specific historical considerations regarding safety and effectiveness (2007) J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev, 10 (8), pp. 575-596; Morton, H.E., North, L.L., Engley, J.B., The bacteriostatic actions of some mercurial compounds on hemolytic streptococci (1948) J Am Med Assoc, 136 (1), pp. 37-41; Mercurials as ""preservatives"" (1948) J Am Med Assoc, 122 (8), p. 1253. , Anonymous; Stetler, H.C., Garbe, P.L., Dwyer, D.M., Outbreaks of group A streptococcal abscesses following diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis vaccination (1985) Pediatrics, 72 (2), pp. 299-303; Khandke, L., Yang, C., Krylova, K., Jansen, K.U., Rashidbaigi, A., Preservative of choice for Prev(e)nar 13™ in a multi-dose formulation (2011) Vaccine, 29 (41), pp. 7144-7153; Geier, D.A., Jordan, S.K., Geier, M.R., The relative toxicity of compounds used as preservatives in vaccines and biologics (2010) Med Sci Monit, 16 (5), pp. SR21-SR27; Kern, J.K., Geier, D.A., Ayzac, F., Adams, J.B., Mehta, J.A., Geier, M.R., Toxicity biomarkers among US children compared to a similar cohort in France: a blinded study measuring urinary porphyrins (2011) Toxicol Environ Chem, 93 (1-2), pp. 396-405; Bigham, M., Copes, R., Thiomersal in vaccines: balancing the risk of adverse effects with the risk of vaccine-preventable disease (2005) Drug Saf, 28 (2), pp. 89-101; Kern, J.K., Haley, B.E., Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., King, P.G., Geier, M.R., Thimerosal exposure and the role of sulfation chemistry and thiol availability in autism (2013) Int J Environ Res Public Health, 10 (8), pp. 3771-3800; Studies that show harm from Thimerosal, , http://mercury-freedrugs.org/docs/20141212_KernJK_ExcelFile_TMs_Harm_Refs_%20v43_secure.xlsx, [Updated 12/12/2014.

Automated medical records were examined to identify cases and controls enrolled from their date-of-birth (1991–2000) in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project. ND cases were diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), specific developmental delay, tic disorder or hyperkinetic syndrome of childhood. In addition, putative non-thimerosal-related outcomes of febrile seizure, failure to thrive and cerebral degenerations were examined. The cumulative total dose of Hg exposure from thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine (T-HBV) administered within the first six months of life was calculated. On a per microgram of organic-Hg basis, PDD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.054), specific developmental delay (OR = 1.035), tic disorder (OR = 1.034) and hyperkinetic syndrome of childhood (OR = 1.05) cases were significantly more likely than controls to receive increased organic-Hg exposure. By contrast, none of the non-thimerosal related outcomes were significantly more likely than the controls to have received increased organic-Hg exposure. Routine childhood vaccination may be an important public health tool to reduce infectious disease-associated morbidity/mortality, but the present study significantly associates organic-Hg exposure from T-HBV with an increased risk of an ND diagnosis. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Attention deficit; Autism; Ethylmercury; Merthiolate; Thiomersal","Haemophilus influenzae type b hepatitis B vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; organomercury compound; thiomersal; hepatitis B vaccine; preservative; thiomersal; dose-response relationship; health risk; mental health; mercury (element); toxicity; vaccine; Article; autism; brain degeneration; case control study; child; controlled study; developmental disorder; dose response; failure to thrive; febrile convulsion; female; human; hyperkinesia; major clinical study; male; neurodevelopmental disorder; neurologic disease; perinatal drug exposure; risk assessment; risk factor; tic; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; chemically induced; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Developmental Disabilities; dose response; infant; preschool child; Tic Disorders; United States; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Humans; Infant; Male; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical; Thimerosal; Tic Disorders; United States",,"thiomersal, 54-64-8; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical; Thimerosal",,,,"Kern, J.K., Haley, B.E., Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., King, P.G., Geier, M.R., Thimerosal exposure and the role of sulfation chemistry and thiol availability in autism (2013) Int.

Two key studies known as the Children's Amalgam Trials are widely cited as evidence of safety. However, four recent reanalyses of one of these trials now suggest harm, particularly to boys with common genetic variants. These and other studies suggest that susceptibility to mercury toxicity differs among individuals based on multiple genes, not all of which have been identified. These studies further suggest that the levels of exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams may be unsafe for certain subpopulations. Moreover, a simple comparison of typical exposures versus regulatory safety standards suggests that many people receive unsafe exposures. Chronic mercury toxicity is especially insidious because symptoms are variable and nonspecific, diagnostic tests are often misunderstood, and treatments are speculative at best. Throughout the world, efforts are underway to phase down or eliminate the use of mercury dental amalgam. © 2014 The Author(s).","Chronic mercury toxicity; Dental amalgam; Mercury; Porphyrins","amalgam; mercury; chemistry; child; chronic disease; health care policy; human; Mercury Poisoning; patient safety; standards; toxicity; Child; Chronic Disease; Dental Amalgam; Health Policy; Humans; Mercury; Mercury Poisoning; Patient Safety",,"mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; Dental Amalgam; Mercury",,,,"(2013) Statement on Dental Amalgam, , http://www.ada.org/1741.aspx, ADA (American Dental Association) Accessed 26 Dec 2013; (1999) Toxicological Profile for Mercury, , ATSDR (US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry) Public Health Service US Department of Health and Human Services; Bailey, A.B., Hoekstra, E.J., (2010) Background Paper on Sources and Occurrence of Bisphenol A Relevant for Exposure of Consumers, , Paper presented at the expert meeting on Bisphenol A (BPA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization, Ottawa, 2-5 Nov; Barcelos, G.R., Grotto, D., De Marco, K.C., Valentini, J., Lengert, A.V., Oliveira, A.A., Garcia, S.C., Polymorphisms in glutathione-related genes modify mercury concentrations and antioxidant status in subjects environmentally exposed to methylmercury (2013) Sci Total Environ, 463-464, pp. 319-325. , 23827356 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.06.029; Bellinger, D.C., Trachtenberg, F., Barregard, L., Tavares, M., Cernichiari, E., Daniel, D., McKinlay, S., Neuropsychological and renal effects of dental amalgam in children: A randomized clinical trial (2006) JAMA, 295 (15), pp. 1775-1783. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28Xjs12ntrY%3D 16622139 10.1001/jama.295.15.1775; Berlin, M., Zalups, R.K., Fowler, B.A., Mercury (2007) Handbook on the Toxicology of Metals, , G.

Of these, 16 were conducted to specifically examine the effects of Thimerosal on human infants or children with reported outcomes of death; acrodynia; poisoning; allergic reaction; malformations; auto-immune reaction; Well's syndrome; developmental delay; and neurodevelopmental disorders, including tics, speech delay, language delay, attention deficit disorder, and autism. In contrast, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that Thimerosal is safe and there is ""no relationship between [T]himerosal[-]containing vaccines and autism rates in children."" This is puzzling because, in a study conducted directly by CDC epidemiologists, a 7.6-fold increased risk of autism from exposure to Thimerosal during infancy was found. The CDC's current stance that Thimerosal is safe and that there is no relationship between Thimerosal and autism is based on six specific published epidemiological studies coauthored and sponsored by the CDC. The purpose of this review is to examine these six publications and analyze possible reasons why their published outcomes are so different from the results of investigations by multiple independent research groups over the past 75+ years. © 2014 Brian Hooker et al.",,"thiomersal;

A significant number of children diagnosed with ASD suffer a loss of previously-acquired skills, which is suggestive of neurodegeneration or a type of progressive encephalopathy with an etiological pathogenic basis occurring after birth. To date, the etiology of ASD remains under debate, however, many studies suggest toxicity, especially from mercury (Hg), in individuals diagnosed with an ASD. The present study evaluated concerns about the toxic effects of organic-Hg exposure from Thimerosal (49.55% Hg by weight) in childhood vaccines by conducting a two-phased (hypothesis generating/hypothesis testing) study with documented exposure to varying levels of Thimerosal from vaccinations.Methods: A hypothesis generating cohort study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between exposure to organic-Hg from a Thimerosal-containing Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular-Pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in comparison to a Thimerosal-free DTaP vaccine administered, from 1998 through 2000, for the risk of ASD as reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database (phase I). A hypothesis testing case-control study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between organic-Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines administered at specific intervals in the first six months of life among cases diagnosed with an ASD and controls born between 1991 through 1999 in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database (phase II).Results: In phase I, it was observed that there was a significantly increased risk ratio for the incidence of ASD reported following the Thimerosal-containing DTaP vaccine in comparison to the Thimerosal-free DTaP vaccine. In phase II, it was observed that cases diagnosed with an ASD were significantly more likely than controls to receive increased organic-Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine administered within the first, second, and sixth month of life.Conclusions: Routine childhood vaccination is an important public health tool to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases, but the present study provides new epidemiological evidence supporting an association between increasing organic-Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines and the subsequent risk of an ASD diagnosis. © 2013 Geier et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Autism; Ethylmercury; Merthiolate; Thimerosal; Thiomersal; Vaccine","diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; thiomersal; active immunization; article; autism; case control study; controlled study; diphtheria; drug safety; hepatitis B; human; major clinical study; pertussis; priority journal; risk assessment; tetanus; United States",,"thiomersal, 54-64-8","acel immune, Pfizer; acel immune, Wyeth Lederle; infanrix, Glaxo SmithKline","Glaxo SmithKline; Pfizer; Wyeth Lederle",,"Boyle, C.A., Boulet, S., Schieve, L.A., Cohen, R.A., Blumberg, S.J., Yeargin-Allsopp, M., Visser, S., Kogan, M.D., Trends in the prevalence of developmental disabilities in US children, 1997-2008 (2011) Pediatrics, 127, pp. 1034-1042. , 10.1542/peds.2010-2989, 21606152; Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders-Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 sites, United States, 2008 (2012) MMWR Surveill Summ, 61, pp. 1-19. , Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2008 Principal Investigators; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Geier, D.A., Kern, J.K., Geier, M.R., A comparison of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) for the quantitative evaluation of autism (2013) J Ment Health Res Intellect Disabil, 6, pp. 255-267. , 10.1080/19315864.2012.681340, 3725669, 23914277; Geier, D.A., Kern, J.K., Geier, M.R., A prospective cross-sectional cohort assessment of health, physical, and behavioral problems in autism spectrum disorders (2012) Maedica (Buchar), 7, pp. 193-200. , 3566881, 23400046; Kern, J.K., Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., Geier, M.R., Evidence of neurodegeneration in autism spectrum disorder (2013) Transl Neurodegener, 2, p. 17. , 10.1186/2047-9158-2-17, 3751488, 23925007; Desoto, M.C., Hitlan, R.T., Sorting out the spinning of autism: heavy metals and the question of incidence (2010) Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars), 70, pp. 165-176; Kern, J.K., Geier, D.A., Audhya, T., King, P.G., Sykes, L.K., Geier, M.R., Evidence of parallels between mercury intoxication and the brain pathology in autism (2012) Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars), 72, pp. 113-153; Geier, D.A., King, P.G., Sykes, L.K., Geier, M.R., A comprehensive review of mercury provoked autism (2008) Indian J Med Res, 128, pp. 383-411; Kern, J.K., Haley, B.E., Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., King, P.G., Geier, M.R., Thimerosal exposure and the role of sulfation chemistry and thiol availability in autism (2013) Int J Environ Res Public Health, 10, pp. 3771-3800. , 10.3390/ijerph10083771, 3774468, 23965928; Ball, L.K., Ball, R., Pratt, R.D., An assessment of Thimerosal use in childhood vaccines (2001) Pediatrics, 107, pp. 1147-1154. , 10.1542/peds.107.5.1147, 11331700; Singleton, J.A., Lloyd, J.C., Mootrey, G.T., Salive, M.E., Chen, R.T., An overview of the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) as a surveillance system (1999) VAERS Working Group.

Thirty-three children, aged 2-17 years, with an ASD and 33 gender-, race-, and age-matched neurotypical controls were tested using a handgrip dynamometer. The handgrip strength in participants with an ASD was significantly (p < 0.0001) lower than the neurotypical controls. The mean handgrip strength was 39.4 6 17.7 kPa in children with ASD and 65.1 ± 26.7 kPa in controls. The results support the hypothesis that children with an ASD have significantly poorer handgrip strength as compared with neurotypical children. Because the handheld dynamometer has been shown to be a valid tool for measuring overall muscle strength, the results suggest that children with ASD have muscle weakness. Future studies are needed to determine the extent of muscle weakness in ASD, its ramifications, and the possible benefits of muscle strengthening. The present study provides support for the use of handgrip strength as a tool for the assessment of targeted treatment in ASD. © 2013 National Strength and Conditioning Association.","Handgrip dynamometer; Muscle strength; Physical condition","adolescent; article; autism; case control study; child; dynamometer; female; fitness; hand strength; human; male; muscle weakness; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Child, Preschool; Female; Hand Strength; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength Dynamometer; Muscle Weakness; Physical Fitness",,,,,,"(2000) Diagnostic Criteria for Autistic Disorder, , American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.).

Typically reported are losses of verbal, nonverbal, and social abilities. Several recent studies suggest that children diagnosed with an ASD have abnormal sulfation chemistry, limited thiol availability, and decreased glutathione (GSH) reserve capacity, resulting in a compromised oxidation/reduction (redox) and detoxification capacity. Research indicates that the availability of thiols, particularly GSH, can influence the effects of thimerosal (TM) and other mercury (Hg) compounds. TM is an organomercurial compound (49.55% Hg by weight) that has been, and continues to be, used as a preservative in many childhood vaccines, particularly in developing countries. Thiol-modulating mechanisms affecting the cytotoxicity of TM have been identified. Importantly, the emergence of ASD symptoms post-6 months of age temporally follows the administration of many childhood vaccines. The purpose of the present critical review is provide mechanistic insight regarding how limited thiol availability, abnormal sulfation chemistry, and decreased GSH reserve capacity in children with an ASD could make them more susceptible to the toxic effects of TM routinely administered as part of mandated childhood immunization schedules.",,"glutathione; mercury; preservative; thiol derivative; thiomersal; vaccine; glutathione; thiol derivative; thiomersal; animal; autism; child; human; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; review; risk factor; vaccination; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; metabolism; Animals; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Glutathione; Humans; Mercury; Oxidation-Reduction; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical; Risk Factors; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Thimerosal; Vaccination; Vaccines; Animals; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Glutathione; Humans; Mercury; Oxidation-Reduction; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical; Risk Factors; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Thimerosal; Vaccination; Vaccines",,"glutathione, 70-18-8; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; thiol derivative, 13940-21-1; thiomersal, 54-64-8; Glutathione, GAN16C9B8O; Mercury, FXS1BY2PGL; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Thimerosal, 2225PI3MOV; Vaccines; Glutathione; Mercury; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Thimerosal; Vaccines",,,,,"Kern, J.K.email: jKern@dfwair.net",,,,,,,,16604601,,,23965928,"English","Int J Environ Res Public Health",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891516098

Amalgams are about 50% mercury (Hg), and Hg is known to significantly accumulate in the kidney. It was hypothesized that because Hg accumulates in the proximal tubules (PTs), glutathione-S-transferases (GST)-α (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of PT) would be expected to be more related to Hg exposure than GST-π (suggestive of kidney damage at the level of the distal tubules). Urinary biomarkers of kidney integrity were examined in children of 8-18 years old, with and without dental amalgam fillings, from a completed clinical trial (parent study). Our study determined whether there was a significant dose-dependent correlation between increasing Hg exposure from dental amalgams and GST-α and GST-π as biomarkers of kidney integrity. Overall, the present study, using a different and more sensitive statistical model than the parent study, revealed a statistically significant dose-dependent correlation between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary levels of GST-α, after covariate adjustment; where as, a nonsignificant relationship was observed with urinary levels of GST-π. Furthermore, it was observed that urinary GST-α levels increased by about 10% over the 8-year course of the study among individuals with an average exposure to amalgams among the study subjects from the amalgam group, in comparison with study subjects with no exposure to dental amalgams. The results of our study suggest that dental amalgams contribute to ongoing kidney damage at the level of the PTs in a dose-dependent fashion. © The Author(s) 2013.","Biomarker; dental amalgam; glutathione; kidney; mercury","amalgam; glutathione transferase alpha; glutathione transferase P1; mercury; adolescent; adult; article; child; clinical article; clinical trial (topic); controlled study; correlation analysis; dose response; exposure; exposure variable; female; human; kidney function; male; preschool child; priority journal; protein urine level; school child; statistical model; tooth filling; urinalysis; Adolescent; Biological Markers; Child; Dental Amalgam; Female; Glutathione S-Transferase pi; Glutathione Transferase; Humans; Isoenzymes; Kidney; Male; Mercury; Portugal",,"mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; Biological Markers; Dental Amalgam, 8049-85-2; Glutathione S-Transferase pi, 2.5.1.18; Glutathione Transferase, 2.5.1.18; Isoenzymes; Mercury, 7439-97-6; glutathione S-transferase alpha, 2.5.1.18",,,,"Geier, D.A., Carmody, T., Kern, J.K., King, P.G., Geier, M.R., A significant relationship between mercury exposure from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins: A further assessment of the casa pia children's dental amalgam trial (2011) Biometals, 24, pp. 215-224; Geier, D., Carmody, T., Kern, J.K., King, P.G., Geier, M.R., A dose-dependent relationship between mercury exposure from dental amalgams and urinary mercury levels: A further assessment of the casa pia children's dental amalgam trial (2012) Hum Exp Toxicol, 31, pp. 11-17; Lash, L.H., Putt, D.A., Zalups, R.K., Role of extracellular thiols in accumulation and distribution of inorganic mercury in rat renal proximal and distal tubular cells (1998) J Pharmacol Exp Therapeut, 285, pp. 1039-1050; Zalups, R.K., Autometallographic localization of inorganic mercury in the kidneys of rats: Effect of unilateral nephrectomy and compensatory renal growth (1991) Exp Mol Pathol, 54, pp. 10-21; Stacchiotti, A., Lavazza, A., Rezzani, R., Borsani, E., Rodella, L., Bianchi, R., Mercuric chloride-induced alterations in stress protein distribution in rat kidney (2004) Histol Histopathol, 19, pp. 1209-1218; Diamond, G.L., Zalups, R.K., Understanding renal toxicity of heavy metals (1998) Toxicol Pathol, 26, pp. 92-103; Woods, J.S., Martin, M.D., Leroux, B.G., Biomarkers of kidney integrity in children and adolescents with dental amalgam mercury exposure: Findings from the casa pia children's amalgam trial (2008) Environ Res, 108, pp. 393-399; Sundberg, A.G., Appelkvist, E.L., Backman, L., Dallner, G., Quantitation of glutathione transferase-pi in the urine by radioimmunoassay (1994) Nephron, 66, pp. 162-169; Backman, L., Appelkvist, E.L., Ringden, O., Dallner, G., Glutathione transferase in the urine: A marker for post-transplant tubular lesions (1988) Kidney Int, 33, pp. 571-577; Sundberg, A.G., Appelkvist, E.L., Backman, L., Dallner, G., Urinary pi-class glutathione transferase as an indicator of tubular damage in the human kidney (1994) Nephron, 67, pp. 308-316; Backman, L., Appelkvist, E.L., Ringden, O., Dallner, G., Urinary levels of basic glutathione transferase as an indicator of proximal tubular damage in renal transplant recipients (1989) Transplant Proc, 21, pp. 1514-1516; Derouen, T.A., Leroux, B.G., Martin, M.D., Issues in design and analysis of a randomized clinical trial to assess the safety of dental amalgam restorations in children (2002) Contr Clin Trials, 23, pp. 301-320; Mortada, W.L., Sobh, M.A., El-Defrawy, M.M., Farahat, S.E., Mercury in dental restoration: Is there a risk of nephrotoxicity?

Moreover, Hg body-burden was associated with ASD severity. This cross-sectional study examined the potential correlation between hair toxic metal concentrations and ASD severity in a prospective cohort of participants diagnosed with moderate to severe ASD. The Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (Dallas, TX) approved the present study. Qualifying study participants (n = 18) were evaluated for ASD severity using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and quantitatively for arsenic, Hg, cadmium, lead, chromium, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, tin, uranium, and manganese using hair toxic element testing by Doctor's Data (a CLIA-approved laboratory). CARS scoring and hair toxic element testing were blinded to one another. Increasing hair Hg concentrations significantly correlated with increased ASD severity. In contrast, no significant correlations were observed between any other of the hair toxic metals examined and ASD severity. This study helps to provide additional mechanistic support for Hg in the etiology of ASD severity, and is supported by an increasing number of recent critical reviews that provide biological plausibility for the role of Hg exposure in the pathogenesis of ASDs. © 2012 by the authors.","Asperger; Autism; Autistic; Developmental; Hair; Heavy metal; Neurodevelopmental; Neurotoxicity; PDD-NOS","aluminum; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; lead; manganese; mercury; metal; nickel; tin; uranium; arsenic; cadmium; concentration (composition); correlation; disability; hair; heavy metal; mental health; mercury (element); pathogenicity; quantitative analysis; toxicity test; autism; chemical analysis; child; Childhood Autism Rating Scale; clinical article; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease severity; environmental exposure; female; hair level; heavy metal poisoning; human; male; pathogenesis; preschool child; psychologic assessment; quantitative study; rating scale; review; scoring system; single blind procedure; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hair; Humans; Infant; Male; Mercury; Metals, Heavy; Prospective Studies; Texas; Dallas; Texas; United States",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; arsenic, 7440-38-2; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; chromium, 14092-98-9, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3; cobalt, 7440-48-4; lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; nickel, 7440-02-0; tin, 14314-35-3, 7440-31-5; uranium, 7440-61-1; Mercury, 7439-97-6; Metals, Heavy",,,,"Desoto, M.C., Hitlan, R.T., Sorting out the spinning of autism: Heavy metals and the question of incidence (2010) Acta Neurobiol.

This review finds evidence of many parallels between the two, including: (1) microtubule degeneration, specifically large, long-range axon degeneration with subsequent abortive axonal sprouting (short, thin axons); (2) dentritic overgrowth; (3) neuroinflammation; (4) microglial/astrocytic activation; (5) brain immune response activation; (6) elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein; (7) oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation; (8) decreased reduced glutathione levels and elevated oxidized glutathione; (9) mitochondrial dysfunction; (10) disruption in calcium homeostasis and signaling; (11) inhibition of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity; (12) disruption of GABAergic and glutamatergic homeostasis; (13) inhibition of IGF-1 and methionine synthase activity; (14) impairment in methylation; (15) vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and pathological changes of the blood vessels; (16) decreased cerebral/cerebellar blood flow; (17) increased amyloid precursor protein; (18) loss of granule and Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum; (19) increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the brain (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-8); and (20) aberrant nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). This review also discusses the ability of mercury to potentiate and work synergistically with other toxins and pathogens in a way that may contribute to the brain pathology in ASD. The evidence suggests that mercury may be either causal or contributory in the brain pathology in ASD, possibly working synergistically with other toxic compounds or pathogens to produce the brain pathology observed in those diagnosed with an ASD. © 2012 by Polish Neuroscience Society - PTBUN, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology.","Autism;

Subjects diagnosed with an ASD have a male:female ratio of 4:1, and among subjects diagnosed with AS the male:female ratio is as high as 9:1. The purpose of this study was to examine evidence of the association between hyperandrogenism and autistic traits (ATs) among subjects diagnosed with an ASD, and to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-androgen therapy as a means to help treat ATs in subjects diagnosed with an ASD. Evidence of hyperandrogenism in subjects diagnosed with an ASD is supported by multiple studies in the areas of psychological framework, brain pathology, tissue culture, and pre- and postnatal androgen levels. Data from subjects diagnosed with other conditions associated with elevated androgens reveals many of these individuals have ATs. Finally, in a placebo-controlled trial of testosterone administration to neurotypical subjects, testosterone was found to increase ATs. In addition, a controlled trial of human transsexuals revealed a significant increase in ATs in female-to-male transsexuals and a decrease in ATs in male-to-female transsexuals. Data from multiple animals and human clinical trials suggest that antiandrogen medications have the ability to significantly reduce ATs in patients diagnosed with an ASD. In light of the robust association between hyperandrogenism and ASD, it is recommended subjects diagnosed with an ASD should undergo routine screening for elevated androgens, and appropriate treatment should be initiated for those with elevated androgens. © 2012 by Polish Neuroscience Society - PTBUN, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology.","Autistic disorder; Cyproterone acetate; Leuprolide acetate; Testosterone","androgen; antiandrogen; testosterone; animal; autism; child; clinical trial (topic); drug antagonism; female; human; male; metabolism; review; sexual development; Androgen Antagonists; Androgens; Animals; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Clinical Trials as Topic; Female; Humans; Male; Sex Characteristics; Testosterone",,"testosterone, 58-22-0; Androgen Antagonists; Androgens; Testosterone, 58-22-0",,,,"Diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, p. 75. , American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition-text Revision (DSMIV-TR) American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Auyeung, B., Baron-Cohen, S., Chapman, E., Knickmeyer, R.C., Taylor, K., Hackett, G., Foetal testosterone and the child systemizing quotient (2006) Eur J Endocrinol, 155, pp. S123-S130; Auyeung, B., Baron-Cohen, S., Ashwin, E., Knickmeyer, R., Taylor, K., Hackett, G., Fetal Testosterone and Autistic Traits (2009) Br J Psychol, 100, pp. 1-22; Auyeung, B., Taylor, K., Hackett, G., Baron-Cohen, S., Foetal testosterone and autistic traits in 18 to 24-month-old children (2010) Mol Autism, 1, p. 11; Baron-Cohen, S., The extreme male brain theory of autism (2002) Trends Cogn Sci, 6, pp. 248-254; Benson, R.C., Total androgen blockade: The United States experience (1993) Eur Urol, 24 (SUPPL. 2), pp. 72-76; Berenbaum, S.A., Resnick, S.M., Early androgen effects on aggression in children and adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (1997) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 22, pp. 505-515; Bertelloni, S., Mul, D., Treatment of central precocious puberty by GnRH analogs: Long-term outcome in men (2008) Asian J Androl, 10, pp. 525-534; Bryan, K.J., Mudd, J.C., Richardson, S.L., Chang, J., Lee, H.G., Zhu, X., Smith, M.A., Casadesus, G., Down-regulation of serum gonadotropins is as effective as estrogen replacement at improving menopause-associated cognitive deficits (2010) J Neurchem, 112, pp. 870-881; Caparros-Lefebvre, D., Dewailly, D., Preliminary pilot study of cyproterone acetate for the treatment of aggressive behavior associated with severe dementia (2005) Rev Neurol (Pars), 161, pp. 1071-1078; Carel, J.C., Eugster, E.A., Rogol, A., Ghizzoni, L., Palmert, M.R., Consensus statement on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs in children (2009) Pediatrics, 123, pp. e752-e62. , ESPE-LWPES GnRH Analogs Consensus Conference Group; Chapman, E., Baron-Cohen, S., Auyeung, B., Knickmeyer, R., Taylor, K., Hackett, G., Fetal testosterone and empathy: Evidence from the empathy quotient (EQ) and the 'Reading the mind in the eyes' test (2006) Soc Neurosci, 1, pp. 135-148; Cohen-Bendahan, C.C., van de Beek, C., Berenbaum, S.A., Prenatal sex hormone effects on child and adult sex-typed behavior: Methods and findings (2005) Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 29, pp. 353-384; Collaer, M.L., Hines, M., Human behavioral sex differences: A role for gonadal hormones during early development?

The hypothesis tested in the present study is that rotavirus vaccines are associated with an increased risk of intussusception adverse events (AEs) characterized by an onset in a biologically plausible a priori identified temporal period post-vaccination (days 3 to 7). Material/Methods: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) updated as of December 28, 2010 was analyzed. Results: Following RotaTeq vaccination, a significantly (p<0.001) higher percentage of AEs were classified as serious, permanently disabling, resulted in hospitalizations, or were life-threatening among intussusception AEs in comparison to the total AE reports (removing intussusception AE reports) submitted to VAERS. A significantly greater portion of intussusception AEs in comparison to the portion of total AE reports (removing intussusception AE reports) were reported to VAERS in the onset interval from 3 to 7 days post-RotaTeq vaccination than within the onset interval from 1 to 2 days post-RotaTeq vaccination (78.7% vs. 29.1%, risk ratio=2.7, 95% CI=2.4-3.0, p<0.0001). It was assumed in our onset time-trend analyses of the distribution of AEs following Rota-Teq vaccination that the AE's should be equally likely to be reported with an onset time for each day, from 1 to 9 days post-vaccination or, alternatively, should follow similar daily proportions as observed for total AEs reports (removing intussusception AE reports). Results of this onset time-trend analyses of the distribution of intussusception AEs reported to VAERS following Rota-Teq vaccination revealed significant differences (p<0.001) from our expectations. Consistent and similarly remarkable trends were observed for intussusception AE reports associated with RotaShield vaccine. Conclusions: The present study significantly associates RotaTeq vaccination with intussusception AEs. © Med Sci Monit, 2012.","Intussusception; Post-marketing surveillance; Rotavirus; Timing; Vaccine","Rotavirus vaccine; article; disability; drug monitoring; drug safety; drug surveillance program; female; hospitalization; human; immunization; intussusception; major clinical study; male; permanent disability; treatment outcome; Humans; Infant; Intussusception; Rotavirus Vaccines; United States; Vaccines, Attenuated",,"RotaTeq; Rotavirus Vaccines; Vaccines, Attenuated",,,,"Prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis among infants and children.

In our study, urinary Hg levels was examined in children of age 8-18 years, with and without dental amalgam fillings, from a completed clinical trial (parent study) that was designed to evaluate the potential health consequences of prolonged exposure to Hg from dental amalgam fillings. Our study was designed to determine whether there was a significant dose-dependent correlation between increasing Hg exposure from dental amalgams and urinary Hg levels. Hg exposure depends on the size and number of teeth with dental amalgams. Overall, consistent with the results observed in the parent study, there was a statistically significant dose-dependent correlation between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary Hg levels, after covariate adjustment. Further, it was observed that urinary Hg levels increased by 18% to 52% among 8 to 18 year old individuals, respectively, with an average exposure to amalgams, in comparison to study subjects with no exposure to amalgams. The results of our study suggest that dental amalgams contribute to ongoing Hg exposure in a dose-dependent fashion. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","dose dependent; mercury; toxicokinetics; urine","dental alloy;

Thirty-seven (37) children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were evaluated using the CARS and then tested for hand muscle strength using a hand grip dynamometer. Statistical analysis was then conducted to examine the relationship between autism severity and hand muscle strength. The model generated in the present study showed that the CARS score is a significant predictor of Max Hand Muscle Score after adjustment for age, race, gender, year of birth, and a history of prior chelation therapy. Evidence suggests that hand grip strength in children with ASD is related to the severity of the disorder.

Material/Methods: Thirty subjects diagnosed with an ASD were randomly assigned to receive a standardized regimen (50 mg L-carnitine/kg bodyweight/day) of liquid L-carnitine (n=19) or placebo (n=11) for 3-months. Measures included changes in professionally completed Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), hand muscle testing, and modified clinical global impression (CGI) forms; parent completed Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), treatment adherence measurement (TAM), frequency and intensity of side effect rating (FISER)/global rating of side effect burden (GRSEB)/patient report of incidence of side effects (PRISE) forms; and lab testing. Results: Significant improvements were observed in CARS (-2.03, 95% CI=-3.7 to -0.31), CGI (-0.69, 95% CI=-1.1 to -0.06), and ATEC scores. Significant correlations between changes in serum free-carnitine levels and positive clinical changes were observed for hand muscle strength (R2=0.23, P=0.046), cognitive scores (R2=0.27, P=0.019), and CARS scores (R2=0.20, P=0.047). Study subjects were protocol- compliant (average adherence was &gt;85%) and generally well-tolerated the L-carnitine therapy given. Conclusions: L-carnitine therapy (50 mg/kilogram-bodyweight/day) administered for 3-months significantly improved several clinical measurements of ASD severity, but subsequent studies are recommended.","Autism spectrum disorder; Carnitine; Mitochondrial dysfunction","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; carnitine; placebo; alanine aminotransferase blood level; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; autism; autism treatment evaluation checklist; body weight; child; Childhood Autism Rating Scale; clinical article; Clinical Global Impression scale; cognition; comparative study; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug tolerance; erythrocyte count; female; frequency and intensity of side effect rating; global rating of side effect burden; hand muscle; human; leukocyte count; loading drug dose; male; muscle strength; patient compliance; patient report of incidence of side effects; preschool child; prospective study; psychologic assessment; psychological rating scale; randomized controlled trial; school child; structure activity relation; treatment adherence measurement; treatment duration; treatment response; unspecified side effect; urea nitrogen blood level; Carnitine; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Placebos",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; carnitine, 461-06-3, 541-15-1, 56-99-5; Carnitine, 541-15-1; Placebos","carnitor, Sigma Tau, United States","Sigma Tau, United States",,"Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders - Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, United States,2006 (2009) MMWR Surveill Summ, 58, pp. 1-20. , Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2006 Principal Investigators; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Gerlai, J., Gerlai, R., Autism: A large unmet medical need and a complex research problem (2003) Physiol Behav, 79, pp. 461-470; Lombard, J.L., Autism: A mitochondrial disorder?

In our study, urinary porphyrin concentrations were examined in normal children 8-18 years-old from a reanalysis of data provided from a randomized, prospective clinical trial that was designed to evaluate the potential health consequences of prolonged exposure to Hg from dental amalgam fillings (the parent study). Our analysis examined dose-dependent correlations between increasing Hg exposure from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins utilizing statistical models with adjustments for the baseline level (i.e. study year 1) of the following variables: urinary Hg, each urinary porphyrin measure, gender, race, and the level of lead (Pb) in each subject's blood. Significant dose-dependent correlations between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins associated with Hg body-burden (pentacarboxyporphyrin, precoproporphyrin, and coproporphyrin) were observed. Overall, 5-10% increases in Hg-associated porphyrins for subjects receiving an average number of dental amalgam fillings in comparison to subjects receiving only composite fillings were observed over the 8-year course of the study. In contrast, no significant correlations were observed between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins not associated with Hg body-burden (uroporphyrin, heptacarboxyporphyrin, and hexacarboxyporphyrin). In conclusion, our study, in contrast to the no-effect results published from the parent study, further establishes the sensitivity and specificity of specific urinary porphyrins as a biomarker for low-level Hg body-burden, and also reveals that dental amalgams are a significant chronic contributor to Hg body-burden. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2010.","Body burden; Dental amalgam; Mercury; Porphyrin","biological marker; coproporphyrin; dental alloy; heptacarboxyporphyrin; hexacarboxyporphyrin; lead; mercury; pentacarboxyporphyrin; porphyrin; porphyrin derivative; precoproporphyrin; unclassified drug; uroporphyrin; mercury; porphyrin; article; blood analysis; body burden; child; child health; clinical assessment; controlled study; diagnostic value; health hazard; human; lead blood level; long term exposure; mercurialism; risk assessment; school child; sensitivity and specificity; urinalysis; urine level; chemistry; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; female; male; randomized controlled trial; urine; Animalia; Child; Dental Amalgam; Female; Humans; Male; Mercury; Porphyrins",,"coproporphyrin, 27121-71-7; dental alloy, 8049-85-2; heptacarboxyporphyrin, 25744-38-1; lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; porphyrin, 24869-67-8; uroporphyrin, 18273-06-8, 26316-36-9, 553-18-4, 607-14-7; Dental Amalgam, 8049-85-2; Mercury, 7439-97-6; Porphyrins",,,,"Abraham, J.E., Svare, C.W., Frank, C.W., The effect of dental amalgam restorations on blood mercury levels (1984) Journal of Dental Research, 63 (1), pp. 71-73; Austin, D.W., Shandley, K., An investigation of porphyrinuria in Australian children with autism (2008) J Toxicol Environ Health A, 71 (20), pp. 1349-1351; Bowers, M.A., Aicher, L.D., Davis, H.A., Woods, J.S., Quantitative determination of porphyrins in rat and human urine and evaluation of urinary urinary porphyrin profiles during mercury and lead exposures (1992) J Lab Clin Med, 120 (2), pp. 272-281; Brewster, M.A., Biomarkers of xenobiotic exposures (1988) Ann Clin Lab Sci, 18 (4), pp. 306-317; Buchet, J.P., Lauwerys, R., Roels, H., Bernard, A., Relationship between exposure to heavy metals and prevalance of renal dysfunction (1980) Archives of Toxicology, 45 (SUPPL.4), pp. 215-218; Derouen, T.A., Leroux, B.G., Marin, M.D., Townes, B.D., Woods, J.S., Leitão, J., Castro-Caldas, A., Braveman, N., (2002) Control Clin Trials, 23 (3), pp. 301-320; Derouen, T.A., Marin, M.D., Leroux, B.G., Townes, B.D., Woods, J.S., Leitão, J., Castro-Caldas, A., Martins, I.P., (2006) JAMA, 295 (15), pp. 1784-1792; Dunn, J.E., Trachtenberg, F.L., Barregard, L., Bellinger, D., McKinlay, S., Scalp hair and urine mercury content of children in the Northeast United States: The New England Children's Amalgam Trial (2008) Environmental Research, 107 (1), pp. 79-88. , DOI 10.1016/j.envres.2007.08.015, PII S0013935107001867; Echeverria, D., Heyer, N.J., Martin, M.D., Naleway, C.A., Woods, J.S., Bittner, A.C., Behavioral effects of low-level exposure to Hg0 among dentists (1995) Neurotoxicol Teratol, 17 (2), pp. 161-168; Fowler, B.A., Oskarsson, A., Woods, J.S., Metal- and metalloid-induced porphyrinurias.

Of particular recent concern, routine administering of Thimerosal-containing biologics/childhood vaccines have become significant sources of Hg exposure for some fetuses/infants. This study was undertaken to investigate cellular damage among in vitro human neuronal (SH-SY-5Y neuroblastoma and 1321N1 astrocytoma) and fetal (nontransformed) model systems using cell vitality assays and microscope-based digital image capture techniques to assess potential damage induced by Thimerosal and other metal compounds (aluminum (Al) sulfate, lead (Pb)(II) acetate, methylmercury (MeHg) hydroxide, and mercury (Hg)(II) chloride) where the cation was reported to exert adverse effects on developing cells. Thimerosal-associated cellular damage was also evaluated for similarity to pathophysiological findings observed in patients diagnosed with autistic disorders (ADs). Thimerosal-induced cellular damage as evidenced by concentration- and time-dependent mitochondrial damage, reduced oxidative-reduction activity, cellular degeneration, and cell death in the in vitro human neuronal and fetal model systems studied. Thimerosal at low nanomolar (nM) concentrations induced significant cellular toxicity in human neuronal and fetal cells. Thimerosal-induced cytoxicity is similar to that observed in AD pathophysiologic studies. Thimerosal was found to be significantly more toxic than the other metal compounds examined. Future studies need to be conducted to evaluate additional mechanisms underlying Thimerosal-induced cellular damage and assess potential co-exposures to other compounds that may increase or decrease Thimerosal-mediated toxicity. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Autism; Glial; Lead; Mercuric; Mercury; Neurodevelopmental","Autism; Glial; Mercuric; Mercury; Neurodevelopmental; Cell death; Chlorine compounds; Computer crime; Lead; Lead compounds; Mercury (metal); Organometallics; Patient monitoring; Toxicity; Mercury compounds; bioactivity; cytology; health risk; medicine; mental health; mercury (element); mitochondrion; neurology; organometallic compound; pollution exposure; public health; toxic material; vaccine",,,,,,"Bigham, M., Copes, R., Thiomersal in vaccines: Balancing the risk of adverse effects with the risk of vaccine-preventable disease (2005) Drug Safety: An International Journal of Medical Toxicology and Drug Experience, 28, pp. 89-101; Burbacher, T.M., Shen, D.D., Liberato, N., Grant, K.S., Cernichiari, E., Clarkson, T.W., Comparison of blood and brain mercury levels in infant monkeys exposed to methylmercury or vaccines containing Thimerosal (2005) Environmental Health Perspectives, 113, pp. 1015-21; Chauhaun, A., Chauhaun, V., Oxidative stress in autism (2006) Pathophysiology: The Official Journal of the International Society for Pathophysiology/ISP, 13, pp. 171-81; Chrysochoou, C., Rutishauser, C., Rauber-Luthy, C., Neuhaus, T., Boltshauser, E., Superti-Furga, A., An 11 month-old boy with psychomotor regression and auto-aggressive behaviour (2003) European Journal of Pediatrics, 162, pp. 559-61; LDDI Scientific consensus statement on environmental agents associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, pp. 1-35. , Collaborative on Health and the Environment's Learning and Developmental Disabilities Initiative 2008; Counter, S.A., Buchanan, L.H., Ortega, F., Laurell, G., Elevated blood mercury and neurootological observations in children of the Ecuadorian gold mines (2002) Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health A, 65, pp. 149-63; Deth, R., Muratore, C., Benzecry, J., Power-Charnitsky, V.A., Waly, M., How environmental and genetic factors combine to cause autism: A redox/methylation hypothesis (2008) Neurotoxicology, 29, pp. 190-201; Elferink, J.G., Thimerosal: A versatile sulfhydryl reagent, calcium mobilizer, and cell functionmodulating agent (1999) General Pharmacology, 33, pp. 1-6; Overloaded?

Elemental/ inorganic Hg is released into the air/water where it becomes methylated and accumulates in animal tissues. The US population is primarily exposed to methyl-Hg by fish consumption. In addition, many pharmaceuticals have been, and some continue to be, a ubiquitous source of danger because they contain mercurials. Mercurials may be found in drugs for the eye, ear, nose, throat, and skin; in bleaching creams; as preservatives in cosmetics, tooth pastes, lens solutions, vaccines, allergy test and immunotherapy solutions; in antiseptics, disinfectants, and contraceptives; in fungicides and herbicides; in dental fillings and thermometers; and many other products. Hg has been found to cause immune, sensory, neurological, motor, and behavioural dysfunctions similar to traits defining/associated with ASDs, and that these similarities extend to neuroanatomy, neurotransmitters, and biochemistry. Furthermore, a review of molecular mechanisms indicates that Hg exposure can induce death, disorganization and/or damage to selected neurons in the brain similar to that seen in recent ASD brain pathology studies, and this alteration may likely produce the symptoms by which ASDs are diagnosed. Finally, a review of treatments suggests that ASD patients who undergo protocols to reduce Hg and/or its effects show significant clinical improvements in some cases. In conclusion, the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence favours acceptance that Hg exposure is capable of causing some ASDs.","Autistic; Glutathione; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Testosterone","advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; amalgam; antiandrogen; chelating agent; diphtheria pertussis tetanus Haemophilus influenzae type b hepatitis B vaccine; endotoxin; Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; leuprorelin; major histocompatibility antigen; mercury; metallothionein; methionine synthase; mitogen activated protein kinase; nerve growth factor; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; porphyrin; prasterone; prasterone sulfate; rhesus D antibody; thiomersal; uroporphyrin; vaccine; Asperger syndrome; autism; blood brain barrier; blood level; brain level; chelation therapy; clinical feature; cytotoxicity; developmental disorder; disease association; DNA fragmentation; DNA synthesis; drug formulation; drug safety; environmental exposure; epidemic; fetotoxicity; food contamination; food poisoning; genetic susceptibility; hair level; human; immunogenetics; mercurialism; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; perinatal drug exposure; review; sex difference; urine level; Autistic Disorder; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mercury",,"advanced glycation end product receptor, 198785-73-8, 247590-69-8; Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, 126161-67-9; leuprorelin, 53714-56-0, 74381-53-6; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; methionine synthase, 37290-90-7; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; nerve growth factor, 9061-61-4; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; porphyrin, 24869-67-8; prasterone sulfate, 651-48-9; prasterone, 53-43-0; thiomersal, 54-64-8; uroporphyrin, 18273-06-8, 26316-36-9, 553-18-4, 607-14-7; Mercury, 7439-97-6","lupron",,,"Clarkson, T.W., Magos, L., The toxicology of mercury and its chemical compounds (2006) Crit Rev Toxicol, 36, pp. 609-662; Winship, K.A., Organic mercury compounds and their toxicity (1986) Adverse Drug React Acute Poisoning Rev, 5, pp. 141-180; Winship, K.A., Toxicity of mercury and its inorganic salts (1985) Adverse Drug React Acute Poisoning Rev, 4, pp. 129-160; Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., Geier, M.R., A review of thimerosal (Merthiolate) and its ethylmercury breakdown product: Specific historical considerations regarding safety and effectiveness (2007) J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev, 10, pp. 575-596; Blood and hair mercury levels in young children and women of childbearing age - United States, 1999 (2001) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 50, pp. 140-143. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC; Pichichero, M.E., Cernichiari, E., Lopreiato, J., Treanor, J., Mercury concentrations and metabolism in infants receiving vaccines containing thiomersal: A descriptive study (2002) Lancet, 360, pp. 1737-1741; Belson, M.G., Schier, J.G., Patel, M.C., Case definitions for chemical poisoning (2005) MMWR Recomm Rep, 54, pp. 1-24; Stajich, G.V., Lopez, G.P., Harry, S.W., Sexson, W.R., Iatrogenic exposure to mercury after hepatitis B vaccination in preterm infants (2000) J Pediatr, 136, pp. 679-681; Marques, R.C., Dorea, J.G., Fonseca, M.F., Bastos, W.R., Malm, O., Hair mercury in breast-fed infants exposed to thimerosal-preserved vaccines (2007) Eur J Pediatr, 166, pp. 935-941; Redwood, L., Bernard, S., Brown, D., Predicted mercury concentrations in hair from infant immunizations: Cause for concern (2001) Neurotoxicology, 22, pp. 691-697; Bigham M, Copes R.

On February 3, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed RotaTeq™ (Merck and Co.), a bioengineered combination of five human-bovine hybridized reassortment rotaviruses. In August of 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended RotaTeq for routine vaccination of US infants administered orally at the ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Material/Methods: An evaluation of data reported to VAERS following the first five quarters of post-marketing surveillance of RotaTeq was undertaken. Trends in adverse events reported following RotaTeq and cost-effectiveness calculations of RotaTeq in the context of the disease burden of rotavirus in the US were examined. Results: From February 3, 2006 through July 31, 2007, a total of 160 (of the 165 reported) intussusception and 11 (of the 16 reported) Kawasaki disease adverse event reports were identified when RotaTeq was administered or co-administered with other vaccines. Time-trend analyses showed that there were significant increases in the total number of intussusception and Kawasaki disease adverse events entered into VAERS in comparison to previous years. Conclusions: These observations, coupled with limited rotavirus disease burden, cost-effectiveness, and potential contact viral transmission concerns, raise serious questions regarding the use of RotaTeq in the US. Healthcare providers should diligently report adverse events following RotaTeq vaccination to VAERS, and those who have experienced a vaccine-associated adverse event should be made aware that they may be eligible for compensation from the no-fault National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP). © Med Sci Monit, 2008.","Gastroenteritis; Gastrointestinal hemorrhage; Rotavirus infection; Vaccine adverse event reporting system","Rotavirus vaccine; vaccine; article; cost effectiveness analysis; drug safety; health care cost; health care policy; human; intussusception; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Animals; Cattle; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Infant; Male; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Rotavirus; Rotavirus Infections; Rotavirus Vaccines; Vaccines, Attenuated",,"RotaTeq; Rotavirus Vaccines; Vaccines, Attenuated","rotateq, Merck and Co, United States","Merck and Co, United States",,"Postmarketing monitoring of intussusception after RotaTeq vaccination - United States, February 1, 2006-February 15, 2007 (2007) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 56, pp. 218-222. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Amarilla, A., Espinola, E.E., Galeano, M.E., Rotavirus infection in the Paraguayan population from 2004 to 2005: High incidence or rotavirus strains with short electropherotype in children and adults (2007) Med Sci Monit, 13 (7), pp. CR333-CR337; Intussusception among recipients of rotavirus vaccine - United States, 1998-1999 (1999) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 48, pp. 577-581. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Geier, D.A., Geier, M.R., Gastrointestinal reactions and rotavirus vaccination based upon analysis of the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database for 1999.
